Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves him being repeatedly questioned about his sexuality by his girlfriend, which he finds frustrating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times, which he's okay with explaining. But his girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay, and now the girlfriend keeps questioning him. She even checked his porn history, which he found annoying. He gets mad because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality and isn't taken seriously.\n\nThe author's argument is that if he were gay, he would have come out by now, and he's frustrated with the repeated questioning. He also points out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi and he thinks they should be past this in 2019.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: maybe she's concerned about his performance in bed, which could relate to anxiety or other issues. But instead of addressing that directly, she's questioning his sexuality. That could stem from her own insecurities or lack of communication. Her friend's input might have influenced her, leading to invalidating his self-identification.\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and trust. The author has a right to his self-identified sexuality, and it's important that his girlfriend respects his statement. However, her persistent questioning might indicate underlying issues in the relationship, like trust problems or communication gaps. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for being angry?\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he's being asked repeatedly despite clearly stating he's straight. However, his anger towards his girlfriend and her friend for not taking him seriously could be seen as justified. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being asked in a way that's disrespectful or intrusive (like checking his phone), then the girlfriend is at fault. The author's reaction to being questioned is a natural response to being doubted, especially if he feels it's unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might be a sign that she's not respecting his autonomy or the trust in their relationship. The author's anger arises from being made to defend his identity, which is a valid feeling. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's behavior and lack of trust. The author is reacting to a breach of trust and respect, so he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
