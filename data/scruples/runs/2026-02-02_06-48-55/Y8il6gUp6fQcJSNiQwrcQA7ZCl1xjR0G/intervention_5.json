Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually just answers and it's not an issue. However, during their 5-month relationship, she started questioning him, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his straightness, especially since he's not gay and it's 2019, so he expects people to take him at his word. He's annoyed at her and her friend for not accepting his statement.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe author's side: He's being accused of not being straight by his girlfriend, which is causing him stress. He's answered her questions, and she's still doubting him. He feels it's his right to be taken at his word, especially in a relationship where trust is supposed to be present. His frustration is valid if she's not respecting his boundaries or his honesty.\n\nGirlfriend's side: Maybe she's concerned about his performance during sex (nervousness, trouble climaxing) and might be worried about his orientation, perhaps even feeling insecure. However, checking his porn history is a big breach of trust. If she's bi, she might have her own insecurities or past experiences leading her to question him. But repeatedly doubting his sexuality after he's stated it is problematic.\n\nLGBTQ+ context: The author mentions that he's heterosexual, so this isn't the same as a LGBTQ+ person coming out. However, the girlfriend might be influenced by her friend's suggestion. But the author is right that if someone is straight, they should be believed without needing proof. The girlfriend's actions (checking porn history) are invasive and not respectful.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. If the author is honest and the girlfriend isn't believing him, that's an issue. However, the author's annoyance is understandable. The problem is that the girlfriend is not respecting his autonomy and his answers, which can erode trust. \n\nBut the author's frustration leading to anger might be seen as justified if she's not respecting his boundaries. However, how he expressed that anger matters. The girlfriend's behavior is definitely wrong, but the author's reaction (getting mad) might be acceptable as a response to her not respecting him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's standing up for himself against her lack of trust, then no. But if he's being dismissive of her concerns without understanding their root, maybe. But the scenario doesn't show him addressing her concerns, just reacting to her actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
