Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. The main issue here is the girlfriend's repeated questioning and the author's frustration with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect in a relationship. The author mentions that he doesn't mind being asked if he's gay in other contexts, but in this case, it's his girlfriend who keeps bringing it up. That's different because it's a personal relationship, and trust is a key component. If someone is in a committed relationship, they should generally trust each other without needing constant reassurance. The girlfriend's repeated questioning might indicate a lack of trust, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend told a friend about his nervousness during sex, which led to the initial questioning. That could be a breach of privacy or trust, depending on what was discussed. The fact that the girlfriend searched through the author's porn history is another point. Even if her intentions were to confirm his sexuality, going through his private information without consent is a violation of privacy. That's a significant issue because it's about respecting boundaries.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because he's being asked the same question repeatedly despite having already stated he's straight. The girlfriend's continued doubt could be seen as dismissive of his identity. The author is right to feel that he should be taken at face value, especially since he's not part of the LGBTQ+ community and doesn't face the same challenges in coming out. The girlfriend, being bi, should theoretically understand the importance of respecting one's self-identified sexuality.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend might be struggling with her own insecurities or past experiences. Maybe she's dealing with her bisexuality and has doubts about her partner's orientation. But that doesn't justify the repeated questioning or the invasion of privacy. The key here is whether her actions are respectful and considerate of the author's feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn terms of the author's response, getting mad is a natural reaction to being disrespected. The question is whether his response is justified. If he communicated his frustration calmly and tried to address the underlying issues, that would be healthy. But if he was confrontational or dismissive of her feelings, that could be problematic. However, based on the description, it seems like the author is upset because he's been asked multiple times and felt his privacy was invaded. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here\u2014lack of trust, invasion of privacy, and not respecting his stated sexuality. The author has the right to be upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy violated. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
