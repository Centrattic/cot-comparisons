Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man, and his girlfriend is bisexual. She keeps asking him if he's gay, which is annoying him. He's been asked before by others, but with his girlfriend, it's been several times since they started dating five months ago. She even checked his porn history, which he found frustrating. He's upset because he feels like he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since his girlfriend is bi. He's frustrated that she doesn't take his sexuality seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's straight and doesn't want to be questioned repeatedly about his sexuality. It's his right to self-identify, and he's annoyed that his girlfriend doesn't take his word for it. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for being curious or concerned. Maybe she's trying to understand his sexual behavior, like the initial issues during sex, or perhaps she has personal insecurities. But that doesn't excuse repeated questioning after he's already stated his orientation.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect. In a relationship, you should trust each other's self-identity. If the author has clearly communicated that he's straight, then the girlfriend should respect that. Repeatedly questioning it, even after being told, could be seen as a lack of trust. The fact that she even looked into his porn history is invasive and potentially a breach of privacy. That action alone might be a red flag in the relationship.\n\nBut then, maybe the girlfriend has her own reasons. Maybe she's insecure because she's bi and wants to confirm his orientation to feel secure. Or maybe she's confused by his behavior. However, the author has the right to his sexuality, and her actions might stem from a place of insecurity rather than valid concerns. It's possible that the girlfriend is struggling with her own issues, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's being asked to constantly defend something that's part of his identity. Being in the LGBTQ+ community, people often face questioning their identity, which can be stressful. The author is in the opposite position, which might make it even more irritating because he's the one being questioned despite clearly stating his orientation.\n\nAlso, the context is 2019, so societal attitudes are supposed to be more accepting. The author points out that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable by now, which is a valid point. It's important to respect self-identified labels unless there's a compelling reason to doubt them. There's no indication that the author is being dishonest about his sexuality; he's just being asked repeatedly without valid cause.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's behavior, repeatedly questioning his sexuality after he's stated it could be seen as disrespectful. The act of checking his porn history is invasive and not a healthy way to address concerns. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and this behavior might erode that trust. The author has every right to be upset about being asked again and again, especially by someone he's in a committed relationship with.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's reaction is justified. He's not in the wrong for being frustrated with his girlfriend's repeated questioning and the invasive actions. His girlfriend needs to respect his self-identified sexuality and not question it without valid reasons. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
