Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's heterosexual and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, which he's fine with. However, his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality despite him stating he's straight. She even checked his porn history, which is a bit invasive. The author feels frustrated because he's not being taken seriously when he says he's straight, even though he's comfortable with his sexuality. He also points out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi and he's not being accepted, even in 2019.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated questioning, the invasion of privacy (checking porn history), and the frustration from the author. It's important to consider communication in relationships. If the author has clearly stated his sexuality and the girlfriend continues to doubt it, that could be a problem. The girlfriend's friend also doesn't take it seriously, which adds to the issue.\n\nThe author isn't being bigoted; he's expressing frustration over being made to defend his sexuality when he's confident about it. His girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or lack of trust, but repeatedly questioning and invading privacy isn't healthy. The author's reaction is valid because everyone has the right to be believed when stating their identity, especially in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's actions are problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being disbelieved and having his privacy invaded. The situation shows a communication breakdown, but the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's frustration. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
