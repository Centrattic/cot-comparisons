Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. Let me start by looking at both sides.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality before, but usually, people accept his answer. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, keeps doubting him. She even checked his porn history, which is a privacy issue. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially in 2019, and he's not being taken seriously. He finds it hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for questioning. Maybe she's not in a trusting place, or she's anxious about the relationship. If the author had performance issues initially, she might be worried about underlying issues, even if it's not a valid assumption. But repeatedly questioning and invading privacy (checking porn history) is definitely crossing a line. That's a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's frustration is about not being trusted, which is a valid emotion. However, his anger and the way he's approaching the situation might be problematic. He's comparing it to LGBTQ+ people's experiences, which could come off as dismissive of their real struggles. But he's not being in the wrong just for feeling frustrated. The real issue is the girlfriend's lack of trust and invasion of privacy. The author might need to communicate his feelings better, but he's not entirely at fault here. The main problem lies with the girlfriend's actions.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, especially given the privacy breach and lack of trust from his partner.\n"
