Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual man dating a bisexual woman. She initially thought he might be gay because of some nervousness during sex and maybe other reasons. She even checked his porn history. He got mad because he's straight and feels he doesn't need to defend that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that being asked repeatedly is frustrating. He's clear about his sexuality, and the constant questioning is making him defensive. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for doubting, maybe due to his behavior or her own insecurities. She's bisexual, so perhaps her experiences influence her perceptions. The fact that she shared this with a friend who suggested he might be gay complicates things.\n\nIt's 2019 in the story, which is a few years ago. The author mentions that in 2019, he should be comfortable with his sexuality if he were gay. However, the girlfriend's actions of checking his porn history and repeatedly asking seem intrusive. Trust is a big part of a relationship. If he's honest about being straight, she should respect that unless there's a valid reason to doubt. But maybe there's more to her behavior. Maybe she's insecure about his fidelity or has trust issues. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because people should be able to self-identify their sexuality without constant questioning. However, if the girlfriend has legitimate concerns based on behavior, she might feel the need to address it. But checking his porn history crosses a boundary. That's a privacy issue. If he's in a committed relationship, his porn preferences are his business unless it affects their relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is reasonable. He's upset about being questioned repeatedly after already stating his orientation. That's a valid feeling. The girlfriend's actions, especially checking his history, might stem from insecurity, but it's still not acceptable. The author is right to feel frustrated if he's being made to defend his identity. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if there were underlying issues in their relationship that caused her to question him, that's on her. But the question is about whether the author is wrong for getting mad. The answer would be no because it's reasonable to be upset by constant questioning and invasion of privacy.\n"
