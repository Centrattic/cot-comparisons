Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually just says he's straight. Now, his girlfriend keeps questioning him, even searching his phone for porn history. He feels it's frustrating because he's not taken seriously.\n\nSo, why would the girlfriend keep doing this? Maybe she's insecure or has her own issues. The author mentions that during sex, he had trouble climaxing at first. That might have made her doubt his sexuality, especially if she's not confident in their relationship. Her friend might have reinforced that idea. But the author is upset because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight. He's not in the LGBTQ+ community, so he's confused why he's not accepted at face value.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he's being honest about his sexuality, then his frustration is understandable. People should be able to self-identify without constant questioning. But maybe the girlfriend's behavior is due to her own insecurities or lack of trust. The author isn't wrong for being upset if he feels his word isn't respected. However, maybe he could have addressed it calmly instead of just getting mad. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. The author isn't being dishonest; he's being asked unnecessarily. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
