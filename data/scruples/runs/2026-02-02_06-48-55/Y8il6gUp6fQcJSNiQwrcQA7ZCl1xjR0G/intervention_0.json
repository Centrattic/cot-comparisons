Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past but usually doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, started questioning his sexuality after some initial nervousness during sex. She even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he's had to defend his sexuality, especially since he's in a relationship with a bi woman and he's been clear he's straight.\n\nNow, the author is upset because his girlfriend keeps doubting him. He feels it's 2019 and if he were gay, he'd have come out by now. He's frustrated about having to prove his straightness. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, being repeatedly questioned about his sexuality despite stating he's straight can be frustrating. It's about trust and respect. If someone has already stated their identity, constant questioning can feel invalidating. The girlfriend might be doing this out of insecurity or her friend's influence, but it's still affecting the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons. If she's bisexual and maybe has had experiences where partners weren't truthful, her questions could stem from a place of wanting to be sure. However, checking his porn history is invasive and not a healthy way to resolve doubts. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because trust should be present in a relationship. His girlfriend's actions might be driven by her own issues, but it's still affecting their dynamic. The author isn't the one denying his sexuality; he's the one being questioned despite being clear. \n\nBut then again, if the girlfriend has legitimate concerns, maybe there's an underlying issue. However, the author has made his stance clear, so the girlfriend should respect that unless there's a reason to doubt. The fact that she's checking his history is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author getting upset is understandable. He's not the one being invalidating; he's the one being doubted. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in feeling frustrated because his sexuality has been declared, and the repeated questioning without trust is the problem.\n"
