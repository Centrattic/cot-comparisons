Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author is straight, in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She's been questioning his sexuality because of some past nervousness during sex and maybe other factors. He's told her he's straight, but she keeps asking again, even checking his porn history. Now he's frustrated that he has to defend his sexuality.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author feels that he should be believed when he states his sexuality. It's 2019, and he's living in a time where LGBTQ+ acceptance is more prevalent. He might feel that his identity as straight should be accepted without question. He might see her repeated questioning as a lack of trust or respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She's bisexual, so maybe she has different experiences or might be more open to questioning. However, if she's in a relationship with him, she might have her own insecurities or misunderstandings. Her friend's influence could have planted the idea that he's gay. Repeatedly questioning his sexuality and checking his porn history might be invasive and not respectful. \n\nThe key points are whether the girlfriend's actions are within a healthy relationship dynamic. Trust and respect are crucial. If she's not taking his direct answers seriously and is instead digging into his privacy (porn history), that's a red flag. The author being upset about this is understandable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's being defensive and not addressing her concerns, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the problem seems to stem from her not respecting his stated sexuality, which is the core issue. The author's frustration is valid if he feels his identity is being doubted without cause. \n\nIn terms of hypocrisy, the author points out that if the roles were reversed, he might not take it seriously. So, if the girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community, she should understand the importance of respecting someone's self-identified sexuality. \n\nSo, the author's anger is a response to her lack of trust and repeated questioning. Since the girlfriend's actions are invasive and dismissive of his clear statements, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The real issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's reaction to it. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
