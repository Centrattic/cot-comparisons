Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The scenario involves the author being a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. The girlfriend has questioned his sexuality multiple times, even searching his porn history, which the author finds frustrating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that he's being unfairly questioned about his sexuality, especially since he's already stated he's straight. He's annoyed because it's becoming repetitive and he doesn't see why he has to defend his sexuality. On the other hand, the girlfriend's concern might stem from initial insecurities or misunderstandings. When they first started dating, he had trouble during sex, which led her to talk to a friend who suggested he might be gay. Her actions, while perhaps overstepping, might come from a place of wanting to ensure compatibility or her own peace of mind.\n\nNow, thinking about communication in relationships. It's important that both partners feel heard and respected. The author's frustration is valid because being forced to repeatedly justify one's identity can be hurtful. However, the girlfriend's behavior might be rooted in her own anxieties or lack of trust. The author getting angry could be seen as a reaction to feeling disrespected, but maybe he could have addressed it more calmly instead of just being upset. \n\nAlso, the context of their relationship matters. The girlfriend is bi, which might mean she's more open to different orientations, but that doesn't eliminate the possibility of her having personal insecurities. The author's point about 2019 and being past such issues is a good one; however, people's experiences and acceptance levels vary. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his history, are invasive and not okay regardless, but the underlying reason might not be entirely her fault if she felt uncertain.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the repeated questioning and invasion of privacy. But maybe he could have communicated his feelings more clearly from the start. The girlfriend, on the other hand, should have trusted his statement and not pried further without addressing her own concerns through open dialogue. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's frustration is justified, but his reaction might not be entirely appropriate. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's persistent and invasive behavior. So, the answer is likely B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
