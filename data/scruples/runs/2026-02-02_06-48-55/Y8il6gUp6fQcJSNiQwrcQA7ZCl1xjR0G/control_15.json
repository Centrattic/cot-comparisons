Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The author is straight, has been asked before but usually doesn't mind. His girlfriend, who's bisexual, started questioning his sexuality after a nervous moment during sex. She told a friend, who suggested he might be gay. The author told her he's straight, but she keeps bringing it up again, even checked his porn history. Now he's annoyed and thinks it's hypocritical, given his girlfriend is bi and they're in 2019.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. First, the girlfriend's behavior: repeatedly questioning his sexuality despite his answers. That sounds like a lack of trust. The author has the right to feel frustrated if his statements aren't respected. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and possibly a breach of privacy. That's a red flag in a relationship.\n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to being disbelieved and not being respected. The girlfriend's friend is also involved in spreading the idea, which adds to the problem. The author isn't being judgmental about her bisexuality, but he's being asked to justify his heterosexuality, which is different. It's about mutual respect and trust. The girlfriend should accept his answer unless there's a valid reason to doubt it. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because his girlfriend's actions are intrusive and disrespectful. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
