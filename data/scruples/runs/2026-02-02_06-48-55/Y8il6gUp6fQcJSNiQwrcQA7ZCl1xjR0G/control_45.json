Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times by her, and he's getting frustrated. She initially thought he might be gay because of his nervousness during sex, and she even checked his porn history. Now, after months, she's still questioning him. He's upset because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality and isn't taken seriously, even though he's clear about being straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, being repeatedly questioned about his sexuality when he's already stated he's straight could be frustrating. He mentions that others have assumed he's gay before, but he's comfortable with his identity. It's reasonable for him to want his partner to accept his word without needing constant validation. The fact that his girlfriend is bi might make him feel that she should understand and respect people's self-identified sexuality without doubt.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions could stem from concern or insecurity. Maybe she's trying to understand his sexual orientation to ensure compatibility in their relationship. However, checking his porn history is an invasion of privacy and not a healthy way to address her doubts. If she's truly committed to the relationship and he's already stated his orientation, her repeated questioning and lack of trust could be problematic. It's 2019, and societal norms have evolved to a point where respecting someone's self-declared identity is expected, regardless of personal biases.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly despite his clear statements. His frustration is valid, especially when his partner isn't respecting his self-identification. The girlfriend's actions suggest a lack of trust and maybe internalized biases against his sexuality, which isn't acceptable in a healthy relationship. The friend's role in fueling the doubt also plays a part, but the main issue is the girlfriend's continued questioning. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. If someone in a relationship doesn't take your self-identification seriously and keeps doubting you, that's a red flag. The fact that the girlfriend is bi but still has issues with his straight identity is contradictory, as she might understand the importance of self-declared identity in a relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about this situation.\n"
