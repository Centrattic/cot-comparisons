Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend has repeatedly asked him if he's gay, even after he's told her he's straight. The author is frustrated because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality, and it's getting old. He even mentions that she checked his porn history, which is pretty invasive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that being asked repeatedly is annoying and that he's clear about his sexuality. He feels his girlfriend isn't taking his word seriously. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be worried about something\u2014maybe her insecurities, or she's heard something from her friend? The fact that she told her friend about his performance issues and then got the idea he's gay might indicate some underlying issues, like trust or insecurity in the relationship.\n\nThe author is upset because he's heterosexual and doesn't see why he should have to prove it. But from the girlfriend's side, maybe she's concerned about the initial hesitation during sex and is trying to understand or address any issues. However, repeatedly questioning his sexuality after he's stated he's straight could be dismissive of his feelings. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. Checking his phone without permission is definitely a problem, regardless of the reason. That's a breach of trust.\n\nThe author getting mad is a natural reaction to being questioned too much and having his privacy invaded. But maybe he could have communicated his feelings better. However, the girlfriend's actions seem inappropriate. She should trust him, especially if she's bi and presumably open-minded. The fact that she's not taking his word for it and is instead using invasive methods to check his history is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated with her actions. He's in a committed relationship, and her behavior is disrespectful. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong), because the girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's frustration.\n"
