Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. She asked him if he's gay multiple times, even searching his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his heterosexuality, especially since he's comfortable with it. He thinks it's hypocritical given his girlfriend is bi.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the girlfriend's behavior. She's repeatedly questioning his sexuality after he's already stated he's straight. That could be seen as not respecting his self-identification. On the other hand, maybe she's trying to understand or has her own insecurities. But if she's bisexual, maybe she's more open-minded, so constant questioning might not be acceptable. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. If someone keeps doubting your identity despite clear statements, that's annoying. However, if his girlfriend has valid reasons, like not understanding his hesitation during sex, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the key here is that he's already told her he's straight and she's not taking it at face value. \n\nAlso, the fact that she told her friend, leading to the assumption he's gay, and then checking his porn history without consent is problematic. That's a privacy violation. So, the girlfriend's actions are questionable. \n\nThe author feeling upset about being doubted is not unreasonable. It's 2019, and assuming someone's sexuality without evidence isn't okay. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated. The girlfriend's actions are more in the wrong here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
