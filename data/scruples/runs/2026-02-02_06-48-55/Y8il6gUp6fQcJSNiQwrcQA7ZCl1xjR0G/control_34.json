Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a straight guy in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend has been repeatedly asking if he's gay, even checking his porn history. The author is getting frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word when he says he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is being asked about his sexuality multiple times, which seems intrusive. It's 2019, so maybe the expectation is that people should respect each other's stated identities without needing proof. However, the girlfriend might be acting out of concern or insecurity. The author's nervousness during sex led her to question his sexuality, and maybe she's trying to understand the situation better. But repeatedly asking and checking his history without permission could be a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his own identity and shouldn't have to defend it over and over. If he's straight and he's told her, then her continued questioning is disrespectful. The fact that she's bisexual might make her more open to the idea, but that doesn't mean she should doubt his sexuality. The author's frustration is valid because trust is important in a relationship. If the girlfriend doesn't trust him after he's been honest, that's a problem on her part. The author isn't at fault for being upset about this. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong."
