Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even going so far as checking his porn history. The author is getting annoyed because he's been clear he's straight, and he feels like he has to defend it repeatedly. He's asking if he's at fault for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is heterosexual, the girlfriend is bisexual. They've been dating five months. He had some initial performance issues, which the girlfriend discussed with a friend, leading her to suspect he's gay. She's asked multiple times, and he's answered he's straight. The girlfriend's friend seems to not accept his answer either. The author is upset because he feels he should be taken at his word, especially given that it's 2019 and LGBTQ+ issues are more accepted. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and he's supposed to be in a straight relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly about his sexuality despite having given clear answers. This could be frustrating, especially if he feels his word isn't trusted. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might be seen as invasive. The author is in a committed relationship, so it's reasonable he expects trust. The fact that she's questioning his sexuality repeatedly might indicate a lack of trust, which can be a valid source of frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be feeling insecure. The initial performance issues could have led her to question his confidence or sexuality. Since she's bisexual, maybe she's more attuned to issues around sexual orientation. However, repeatedly asking and prying into his private matters could be overstepping. The author's frustration is understandable because he's being asked to justify his sexuality when he's already stated it clearly. Trust is a cornerstone of relationships, and if one partner is constantly doubting the other, that's a problem.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong here because he has a right to be upset about being mistrusted. The girlfriend's actions suggest a lack of trust, which is a relationship issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being honest and feeling frustrated when his honesty isn't respected. The girlfriend's friend also plays a role here by influencing her thoughts, which might not be helpful. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier. If the girlfriend's questioning was bothering him, perhaps he should have communicated that. But from the story, it seems like he's been getting more annoyed over time. The fact that he's had performance issues might have made her more insecure, but that doesn't justify the repeated questioning. \n\nIn terms of the broader context, the author is in a straight relationship, and his sexuality isn't in question if he's been clear. The girlfriend's actions could be a trust issue. The author isn't obligated to prove his straightness repeatedly. So, the author's anger is a reaction to being mistrusted, which isn't his fault. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
