Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, which he's fine with, but now his girlfriend keeps bringing it up. The girlfriend started questioning him after he had some initial nerves during sex, which he's since resolved. She even checked his porn history, which he found invasive. The author is frustrated because he thinks he's made it clear he's straight, and he's annoyed that his girlfriend doesn't take his word for it. He compares the situation to LGBTQ+ people not being accepted, implying that he should be trusted without question.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, being questioned repeatedly about his sexuality when he's already stated he's straight can be frustrating, especially if he feels it's unnecessary. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the girlfriend might be coming from a place of insecurity or not fully trusting her partner. Maybe she's worried about his commitment or has past experiences that make her question his sexuality. \n\nThe key points here are consent and trust in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through his phone, are definitely a big no-no. That's a privacy violation. The author's frustration is understandable in that context. However, if the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality, that might indicate underlying issues in the relationship, like trust problems or communication issues. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. While the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, the author's response is anger. Is that justified? If the girlfriend is not respecting his boundaries (like checking his phone) and not believing him despite his clear answers, the author has a right to be upset. However, maybe the author could handle it more constructively instead of just getting angry. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be dismissing the girlfriend's feelings. If she has legitimate concerns or insecurities driving her to ask, then the author could be seen as not addressing her emotional needs. But the girlfriend's method of addressing it (invasion of privacy) is wrong. \n\nIn terms of the author's argument that if he were gay he'd be comfortable by now, that could come off as dismissive. It might invalidate the complexities of someone's journey in coming out. However, he clarifies he's straight, so maybe that's just his way of explaining his perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's repeated questions and invasive actions. His anger is a reaction to being disbelieved and having his privacy violated. The girlfriend is the one who needs to work on trust and communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
