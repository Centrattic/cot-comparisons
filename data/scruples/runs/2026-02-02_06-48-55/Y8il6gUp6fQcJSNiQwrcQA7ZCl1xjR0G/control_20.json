Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a straight guy, is dating a bisexual girlfriend who keeps questioning his sexuality. He got annoyed because she asked again if he's gay, and he's upset about her not taking his word for it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since he's been in a heterosexual relationship. It's 2019, and there's more acceptance now, so he might think that questioning someone's sexuality repeatedly isn't appropriate, even if it's coming from a place of curiosity.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons. The author mentioned that during their early sexual encounters, he was nervous and didn't climax, which he says hasn't been an issue since. His girlfriend might have picked up on that and, influenced by her friend, started doubting his sexuality. But that's her side of the story. The problem is that she's not taking his assurance seriously. \n\nNow, the key point here is that the author is heterosexual and the girlfriend is bisexual. The author is frustrated because he's being made to defend his sexuality when he's stated it clearly. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014could be seen as invasive and not trusting. Even if her intentions are not malicious, it's a breach of privacy and could be hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality without valid reasons, that's a problem. The author's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or not trusted. The girlfriend's friend contributing to this by suggesting he's gay without evidence could be part of the issue too. \n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend's curiosity is rooted in her own insecurities or lack of understanding. However, in a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's identity. The author is clear about his sexuality, so the girlfriend's continued questioning might be unwarranted. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because he's being put in a position where he has to constantly validate his sexuality, which isn't his responsibility. It's similar to how people in the LGBTQ+ community might feel when they're questioned about their identity, but in this case, the dynamic is different because the author is heterosexual. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the girlfriend's lack of trust and her friend's influence. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset. He has a right to be bothered by being repeatedly questioned without evidence or reason. The girlfriend might need to work on her trust and communication. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies with the girlfriend's actions and her friend's input, not the author for being upset about it. So the answer should be B.\n"
