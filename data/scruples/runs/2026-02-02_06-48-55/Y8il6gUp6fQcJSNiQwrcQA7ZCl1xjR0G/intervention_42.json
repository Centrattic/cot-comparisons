Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a straight guy upset because his bisexual girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality after he told her he's straight. He's annoyed because she even checked his porn history and keeps bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels like he should be taken at his word. He mentions that he's comfortable with his identity and that it's frustrating to have to defend it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have her reasons. Maybe she's insecure, or she's heard something from her friend, or maybe she's just trying to be sure because of her own experiences. But the key point is that after he told her he's straight, she's kept doubting him. That seems like a lack of trust. In a healthy relationship, trust is important. If he's communicated his sexuality clearly, it's not fair for her to keep questioning it. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to her behavior. If she's bisexual, maybe she's struggling with her own identity or has past issues. However, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset if she's not respecting his stated sexuality. The fact that he's had this issue before and it's been months since he told her makes the repeated questioning seem unnecessary. The author's frustration is valid here because trust and respect are foundational in a relationship. If she can't trust him after he's been clear, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad at her lack of trust. He's right to feel that he shouldn't have to defend his sexuality repeatedly. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through his porn history, are invasive and not respectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
