Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He says he's been asked about his sexuality before because he gives off a vibe that makes people think he's gay. He doesn't mind telling people he's straight, but his girlfriend keeps questioning him, even checking his porn history. He gets annoyed because he feels he should be taken at his word, especially since he's comfortable with his sexuality and it's 2019, so he thinks this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend might have her reasons for doubting him. Maybe she's insecure because he was nervous during sex initially, or she's been influenced by her friend. But repeatedly questioning him and invading his privacy by checking his porn history is problematic. The author is frustrated because he's honest about his sexuality, and her not trusting him could lead to issues in their relationship.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, if someone is being honest and direct, the other person should respect that unless there's a valid reason to doubt. The girlfriend's actions suggest a lack of trust. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about being mistrusted, especially when he's already addressed it multiple times. However, his frustration might come off as dismissive of her feelings if she's struggling with her own insecurities or understanding of his behavior. \n\nBut the key points are: the author is clear about his sexuality, he's been upfront, and the girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasion of privacy are the issues. The author isn't the one in the wrong here because he's standing up for his right to be trusted and not have his sexuality questioned after stating it clearly. The girlfriend's actions are more concerning in terms of trust and respect.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
