Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times in his life but doesn't mind answering. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, started doubting his sexuality after he had some initial performance issues during sex. She even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly, even though he's already stated he's straight. He's upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his word at face value.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior seems to stem from insecurity or lack of trust. The author's frustration is valid because he's being asked to justify his identity, which can be exhausting. However, the girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and could be seen as a breach of trust. That's a red flag in any relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings are reasonable; being made to defend one's identity is not healthy. The girlfriend's actions are overstepping and not respecting his boundaries. The author is in a position where his trust is being undermined, which is a valid reason to be upset. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's reacting to her behavior, which is the problem here. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasion of privacy are the main issues. The author isn't at fault for being annoyed by her actions. So, the answer should be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
