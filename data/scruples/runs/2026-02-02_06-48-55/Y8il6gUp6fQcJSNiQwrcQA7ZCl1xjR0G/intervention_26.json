Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their girlfriend for repeatedly asking if they're gay. The author is straight, in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend started questioning his sexuality after he had some initial performance issues during sex, which she discussed with a friend. Now, the author is upset because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and that his girlfriend isn't taking his answer seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being asked repeatedly despite clearly stating he's straight, which is frustrating. He feels disrespected and thinks it's hypocritical, especially since his girlfriend is bisexual and should be more accepting. On the other hand, the girlfriend's concern might stem from her own insecurities or lack of trust, possibly influenced by her friend. Her actions, like checking his porn history, might be overstepping, but her questioning could also be a sign of not fully trusting his openness.\n\nKey points: The author is a self-identified straight man, the girlfriend is bisexual. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be based on her friend's suggestion after he had initial sexual performance issues. The author feels disrespected, which is valid. However, is the author in the wrong for being angry? Or is the girlfriend's behavior the issue?\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being asked repeatedly about one's sexuality, especially when it's clearly stated, can be irritating and disrespectful. However, the girlfriend might have concerns she hasn't communicated effectively. Maybe she has trust issues or is grappling with her own insecurities. The fact that she looked through his porn history is a privacy violation, which is definitely problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate. The author is justified in feeling that his sexuality is being questioned unnecessarily and that his trust is being undermined. The girlfriend's actions are invasive and disrespectful, so her behavior is questionable. \n\nHowever, the author's response\u2014getting mad\u2014might be a valid reaction to feeling disrespected. The key is whether the author's anger is justified given the circumstances. If the girlfriend is not respecting his boundaries and is acting out of distrust, then the author's frustration is warranted. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author is in the wrong for his anger. Since the girlfriend's actions are the main issue (questioning repeatedly, invading privacy), the author's anger is a reaction to her behavior, not the root problem. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The real issue is the girlfriend's lack of trust and overstepping, so the author's anger is valid. Hence, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
