Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a straight guy in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She got the idea he's gay because he was nervous during sex at the beginning. He told her he's straight, but she keeps questioning him, even checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially in 2019, and he thinks it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girlfriend's repeated questioning despite the author's clear statements about his sexuality. The author feels it's unnecessary and disrespectful. He's upset at her and her friend for not taking his word.\n\nNow, considering consent and respect in relationships. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If someone repeatedly questions their partner's sexuality without believing them, that could be a sign of insecurity or lack of trust. The author has the right to feel upset if his honesty is doubted. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend has her reasons. Maybe she's insecure about his attraction to women, given that she's bisexual. Or she might feel her friend suggested it and she's trying to address her own doubts. But even so, after multiple affirmations from the author, continuing to question and invade privacy (checking porn history) isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid. Constant questioning can be hurtful. It's okay to be upset if someone doesn't take you at your word, especially when it's repeated. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity, but the way she's handling it is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling angry about being doubted. The girlfriend needs to work on trusting him, and the friend who influenced her should respect the couple's privacy. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
