Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He mentions that people often ask him if he's gay, which he doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend has started questioning his sexuality multiple times, even checking his porn history. He got annoyed because he feels he's being forced to defend his heterosexuality, especially since his girlfriend is bi and should be more understanding. He argues that in 2019, being made to feel like he can't be trusted when stating his sexuality is outdated.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, maybe her initial concerns come from her own experiences or insecurities. Bisexual people can sometimes have fears of being labeled or have trust issues. However, repeatedly questioning her partner's sexuality, especially after he's affirmed it, might be crossing a line. The fact that she shared the issue with a friend and then that friend reinforced her doubts could indicate a lack of trust. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because being made to question one's identity or being forced to prove it can be hurtful. Especially in a trusting relationship, if one partner isn't respecting the other's stated identity, that's a problem. The girlfriend's actions\u2014asking repeatedly and invading privacy by checking his porn history\u2014are concerning. Trust and respect are key in any relationship, and if one partner isn't respecting the other's boundaries or statements, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, the author's response is anger. While his feelings are justified, he might need to consider why she's doing this. Is there a deeper issue, like her own insecurities or past experiences? He could address the underlying cause instead of just being mad. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since she's not respecting his boundaries and his identity, he's not the one at fault. The real issue lies with the girlfriend's behavior and lack of trust. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
