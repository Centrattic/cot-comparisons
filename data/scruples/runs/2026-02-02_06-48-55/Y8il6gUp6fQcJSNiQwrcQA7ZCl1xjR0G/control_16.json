Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he's a heterosexual male dating a bisexual girlfriend. She's been asking him if he's gay multiple times, even after he told her he's straight. He got annoyed and is now mad at her and her friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since he's in a relationship with her. He gives examples of others not questioning his sexuality, and he's frustrated by the constant doubt. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be struggling with trust or insecurity. Maybe she's been in past relationships where someone's sexuality was a red flag, or perhaps she's just trying to understand his orientation better because of her own bisexuality.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. If the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality even after he's confirmed it, that could indicate a lack of trust. But why is she doing that? The user mentioned that she told her friend about the nervousness during sex, and the friend suggested he might be gay. That seems like the friend's assumption based on a single incident, which might not be valid. The girlfriend might be influenced by that friend's opinion, but shouldn't she trust her partner's own statement?\n\nAlso, the author is frustrated because if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. That's his own reasoning, but everyone's comfort levels are different. However, since he's stated he's straight multiple times, the girlfriend should respect that unless there's actual evidence to the contrary, which there isn't here. The fact that she checked his porn history is a big deal because that's an invasion of privacy. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and checking someone's private information without consent is a breach of that.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable because being asked repeatedly in a relationship where he's already confirmed his orientation can be exhausting and hurtful. It's about being respected and not having to defend his identity. The girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or the friend's input, but that doesn't justify not taking him at his word.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He has the right to be respected in his self-identification. The girlfriend and her friend's actions are the problematic ones here. The author's frustration is valid because he's not the one who should have to constantly prove his sexuality. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
