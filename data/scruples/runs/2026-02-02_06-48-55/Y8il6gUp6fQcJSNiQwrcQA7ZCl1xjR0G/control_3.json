Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He says he's been asked before, doesn't mind, but now she's questioning him again and even checked his porn history. He feels frustrated because he's stated he's straight, and he doesn't understand why she's not taking him at his word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend got the idea from someone else, maybe a friend, because he was nervous during sex. That's a common concern, maybe related to performance anxiety rather than sexuality. But she's not taking his reassurance, which is leading to repeated questioning. The author feels it's hypocritical because he's not given the benefit of the doubt, unlike LGBTQ+ people who might face similar issues. But does that apply here?\n\nThe key points are: the author is straight, she's questioning his sexuality despite his claims. The author is upset because he's being made to defend his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions (checking porn history) could be seen as invasive. The author's frustration is valid because it's about trust and respect. But does that make him \"in the wrong\"?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is insecure or has trust issues. But if he's already stated he's straight, repeatedly questioning him without taking it as a given could be problematic. However, the girlfriend's actions are intrusive, which could be an issue. The author's anger is about being treated as if he's lying or hiding something. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If one partner doesn't trust the other's sexuality after they've stated it clearly, that's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being questioned again and again. The girlfriend's actions cross boundaries (checking porn history), which is a breach of privacy. The author's frustration is about being made to justify his sexuality when he's given a direct answer. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
