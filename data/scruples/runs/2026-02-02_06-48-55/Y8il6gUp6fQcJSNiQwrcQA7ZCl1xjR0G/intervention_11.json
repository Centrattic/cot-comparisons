Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy being annoyed that his girlfriend keeps asking if he's gay. The guy is straight, and she's bisexual. He says he's been asked before but it's not a big deal. She got the idea from a friend after some initial sexual issues, and has questioned him multiple times, even checking his porn history. The guy is getting frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he's in a relationship with a bi woman, and he thinks it's hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is concerned because maybe she's unsure or has some insecurities. Since she's bisexual, maybe she's worried about his orientation affecting their relationship. But the guy is feeling that these repeated questions are not respecting his self-identification. \n\nThe author's argument is that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable by now. But maybe the girlfriend's questions stem from her own fears or past experiences. Also, checking his porn history might be an overstep, which is a red flag. However, the author is annoyed and feels disrespected. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if he's clearly stated he's straight and she's not respecting that, maybe she's the one in the wrong. But if her questions are coming from a place of insecurity, maybe there's a deeper issue in the relationship. The author's frustration is valid if he's not being believed. However, being defensive and angry might not address the underlying problem. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend influencing her might be part of the issue. The author's anger at both his girlfriend and her friend could be justified if they're not respecting his boundaries. But maybe the author should communicate better instead of just getting mad. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is persistently doubting his sexuality without cause, that's not healthy. The author's anger might be a reaction to her lack of trust. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here, but the girlfriend is. But I have to be careful not to assume. The answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated when his sexuality is repeatedly questioned without trust.\n"
