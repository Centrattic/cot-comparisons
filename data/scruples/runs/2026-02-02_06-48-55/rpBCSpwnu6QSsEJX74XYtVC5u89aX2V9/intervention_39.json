Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex because both are young, in university, and not in a place to have a child.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, and the girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. The girl is on the pill but missed doses during vacation, leading to pregnancy. The boyfriend is upset because he believed the pill was over 99% effective and feels she should have taken more responsibility. He's not ready for a child and can't support it financially. He tells her if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. The girlfriend did take the pill, but missed doses, which is a known risk. However, the boyfriend didn't use a backup method, which is also his responsibility. By not using condoms, he might have assumed the pill was 100% effective, which it's not. So he's partly at fault for not discussing alternative methods.\n\nThe key point is his ultimatum. He's saying she must abort to stay together. That's putting pressure on her to make a decision that's deeply personal and her own. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate the pregnancy. His approach is controlling and doesn't respect her autonomy. The girlfriend should have the right to decide what's best for her, even if it's different from his wishes.\n\nHe also admits to feeling angry that she didn't tell him about the risk of missing pills. But part of being in a relationship is communication. If she was struggling with the pill, she should have talked to him about it. However, he also didn't check in with her about her pill usage or suggest using condoms as a backup. Both have shared responsibility here.\n\nHis ultimatum is problematic because it's not just about him not being ready; it's about his refusal to consider other possibilities, like adoption or supporting the child. By cutting off the relationship if she chooses to keep the baby, he's not showing support or willingness to work through the issue together. That's a major red flag for the wrong reasons in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while both have made mistakes in contraceptive responsibility, his ultimatum and pressure on the abortion are where he's in the wrong. He's not respecting her autonomy and is using the relationship as a lever to influence her decision, which is ethically wrong.\n"
