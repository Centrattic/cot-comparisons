Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (18m) asking his girlfriend (20f) to have an abortion. They've been dating seven months, and she got pregnant while on the pill. He's 18, she's 20, and both are in university.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is taking a stance on her decision to have an abortion. He feels she didn't handle contraception properly and is holding that against her. He's saying that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her because he's not ready. But he's also saying he'll support her financially if she chooses to be a single mom. \n\nThe key points to analyze are: \n1. Contraception responsibility: Even though she's on the pill, both partners should have discussed and confirmed that she's taking it correctly. The author assumed she was taking it properly, but she mentioned she's been off her normal schedule. He didn't check in or discuss backup methods. So maybe he shares some responsibility for not ensuring contraception.\n2. Communication: She didn't tell him about her irregular pill use, which is a problem. But he didn't ask her about her routine either. Both might have failed in communication here.\n3. Pressure for abortion: The author is pressuring her to abort, which is a huge decision. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision should be mutual. By making it conditional on her aborting, he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she's open to keeping the baby and he's not considering her wishes might be problematic.\n4. Emotional impact: He's aware that this decision will affect their relationship, but he's pushing her to make a choice that's not fully hers. He's putting her in a position where she has to choose between losing him or the child, which is emotionally coercive.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while both might share some responsibility for the pregnancy (like not using backup methods), the author's approach to resolving it by pressuring an abortion could be seen as wrong. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is typically considered the woman's right, and pressuring her to make that choice unilaterally is not supportive. The author is not offering to take responsibility for the child if she keeps it, instead making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That's a significant issue.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, they're both young and might not be ready, but the author's decision to tie his commitment to her terminating the pregnancy seems unfair. He should be considering her wishes more and perhaps taking on more responsibility if she chooses to keep the child, rather than withdrawing support. His stance could be seen as abdicating responsibility and placing the entire burden on her. So, while there are elements of shared responsibility, the way he's handling the situation is likely where he's in the wrong.\n"
