Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, the girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses. He feels she should have used a backup method, like condoms, or told him not to have sex. He's not financially stable, living with his parents, and has an apprenticeship. She's a university student with student loans in student housing. He's not ready for a child and wants her to abort, giving her money if she doesn't. She's open to keeping the baby but doesn't commit.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to see if he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, does he have the right to make that decision for her? Abortion is a personal choice, and typically, the woman has the right to decide. He's putting pressure on her to terminate the pregnancy, which is a major decision. Even though he's concerned about their situation, the decision to have an abortion isn't just his to make. He's also placing the responsibility on her for not taking the pill correctly, which might not be entirely her fault. Stress from university could affect pill adherence. Also, he's not offering support if she wants to keep the baby, instead ultimatums. That could be seen as selfish. However, his position is that he's not ready and can't support a child, which is understandable. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave unless she aborts\u2014seems harsh and possibly controlling. So, I think he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a unilateral decision. The answer would be A.\n"
