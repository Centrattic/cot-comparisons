Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complicated because both are young and in a university setting, so they're not in a stable position to have a child. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she didn't take it properly. The author feels she should have communicated better and not had sex without backup protection. Now, he's saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby, which is making her choose between the baby and their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both partners in a relationship regarding contraception. Both should be on the same page about protection. The author might not be entirely wrong in thinking she should have taken more responsibility with the pill, but it's also true that he didn't use a condom or another method, so he might share some responsibility too. However, the main issue here is the author's ultimatum. Telling her that she must have an abortion to keep the relationship could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's considering keeping the baby. \n\nAbortion decisions are deeply personal and should be the woman's choice. The author's response might be seen as inconsiderate because he's making the decision for her, not allowing her to make her own choice. Even if he's not ready for a child, forcing her to terminate the pregnancy could be seen as selfish or controlling. The fact that he's offering to help financially if she goes solo is a bit contradictory, but the ultimatum is the problem. \n\nAlso, the author is 18 and still in an apprenticeship, which means he's very young and maybe not in a position to make such a decision for someone else. The girlfriend is 20 and older, so legally she's an adult, and her autonomy should be respected. The author's argument that he's not at fault because she didn't take the pill properly might hold some weight, but pushing her to have an abortion to save the relationship is where he's in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The girlfriend is upset, and the author is making her feel like the problem is entirely hers. Even if she made a mistake, the relationship should support each other. By making her choose between him and the baby, he's not being supportive. The right approach would be discussing options together, including adoption or support if she keeps the baby, rather than forcing an abortion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not considering her autonomy and is pressuring her into a decision that's not his to make. That makes him wrong in this situation. The answer should be A.\n"
