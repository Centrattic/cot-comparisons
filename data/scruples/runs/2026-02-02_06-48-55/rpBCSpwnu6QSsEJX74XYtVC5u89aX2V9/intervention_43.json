Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked their girlfriend to have an abortion is in the wrong. The situation is that the girl is 20, the guy 18, both in university, and they're not in a position to have a child. The girl was on the pill but missed some doses because of her vacation schedule. The guy is upset she didn't use backup and now is pressuring her for an abortion, saying he can't handle a child and won't stay with her if she has the baby.\n\nFirst, considering the legal aspects: In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right. The man doesn't have the authority to force her to terminate the pregnancy. Even if they're in a relationship, the choice is hers. The guy's ultimatum that she must abort to stay with him is problematic because it's pressuring her to make a medical decision that's not his to control.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is complex. The girl might feel manipulated if he's using their relationship as a leverage. She's already in a vulnerable position and might feel like she has to choose between the baby and the man. The guy is also young and not financially stable, so he's not in a good position to support a child, but that's on both of them. However, the key issue here is the lack of mutual decision-making. Contraception is a shared responsibility, but the girl didn't communicate her missed pills, which is a red flag. The guy didn't check in about her pill usage either, so he's not entirely blameless there either.\n\nBut the main point is the abortion ultimatum. By putting the decision solely on her to abort or lose him, he's not supporting her in making an informed choice. He's making her carry the burden of the decision without considering her feelings or her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, he's not in a position to dictate her medical decisions. So, even though the girl may have some responsibility in the contraception, the guy's approach is ethically wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the girl is open to keeping the baby but doesn't express her true feelings. The guy's response might push her towards an abortion she doesn't fully want, just to keep him. This could lead to long-term resentment or regret on her part. The guy is also not taking responsibility for the situation; instead of discussing solutions together, he's using it as a way to end the relationship if she doesn't comply.\n\nIn terms of relationship health, ultimatums like this create a toxic dynamic. It's important for both partners to be on the same page when facing such a life-changing decision. The guy's actions here show a lack of empathy and partnership. He's not treating her as an equal in this situation but instead making her the sole decision-maker with high stakes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though both might share some fault in the contraception oversight, the guy is in the wrong for pressuring her for an abortion and using their relationship as a bargaining chip. The decision to have an abortion is hers alone, and he shouldn't be controlling that choice. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
