Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a girl is pregnant, and the guy is pressuring her to have an abortion. He's saying that he's not ready for a baby, they can't afford it, and he doesn't want to lose her but can't be involved with a child. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should be on the same page about contraception. The girl was on the pill, but she missed some days because of her schedule. The guy thought the pill was 99% effective, but he didn't use a backup method. So, maybe he shared some responsibility here. The girl didn't inform him about her inconsistent pill use, which could be a problem, but maybe the guy should have discussed using another method just in case.\n\nNow, the main issue is the pressure to abort. The guy is saying that if she doesn't abort, they can't stay together. That seems really unfair because the decision to have an abortion should be the woman's choice. He's making it a deal-breaker, which could be seen as coercive. Even though he loves the baby, he's not considering her feelings and autonomy. The girl is in a tough position here\u2014she's being forced to choose between her relationship and her future as a single mother, which is a huge decision with major consequences.\n\nThe guy is also acting like it's entirely her fault for missing the pills. But in a relationship, both partners should take responsibility for contraception. He didn't check in with her about how she was taking the pill, and he didn't use a backup method. So, his attitude that it's her fault might not be fair. \n\nMoreover, the timing of their lives\u2014both in university, not financially stable\u2014makes this situation even more complex. But pressuring her to abort without her consent is a big ethical issue. The right to make decisions about one's own body is a key factor here. The guy is trying to impose his decision on her, which is a problem because it's her body and her future.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 18 and not in a position to be a parent. His feelings about not being ready are valid, but the way he's handling it by forcing the decision on her isn't. The article mentions that the girl is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. Making her feel like she has to abort to keep the relationship is not supportive. A healthy relationship would involve working through challenges together, not splitting up over a decision that's beyond their control.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is in the wrong because he's pressuring her for an abortion and not taking shared responsibility. He's also making it a condition for staying in the relationship, which is coercive and disregards her autonomy.\n"
