Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked their girlfriend to have an abortion is in the wrong. The situation involves an unplanned pregnancy where the girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses. The man feels she should have been responsible and not gotten pregnant, leading him to pressure her for an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both partners have a say in decisions about pregnancy, but the woman has the legal right to make the final decision. The man is putting a condition on staying in the relationship unless she aborts the baby. That seems coercive because it's pressuring her to make a choice that's ultimately hers to make. \n\nThen there's the issue of shared responsibility. The couple wasn't using backup protection, but the man assumes the woman should have taken the pill properly. However, the woman might have valid reasons for missing doses, like stress or changes in routine. He's placing the blame solely on her, which might not be fair. Both partners should have discussed the use of additional contraception, especially if there were concerns about missed pills.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is complex. The man is scared about his future and the woman's feelings are hurt. His ultimatum\u2014either abortion or ending the relationship\u2014could be seen as manipulative. It doesn't respect her autonomy in the decision. Even if he's not ready for a child, forcing her to choose between her relationship and her pregnancy is a heavy burden.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. They might not have discussed contraception properly, leading to this situation. The man's anger and ultimatum might stem from his own fear, but it's not healthy to make decisions for her. The woman's openness to keeping the baby, even if uncertain, shows she's considering her options, and the man's response doesn't allow for a collaborative approach.\n\nIn summary, while both might share some responsibility, the man's ultimatum and placing blame without considering her autonomy and feelings make it seem like he's in the wrong. The key points are coercion, lack of shared decision-making, and not respecting her agency in the situation.\n"
