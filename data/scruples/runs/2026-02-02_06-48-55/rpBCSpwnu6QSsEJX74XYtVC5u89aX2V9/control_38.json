Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, and they've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and the guy is 18. Both are in university, so their financial situations are tight. He's on an apprenticeship with a small wage and lives at home. She's on student loans in student housing. They don't have the resources to support a child.\n\nThe girl was on the pill but wasn't taking it properly because of her schedule during university vacation. The guy felt she should have used a backup method or told him they needed to stop having sex. When she told him about the pregnancy, he was shocked and later told her he couldn't stay with her if she wanted to keep the baby. He's essentially giving her an ultimatum: abortion or lose him. \n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and autonomy. The guy is taking a stance that it's the girl's fault for not handling contraception properly. But in reality, even if she was responsible, there are no 100% effective methods except abstinence. The pill is 99% effective, but that still leaves a small chance. So maybe the guy's anger is misplaced here. He should have been more proactive in using a backup method, like condoms, regardless of her pill use. The fact that he didn't suggests he shares some responsibility.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect of pressuring someone into an abortion. The girl is considering keeping the baby, but the guy is making it clear that he can't be part of a life with a child. By offering financial support if she becomes a single parent but insisting she has to abort to stay with him, he's not respecting her autonomy. This is a heavy decision, and he's adding pressure by making it a condition for their relationship. \n\nAlso, their age and life stages are important. At 18 and 20, they're young and still figuring out their futures. The emotional impact on both is significant. The guy is conflicted but feels he's not ready, which is valid, but using that as a reason to force the girl into an abortion crosses a line. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should be hers alone, not a condition for maintaining the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is placing a lot of responsibility on the girl but isn't taking his own share. His ultimatum is unethical and possibly manipulative. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
