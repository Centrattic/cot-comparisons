Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, the guy is 18, and they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but didn't take it properly. He feels she should have told him they needed condoms or to stop having sex. He's asking her to abort the baby, saying he can't handle being a parent and they can't afford it. She's open to keeping the baby but he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort.\n\nHmm. From the start, the guy is blaming her for not taking the pill correctly. Even though the pill is 99% effective, it's not 100%, and relying solely on it without backup is risky. But he expected her to take it properly, which she didn't. However, as a partner, shouldn't he also be sharing the responsibility? Maybe he's not taking accountability here. He's not using a condom, which is his part of the responsibility too. So he's placing all the blame on her, which might not be fair.\n\nHe's also putting her in a position where she has to choose between abortion or losing him. That's a huge pressure. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision isn't just his to make. The pregnancy is hers, and she has the right to make her own choice. By making it conditional on her aborting the pregnancy, he's taking away her autonomy. That's a major issue.\n\nHe mentions that he loves her and the baby but can't handle the situation. But his solution is to force her to abort or leave. That seems very controlling. Partners should support each other in such decisions, not make ultimatums that remove the other person's agency. Even if he's not ready, he's imposing his choice on her, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, they might not be ready, but that's a reality for many young couples. However, the way he's handling it by pressuring her for an abortion is problematic. He's not offering support for her to keep the baby if that's what she wants. Instead, he's cutting himself off from her unless she complies. That's not a healthy or fair approach.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the key points are the lack of shared responsibility in contraception, placing all blame on her, and pressuring her to make a decision that affects her own body. So, yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
