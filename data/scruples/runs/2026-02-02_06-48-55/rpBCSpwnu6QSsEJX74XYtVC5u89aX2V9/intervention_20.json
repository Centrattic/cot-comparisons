Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admitted she wasn't taking it properly during university vacation. He feels she should have used backup contraception or told him they needed to stop having sex, which led to the pregnancy.\n\nHe's now asking her to have an abortion, and if she wants to keep the baby, he says he can't stay with her. He offers financial support if she chooses to be a single mom. He's conflicted but feels it's not his fault she didn't handle the contraception properly.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he's not ready for a child, they can't afford it, and he's upset she didn't use protection correctly. But from her side, she's on the pill, which is her primary method, and maybe she didn't expect to fail. The fact that she's on vacation and her schedule is off might affect her pill intake. Also, the responsibility of contraception isn't entirely on her\u2014both partners should discuss and possibly use backup methods.\n\nHe's making a big decision that affects her body and future without fully considering her wishes. Even though she said she's open to keeping the baby, he's pressuring her to abort and threatening to leave if she doesn't. That seems controlling and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAbortion is a personal decision, and he's not the one who has to go through it. By making her choice about her body dependent on his willingness to stay in the relationship, he's putting her in a difficult position. It's possible he's acting out of fear and inexperience, but that doesn't excuse the lack of support and respect for her agency.\n\nSo, while he has valid concerns about their readiness for a child, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave unless she aborts\u2014puts him in the wrong. The key issue here is respecting her autonomy and shared responsibility in decisions that affect both their lives. His approach seems more about his own unpreparedness rather than a mature, supportive discussion.\n"
