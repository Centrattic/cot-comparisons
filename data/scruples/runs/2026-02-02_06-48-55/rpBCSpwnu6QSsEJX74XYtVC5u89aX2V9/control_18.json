Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple in university, both not in a position to have a child. The girl got pregnant while on the pill, but she wasn't taking it properly. The guy found out and asked her to have an abortion, otherwise he can't stay with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So if the guy is pressuring her to have an abortion against her wishes, that's a problem. But in this case, the girl says she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't confirm her own stance. The guy is making a decision that affects her body and her future, which is a big issue. Even if he's not forcing her, putting conditions on the relationship based on her reproductive choices could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the guy is placing blame on her for not managing contraception properly. While she did have a responsibility, he could have checked in more about her pill usage or used backup methods. He might be shifting responsibility instead of taking joint accountability. The fact that he's not ready for a child is his own issue, but he's making her decision about the pregnancy contingent on their relationship, which is problematic. Relationships shouldn't be based on ultimatums about reproductive choices, especially when it's a shared responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young, in an apprenticeship, and they both have limited resources. His concerns about being unprepared are valid. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to end the relationship unless she aborts\u2014could be seen as controlling. The girl's autonomy is key here. Even if she's open to abortion, the pressure from him might affect her decision. So, the main issue is that he's not respecting her agency in the situation. He's making her decision about her own body tied to their relationship, which is ethically wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n"
