Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple is young, both in their early 20s. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is 99% effective, but she didn't take it properly because her schedule changed during vacation. The author feels she should have used a backup method or told him they needed to stop having sex. Then when she gets pregnant, he's shocked and not ready, and he tells her he doesn't want the baby and that if she wants to stay with him, she has to abort.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that since the pregnancy resulted from her not managing contraception properly, he's not responsible and doesn't want to be part of having a child right now. He's also considering his financial situation and their ability to care for a baby. However, the girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, which complicates things.\n\nNow, thinking about responsibility in relationships. Both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if one is on the pill, it's not 100% effective, and relying solely on it without a backup method could be seen as a shared responsibility. The author might feel that she didn't take the pill correctly, but maybe he could have suggested using condoms as a backup. Did he take any responsibility for discussing contraception?\n\nAlso, the author is making a decision about the pregnancy, which is a major life choice. Even though the child would be his, it's her body, and the decision to have an abortion should be hers. By making her an ultimatum\u2014either abort or he leaves\u2014he's putting pressure on her decision. That could be problematic because he's not considering her autonomy and emotional state. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, the right to bodily autonomy is a key point. The woman has the right to decide what happens with her body, even if the pregnancy resulted from a mistake. The author is trying to impose his decision on her, which might be seen as wrong. \n\nAdditionally, the author is young and not in a financial position to support a child, but that's a common argument. However, the fact that he's pressuring her to abort rather than considering other options (like being a parent) might not be fair. He's also showing a lack of communication about their future and expectations. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel betrayed because she trusted him and didn't tell him about the pill issues, possibly because she didn't want to cause conflict. But she did tell him, and then he reacted with anger and ultimatums. That could have been handled more compassionately.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in a difficult situation, but by making his girlfriend choose between losing the baby or losing him, he's not respecting her autonomy and is placing the burden solely on her. That seems to be in the wrong. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers to make, and he shouldn't use their relationship as a condition for her choice.\n"
