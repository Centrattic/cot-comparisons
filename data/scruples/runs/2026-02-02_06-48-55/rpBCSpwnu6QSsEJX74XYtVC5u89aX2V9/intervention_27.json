Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old man whose 20-year-old girlfriend is pregnant. He's asking if he's wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she missed doses because her schedule was off during university vacation. The author feels she should have communicated better, maybe using backup protection or stopping sex. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby and says he can't stay with her if she doesn't abort, which upsets her a lot.\n\nNow, thinking about responsibility. Both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even though she's on the pill, the author didn't use a condom or other backup. So maybe he shares some blame for not using protection. However, she was on the pill, which is her method, but she didn't take it properly. The author might feel she was negligent, but is that fair?\n\nThe author's response is to make a ultimatum: either abort or lose him. That's a heavy decision to put on her. Even if he's not ready for a child, pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes (since she mentioned being open to keeping it) is a big deal. It's her body, and her choice. The author is making her decision for her, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, they both are young and not in a position to have a baby. But that doesn't mean he can dictate the choice. It's important to respect her autonomy. The author's approach seems to be placing the blame entirely on her, not considering that contraception is a shared responsibility. Plus, he's not offering to support her if she chooses to keep the baby, which might add pressure for her to abort.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's ultimatum is controlling. It's not his decision to make about her pregnancy. Even if he's not ready, he can't force her to abort. The situation is complex, but the key issue here is his lack of support and the ultimatum, which makes him partly at fault. So the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
