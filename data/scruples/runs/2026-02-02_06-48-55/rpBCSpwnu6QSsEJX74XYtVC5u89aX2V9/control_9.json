Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, and the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion or else he'll leave her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses because of her schedule. The guy felt she should have used backup contraception or communicated better. He's not ready for a child and is pressuring her to abort, offering financial support if she chooses to be a single mom. \n\nLegally, in many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. So, if she wants to keep the baby, he can't force her. The guy's ultimatum\u2014either abort or he leaves\u2014could be seen as coercive. Even though he's not happy about the pregnancy, he's using their relationship as leverage. That's a big red flag. Relationships should be built on mutual support, not conditional ultimatums based on life-changing decisions.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend is upset. She's considering her options, but he's not supporting her. He's placing blame on her for not handling contraception properly. That's unfair because both partners share responsibility for contraception. The fact that he's angry she didn't use backup protection when she missed pills shows a lack of understanding. He expected her to take the pill perfectly, but human error happens. It's a shared responsibility; maybe they should have used condoms regardless of the pill.\n\nFinancial and situational factors are real. They both are young, in school, and not in a position to support a child. But that doesn't justify pressuring her to abort. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is deeply personal and should be hers to make. His ultimatum takes away her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, he can't force her to abort. If she chooses to keep the baby, he's walking away, which is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nAlso, the guy's reasoning that it's her fault for not handling contraception properly is problematic. Both should have discussed and agreed on backup methods. He might feel betrayed, but his response is to end the relationship rather than support her. That's not healthy in a partnership. A healthy relationship would involve discussing options and supporting each other's decisions, even if they're difficult.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to abort, using their relationship as leverage, and placing blame on her without taking shared responsibility. His actions are coercive and undermine her autonomy. The answer should be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
