Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy due to contraceptive failure. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, his girlfriend 20, both in university. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, which is effective but not 100%. He expected her to take it properly and didn't use backup. She admitted she wasn't taking it consistently during vacation. \n\nHe feels shocked and tricked because she didn't mention the risk. Now, he's not ready for a child, can't support one, and is pressuring her to abort. He's told her that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her. She's open to keeping the baby but might be uncertain.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Contraception is a shared responsibility. Even though she's on the pill, maybe he should have used a condom as backup. He's placing blame on her for not managing contraception, but maybe he's also responsible. \n\nThe key issue is his ultimatum: abortion or breaking up. That's a huge pressure. Even if he's not ready, forcing her to abort could be seen as controlling. Her right to make decisions about her own body is important. If he's not willing to support her choice to keep the baby, maybe he shouldn't be in the relationship. However, his financial and emotional situation is real.\n\nBut in relationships, both partners share responsibility. He's not wrong for not wanting a child, but the way he's handling it\u2014giving her an ultimatum\u2014might be the problem. He's making a decision for her, which isn't fair. So, even if his reasoning has some validity, his approach is wrong. Hence, he's in the wrong.\n"
