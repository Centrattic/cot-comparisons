Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're both young, in university. She's pregnant, and he's not ready for a child. He's an apprentice with a small wage, living at home. She's on student loans. They don't have financial stability. She was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. He feels she should have used backup or told him they needed to stop sex. He then asks her to abort, saying he can't handle a baby and that if she wants the baby, she can't stay with him.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The key points here are autonomy, responsibility, and communication. \n\nShe was on the pill, which he thought was reliable, but she missed doses. He might feel she was responsible in a way, but birth control is never 100% guaranteed. However, he's placing blame on her for not using backup methods. But is that fair? She might have thought the pill was enough, and he didn't insist on other methods. So maybe both share some responsibility.\n\nThen, when she tells him about the pregnancy, his reaction is to push for abortion. He's not ready, which is understandable given their age and financial situation. But is it his decision to make? The woman has the right to make her own reproductive choices. By pressuring her to abort, he's taking away her agency. Even if he's not ready, the decision shouldn't be his to force. \n\nHe's using financial arguments\u2014saying they can't support a child. But that's a common factor for many young parents. Also, he's saying he's not willing to be part of the child's life if she keeps it, which could be seen as abandoning responsibility. Even if he's not present, he's financially responsible in many jurisdictions. But he's offering to give her what he can afford, which might not be enough.\n\nHe's also making a decision that affects her body and her future. That's a big ethical issue. The right to choose is fundamental here. Even if he believes abortion is wrong, he's pressuring her to do it. But in this case, he's the one suggesting it, not her. However, he's not forcing her, just telling her he can't stay with her if she doesn't. So it's a form of coercion through emotional pressure.\n\nAnother angle: the girl is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. He's putting pressure on her to choose abortion to maintain the relationship. That could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over her autonomy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe he should have been more proactive in ensuring protection. He might not have considered that the pill could fail, even with her best efforts. So part of the issue is that he's placing blame on her for the failure, when sometimes even proper use can fail.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision about her own body under the guise of not being ready, without considering her autonomy and her right to make that choice independently. Even if he's not ready, he can't decide for her. The fact that he's using the relationship as a condition for the abortion is coercive and disrespectful of her agency. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
