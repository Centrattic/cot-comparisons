Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The author is a 18-year-old guy who's been dating his girlfriend for seven months. She's on the pill but didn't take it properly during her vacation, leading to pregnancy. The guy is upset and feels she didn't communicate the risk, leading him to ask for an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is still young, in an apprenticeship, and not financially stable. He's not ready for a child, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the girl is 20, in university, and she's responsible for her own contraception. She admitted she didn't take the pill properly, which is her responsibility. But she might have thought she was protected, and maybe she didn't think it through. \n\nThe key issue here is communication. The girl didn't inform him about her irregular pill usage, which is a big part of the problem. However, the guy is now pressuring her to have an abortion. Even though he loves the baby to some extent, he's making a decision for her. The girl's autonomy is important here. She should have the right to decide what happens with her body. The guy is in a position where he's not ready, but he's not the one carrying the child. \n\nAnother point is that he's telling her she can't stay with him unless she aborts. That's a significant ultimatum. It's possible he feels cornered and is reacting out of fear, but it's a heavy burden to place on her. The girl might be in emotional distress, and his ultimatum could be seen as manipulative or not considering her feelings and choices.\n\nAlso, the guy is 18, which is a young age to be making such a life-altering decision. He might not have fully considered the emotional impact on both of them. The fact that he's offering financial support if she wants to be a single mom is a bit of a gesture, but the main issue is the ultimatum. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have shared some. The girl didn't manage her contraception properly, and the guy didn't use backup methods. But the decision about the pregnancy is hers to make. The guy's approach might be more about his own inability to handle the situation rather than considering her rights. \n\nSo, even though the guy is dealing with his own stress, the way he's handling it by giving her an ultimatum could be seen as wrong. He's not respecting her autonomy in the decision. The right approach would be to support her in making the choice she feels is best, whether it's abortion or continuing the pregnancy, even if he has his own preferences. By making it conditional on staying with him, he's not supporting her fully. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion and not respecting her agency.\n"
