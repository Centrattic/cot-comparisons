Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, the author is 18, and they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which they assumed was effective. The author feels she didn't manage her contraception properly, especially since she was off her normal schedule during university vacation. He argues she should have used a backup method or stopped having sex. \n\nHe then tells her he can't have a child right now due to financial and personal reasons and gives her an ultimatum: abort or he can't stay with her. She's upset, and he's torn between his feelings and the reality of their situation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and societal perspectives. The key points here are autonomy and shared responsibility. The pregnancy is a joint result of their sexual activity. While the pill is effective, it's not 100% foolproof, and human error (like missing pills) can happen. The author didn't use backup protection either, so part of the responsibility lies with him. \n\nBy not using condoms, he might have assumed the pill was sufficient, but that's a shared decision. The girlfriend might have thought the pill was enough, but she admitted to missing doses. Both contributed to the situation.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is problematic. Pressuring her to have an abortion, especially when she's open to keeping the baby, goes against her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, the decision shouldn't be solely his. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to keep the baby shows some responsibility, but the ultimatum itself is coercive. \n\nAlso, their ages and financial situations are relevant. Both are young and not in a stable position for a child. However, the pregnancy is a reality, and the decision should be mutual. The author is placing the burden on her, which isn't fair. He's not taking responsibility for his part in not using backup protection and is making a decision that affects her body and future. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the woman's right to choose is central. The author isn't considering her wishes fully and is making a decision that could end her relationship. Even though he's not ready, the pregnancy isn't solely her fault. The pressure to abort without her full consent is where he's wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that affects her body, not taking shared responsibility, and making an ultimatum that's not fair. The answer should be A.\n"
