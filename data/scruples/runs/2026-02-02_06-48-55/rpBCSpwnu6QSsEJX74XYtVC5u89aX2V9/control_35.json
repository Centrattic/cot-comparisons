Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is an 18-year-old guy in a seven-month relationship with his 20-year-old girlfriend. She's pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion. He mentions she was on the pill, but she wasn't taking it properly because of her schedule during university vacation. He felt she should have mentioned the risk and used backup protection. Now, he's telling her he can't stay with her if she has the baby, so she needs to abort. \n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points here. Both are in their early 20s, students, and not financially stable. They're not prepared for a child. The woman was on the pill but missed doses. The author feels she should have communicated the risk, and now he's giving her an ultimatum. \n\nI need to check if this is an ethical or moral issue. Legally, in most places, both partners have a say in the decision, but the woman has the final say on her body. Ethically, is it right for him to pressure her into an abortion? Well, he's not forcing her, but he's saying he won't stay with her if she doesn't have one. That could be seen as emotional pressure. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's open to keeping the baby but he's not considering her wishes is a problem. He's making the decision about their future based on his readiness, not hers. Even if he's not ready, the decision to continue the pregnancy is hers. By linking his stay in the relationship to her choice, he's controlling her autonomy. \n\nHe also mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him about missing the pill. But both were relying on the pill as the primary method. It's possible he could have used a condom as a backup, which is a shared responsibility. So maybe he's also at fault for not using additional protection. \n\nThe emotional impact on her is significant. He's causing her distress by setting this ultimatum. Even if he feels it's the right decision for them, pressuring her in this way is unfair. The key here is respecting her autonomy and considering her feelings and choices. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is pressuring his partner to have an abortion to maintain the relationship, which infringes on her autonomy. He's not considering her potential desire to keep the child despite the challenges, and he's making decisions that affect her body. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
