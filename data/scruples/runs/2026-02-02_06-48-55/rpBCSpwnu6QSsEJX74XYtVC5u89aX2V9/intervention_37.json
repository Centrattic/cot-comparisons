Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that an 18-year-old guy is asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion after she becomes pregnant. They've been dating for seven months, and she was on the pill but missed some doses during her university vacation. The guy is upset because he thought the pill was over 99% effective and expected her to take it properly without backup. He feels she didn't communicate the risk and now he's not ready for a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The guy is pressuring her to have the abortion, which could be problematic because it's her body and her choice. Even if he's not ready, the decision shouldn't be his to make. He's also choosing to end the relationship if she goes through with the pregnancy, which is a big decision and might be seen as putting pressure on her.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is 20, so she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The guy is 18, same age, but maybe less mature. He's in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and they both have limited financial resources. However, that's their situation, but it's not a reason for him to dictate her medical decisions. He's framing it as her fault for missing pills, but the pill's effectiveness can be affected by various factors, including missed doses. The fact that she was on vacation and off her normal schedule might be a valid reason for missing doses, which he dismisses. That could be a point where he's not considering her circumstances.\n\nHe didn't use backup protection, and he expected her to handle the contraception properly. But in a relationship, both partners should communicate about their contraceptive methods. It's not just the woman's responsibility. If he was relying on the pill, he could have also suggested using condoms as a backup. By not doing so, he shares some responsibility. However, he's now placing blame on her for the pregnancy.\n\nThe key issue here is the abortion decision. The guy is essentially saying he can't be part of her decision to keep the baby and is threatening to leave the relationship if she doesn't abort. That's a form of coercion, which is unethical. The pregnant person has the right to decide what to do with their body. The guy is also emotional about it, feeling like an asshole, but still proceeding. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion, not respecting her autonomy, and not taking shared responsibility for the situation. Even if his motivations are based on not being ready for parenthood, the decision to abort should be hers alone. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
