Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author, an 18-year-old guy, is in a seven-month relationship with his girlfriend, who is 20. She's pregnant, and he's suggesting she get an abortion. His reasoning is that neither of them is in a position to have a baby, especially since he's still living with his parents and has an apprenticeship, and she's on student loans. He also feels she didn't properly take her birth control, and he's upset that she didn't inform him about the risks or use backup protection.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. So if the author is pressuring her to have an abortion against her will, that could be problematic. The question is whether his actions cross into being in the wrong.\n\nHe mentions she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't specify if she wants to or not. He then tells her he can't stay with her if she wants the baby and offers to support her financially only if she chooses single motherhood. This seems like he's making the decision for her, which is a big deal. Even if he's not forcing her to have the abortion, he's effectively saying that the only way their relationship can continue is if she aborts the baby. That puts a lot of pressure on her and might be manipulative.\n\nHe also blames her for the situation because she didn't take the pill properly. However, it's important to note that both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if she was on the pill, which is over 99% effective when used correctly, no method is 100% foolproof. So maybe his blame is misplaced. Also, he didn't use backup protection, which could have been an additional precaution.\n\nHe's in a difficult position emotionally, feeling shocked and not ready for parenthood. But his response of ending the relationship unless she aborts seems extreme. He's putting the burden on her to make a life-altering decision, and he's not considering her wishes or well-being as much as his own. The emotional manipulation here is significant because he's using the pregnancy to control the relationship's future.\n\nAnother angle is their ages. Both are young, and the situation is stressful for both. However, the key issue is whether the author is respecting his girlfriend's autonomy. If she wants to keep the baby, he should support her, even if it means the relationship ends. By giving her an ultimatum, he's not respecting her autonomy and is instead making the decision for her, which is a key factor in determining if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision that affects her body and future without supporting her choice. He's not taking responsibility for his role in the situation and is instead placing blame on her, which isn't fair. The fact that he's using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship unless she aborts shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and his own lack of maturity in handling the situation.\n"
