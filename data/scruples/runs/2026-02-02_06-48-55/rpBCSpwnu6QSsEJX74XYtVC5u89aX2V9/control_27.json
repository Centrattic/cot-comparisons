Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, and the boyfriend is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is 20, the boyfriend is 18. They've been dating for seven months. She was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. He found out she's pregnant and immediately wants her to have an abortion, even saying he can't stay with her if she doesn't. He's not taking responsibility for using backup contraception and is placing the blame entirely on her for not taking the pill properly. \n\nThe main issue here is about shared responsibility in contraception. While the pill is effective when used correctly, it's not 100%, and the boyfriend didn't use any backup method. He might be right that she should have informed him about missing doses, but he also didn't check in or offer alternative methods. The fact that he's not offering support for her to keep the baby and is instead pressuring her for an abortion could be problematic. \n\nAbortion is a personal decision that the pregnant person should make. By pressuring her to abort and threatening to end the relationship, the boyfriend is not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy. His approach is controlling and doesn't consider her wishes or well-being. \n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, they're both young and not in a stable position for a child. However, the way he's handling it\u2014placing blame and ultimatums\u2014shows a lack of empathy and support. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, so his response is dismissive of her potential desires. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, both partners share the responsibility of contraception. The boyfriend could have suggested using condoms as a backup, and the girlfriend should have communicated her missed doses. However, the boyfriend's reaction is to place all the blame on her and force an abortion, which is not fair. \n\nAdditionally, pressuring someone into an abortion is a serious issue. It's her body and her decision. The boyfriend's ultimatum is manipulative and doesn't respect her autonomy. Even if he's scared, he should be supportive of her decision, whether to keep the baby or not, rather than making it a condition for staying in the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not taking shared responsibility, is pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion, and is not respecting her autonomy in the decision-making process.\n"
