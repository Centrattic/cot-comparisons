Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is young, both in university, and not financially stable. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is 99% effective, but she missed doses during vacation. The author feels she should have used a backup method or communicated better, leading to the pregnancy.\n\nThe author then demands an abortion, not wanting to be part of a single-parent scenario. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't made a decision. The author is putting pressure on her, making it a condition to stay in the relationship. \n\nLegally, in many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author is essentially pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready, imposing his decision on her, especially when she's considering other options, seems problematic. \n\nAlso, the initial argument about contraception: while the girlfriend might have been responsible for her pill, both partners should discuss and agree on birth control methods. The author didn't check in on how she was taking the pill or offer backup methods. So maybe part of the fault is on both sides, but the main issue here is the author's ultimatum.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is using the relationship as leverage. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision to abort should be hers. His approach is manipulative and doesn't consider her rights or feelings.\n"
