Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who asked the question is in the wrong. The situation is about him asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me read through the details again.\n\nHe's 18, she's 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill. He thought the pill was over 99% effective, so he didn't use backup. She said she's been missing pills because of her university vacation schedule. He's upset she didn't tell him they were at risk, implying she should have used condoms or stopped sex. Now he's telling her that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her, so she must abort, or else he'll leave and maybe help financially.\n\nHmm. First, I think about consent and shared decision-making in such a big decision. An abortion is a medical procedure that the woman undergoes, and it's her body. The man can't force her to have one, but he's essentially saying that if she doesn't abort, he'll leave. That puts pressure on her. Even if he's not forcing her physically, emotionally pressuring her might be wrong.\n\nHe's also placing blame on her for not taking the pill properly. But both partners are responsible for contraception. Even though she's on the pill, he could have used a condom as backup. He expected her to take full responsibility, but maybe he should have considered that things can go wrong, and that it's a shared responsibility. He didn't check in with her about whether she was taking the pill consistently, perhaps?\n\nHe's not in a position to support a child financially, living with his parents and having an apprenticeship. But he's putting the decision entirely on her, which is a big burden. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers. Making her choose between the baby and the relationship is a tough spot for her, especially since she mentioned she's open to keeping the baby but isn't sure. He's limiting her options by not being supportive of either path.\n\nAlso, he's 18, which is young, and maybe he's not fully understanding the emotional weight of his demands. Even though he loves her, the ultimatum seems harsh. It's possible he's being selfish, prioritizing his own readiness over her potential desire to have the child. But he's also in a vulnerable position, financially and emotionally.\n\nI think the key points here are about shared responsibility in contraception, the pressure to have an abortion, and the lack of support from him if she chooses to keep the baby. Since the decision to have an abortion should ultimately be hers, pressuring her like that is wrong. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
