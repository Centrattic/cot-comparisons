Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who asked about the abortion is in the wrong. The scenario involves a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, both in university, and they're not in a position to have a child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the girl is 20, she's an adult, and in many places, she can make her own medical decisions, including an abortion. The guy can't force her to have one or not have one. But here, he's asking her to have an abortion, which is a request, not a demand. However, he's also saying that he can't stay with her if she doesn't. That seems problematic because he's using their relationship as a condition based on her medical decision.\n\nHe's upset that she didn't use the pill properly, which is a common issue with birth control methods. He expected her to take it correctly, but she admitted she wasn't on her normal schedule. He feels tricked because she didn't mention the risk. But is it fair for him to feel that way? Both partners are responsible for contraception, and while the pill is effective, it's not foolproof. He might have been aware of that, but maybe he didn't consider the possibility of human error.\n\nHe's in a position where he's not ready for a child, which is understandable given their age, financial situation, and living arrangements. He's also considering the future of their relationship. However, pressuring her to abort, even if he's not prepared for parenthood, might be seen as selfish. The decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers, and he's trying to dictate it based on his own readiness. That could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nHe also mentions that he's willing to support her financially if she wants to be a single mom, but only if she aborts to stay with him. That's a complex situation. He's acknowledging her right to make a choice but tying their relationship to that decision. That might be where the ethical issue lies. The girl's right to choose should be independent of the man's relationship desires.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 18 and in an apprenticeship, so his resources are limited. He's not in a position to support a child, which is a valid concern. But he's also young and in a relationship that's only seven months old. The emotional impact of this situation on both of them is significant. He's conflicted, loving the baby but not the circumstances.\n\nLegally, unless there's a law compelling her to have an abortion, he can't force her. Ethically, he's in a tough spot because he's making a request that affects her body and her future. However, the fact that he's offering support if she chooses to keep the baby shows some responsibility. But his ultimatum about the relationship might be the key point here. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and support, not conditional on such a personal decision.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the autonomy of the individual to make decisions about their own body is paramount. So, by pressuring her to abort, he's infringing on her autonomy. However, given their situation, his stance is not without merit. He's not the one who will be carrying the child, so the immediate burden of the pregnancy and childbirth falls on her. He might feel the decision is hers to make, but he's trying to influence it based on their shared circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's respecting her choice but expressing his own stance, that's one thing. But if he's pressuring her or making the relationship contingent on her decision, that's another. The way he's framing it, he's not just expressing his preference; he's setting a condition for their relationship. That seems to be where the ethical issue lies. So, while his concerns are valid, his approach might be inconsiderate of her autonomy and the pressure he's placing on her.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy by making the relationship conditional on her decision, even though his concerns about readiness are understandable.\n"
