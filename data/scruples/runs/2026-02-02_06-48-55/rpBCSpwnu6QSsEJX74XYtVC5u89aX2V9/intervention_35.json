Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AMA is in the wrong. The situation is that the 18-year-old guy is asking his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion because she got pregnant while on the pill, and he's not ready to be a parent. He's blaming her for not taking the pill properly and not using backup contraception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy is young, in an apprenticeship, and living at home. He's not in a position to support a child. His main argument is that she should have been more responsible with the pill and communicated better. But the girl is also young, in university, and on vacation, which might have disrupted her pill schedule. She didn't tell him about the missed pills, which is a point he's emphasizing.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if she missed pills, they were having unprotected sex. Both parties are engaging in sexual activity with the expectation that contraception is being used. The guy is now shifting the responsibility entirely onto her, but realistically, both should have considered backup methods. Also, the pill's effectiveness relies on consistent use, which requires mutual awareness and responsibility. Maybe they both should have discussed their birth control methods more openly.\n\nThe guy's ultimatum\u2014either abort the baby or he'll leave her\u2014is a huge pressure move. It's not just about his readiness but also about controlling her reproductive choices. The question is whether he has the right to make that decision for her. Even if he's not ready, the pregnancy is hers, and she's the one who would carry it. His stance seems to disregard her autonomy. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. He's making her choose between her relationship and her pregnancy, which is a significant burden. Even if he's not in a position to support a child, forcing her to abort takes away her agency. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to have the baby shows some responsibility, but the ultimatum is problematic.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right in many places, so pressuring her that way could be seen as wrong. Also, the fact that he's using her supposed negligence as a reason to end the relationship is harsh. Both made decisions that led to the pregnancy, and the blame isn't solely on her.\n\nIn summary, while the situation is complex, the author's approach of pressuring her for an abortion and threatening to leave if she doesn't comply seems to place the responsibility unfairly and infringe on her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
