Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, the guy is 18, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, but she admits she wasn't taking it consistently because of her university vacation. The guy feels she should have communicated better, maybe used a backup method, and now he's not ready for a child. He's in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and they both have financial issues. He tells her he can't stay with her if she wants to keep the baby and gives her an ultimatum: abortion or he leaves. She's upset, and he feels conflicted but sticks to his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the person carrying the pregnancy, which is the woman. The man doesn't have the legal right to make that decision for her. By pressuring her or giving her an ultimatum, he's essentially trying to control her bodily autonomy. That's a key point. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't impose his choice on her. \n\nHowever, there's context here. They're both young, in university, and financially unstable. He's expressing his own limitations and fears. But does that justify his ultimatum? Maybe not. He could be supporting her in making a choice that's right for her, even if it means the relationship ends. Making her feel like it's her fault because she didn't take the pill properly might be another factor. He should take some responsibility for not using backup methods, even though he thought the pill was reliable. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. He's conflicted, loves her, but also can't handle the situation. But his ultimatum is about forcing her to choose between losing the baby or losing him. That puts pressure on her and doesn't respect her autonomy. Even if he's in a tough spot, the choice isn't his to make. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while his situation is complicated, the main issue is that he's pressuring her to have an abortion, which is her decision. The fact that he's giving her an ultimatum, instead of supporting her in whatever choice she makes, suggests that he's in the wrong. He's not taking into account her autonomy and is making a decision that affects her body. Even if they both aren't ready for a child, the decision to terminate is hers. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
