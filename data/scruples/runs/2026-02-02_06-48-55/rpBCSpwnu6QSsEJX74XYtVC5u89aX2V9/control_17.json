Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the young man is 18 and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She gets pregnant while on the pill, and he's upset because she didn't use backup protection. He's now pressuring her to have an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, abortion rights vary, but the key here is that the decision to have an abortion is typically up to the pregnant person. The author is a male and not the one carrying the child, so legally, he shouldn't have a say in that decision. Ethically, it's a big issue because the woman has the right to make her own reproductive choices.\n\nThen there's the matter of responsibility. The woman was on the pill, which isn't 100% effective, as the author acknowledges. He expected her to take it properly, but when she didn't, he didn't suggest using condoms. That's a problem because both should share responsibility for contraception. His reaction seems to place the blame solely on her, which isn't fair. He's not taking responsibility for not using additional protection either.\n\nHe also mentions that he's not ready for a child and that they can't afford it. While those are valid concerns, it's not his choice to make regarding the pregnancy. Pressuring her to abort because of his readiness is putting his own needs above hers. The woman has her own autonomy and should have the final say on what happens to her body.\n\nThe fight they had where he threatened to leave if she doesn't abort is really problematic. It's controlling and manipulative. He's essentially telling her she has to choose between the baby and their relationship, which is unfair. Their financial situation is tough, but that's not an excuse for him to pressure her. \n\nEmotionally, he's conflicted but still insists on his position. Even though he loves her and the baby, he's not considering her feelings and her right to make that decision. The core issue here is about respecting her autonomy versus his desire to avoid responsibility. \n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion, not taking shared responsibility for the situation, and not respecting her autonomy. The right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy lies with the pregnant individual, and his actions don't support her in making that decision on her own terms.\n"
