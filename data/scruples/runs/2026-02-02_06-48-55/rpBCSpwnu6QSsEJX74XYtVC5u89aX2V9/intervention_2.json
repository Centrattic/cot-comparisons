Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves an 18-year-old man whose girlfriend, 20, is pregnant. He's pressuring her to have an abortion, which causes a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The fact that the author is trying to pressure her into it might be a problem because it's her body and her choice. Even if he's not ready for a child, he doesn't have the right to make that decision for her.\n\nNext, the contraception issue. The girlfriend was on the pill but didn't take it properly. The author might feel she was responsible for the pregnancy, but both partners have a role in contraception. He didn't use a backup method like condoms, so he shares some responsibility. However, the main responsibility for the pregnancy lies with her since she wasn't taking her pill correctly. But that doesn't excuse him from being considerate in how he approaches the situation.\n\nThe emotional impact is significant. The author is in denial about his part in the situation and is putting pressure on his girlfriend. He's using the fact that she didn't take her pill correctly as a reason to not take responsibility. By telling her she has to choose between the baby and him, he's forcing her into a difficult decision. This is emotionally manipulative and could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his own readiness over her autonomy and well-being.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, both are young and may not be equipped to handle a child. However, the decision to abort should be hers alone. The author's approach is controlling and doesn't respect her agency. Even if he's scared, he should support her in making the choice that's best for her, not dictate it.\n\nIn summary, while the situation is complex and both might share some responsibility for the pregnancy, the author's actions in pressuring her for an abortion without considering her autonomy are ethically problematic. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
