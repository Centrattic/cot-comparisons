Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their ages and the context. Both are young, in university, with limited financial resources. She was on the pill, but he says she wasn't taking it properly because of her vacation and schedule. He feels she should have used a backup method like condoms. She didn't tell him, so he feels tricked. Then he tells her he wants an abortion and threatens to leave if she doesn't have it, even though he loves her and the baby.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are responsibility for contraception. In a relationship, both partners usually share responsibility. Even if she was on the pill, they could have both made sure to use protection. She admits she wasn't taking the pill properly, which he sees as her fault. But is it fair for him to put the burden entirely on her? He didn't use a backup method either. So maybe he's not entirely without fault.\n\nBut then, when she tells him she's pregnant, he's upset and makes a decision without considering her feelings. He says he won't stay with her if she chooses to keep the baby. That seems really harsh. He's putting pressure on her to terminate the pregnancy, which is a major decision. Even if he's not ready, it's her body and her choice. He's not being supportive but instead giving ultimatums. That can't be healthy for the relationship or her well-being.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's 18 and she's 20, they're both young and in a vulnerable position. The idea that she's not ready to be a mom is valid, but it's not her alone's decision. He's not ready to be a parent either, but he's making her carry the burden of the choice. It's possible that he's not handling the situation maturely, and maybe he's being selfish by not considering her feelings and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's in an apprenticeship, living with parents, and she's on student loans. Financial instability is a real issue. But should that mean the decision is forced on her? No. Both of them should have been responsible, but he's now taking a controlling stance. He's not offering support or alternatives, just ultimatums. That's a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to have an abortion and not taking shared responsibility. Even if there's some fault on her side for not using the pill properly, his response is not constructive. He's not being supportive, and he's making a major life decision for her. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
