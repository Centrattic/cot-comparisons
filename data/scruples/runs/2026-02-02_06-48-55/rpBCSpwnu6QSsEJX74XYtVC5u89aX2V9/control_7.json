Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a 18-year-old guy in a 7-month relationship with his 20-year-old girlfriend. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because she didn't use backup protection and didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly during her vacation. He's not ready for a baby, can't afford it, and feels it's her fault for not handling contraception. He's asking her to have an abortion, threatening to leave if she doesn't, and is considering financial support if she wants to be a single mom.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The author is pressuring his girlfriend to terminate the pregnancy, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if he's not the one carrying the baby, her right to make decisions about her own body is a key factor here. Forcing or strongly influencing someone else's medical decisions, especially life-altering ones like abortion, is generally considered unethical.\n\nNext, the situation regarding contraception. Both partners should be responsible for contraception. The fact that she was on the pill but not taking it properly is a valid issue, but the author could have suggested using additional protection like condoms. The question is whether he was negligent by not using backup methods. He thought the pill was over 99% effective, which is correct in general, but no method is 100% effective. However, if he relied solely on the pill without checking if she was taking it consistently, maybe he shared some responsibility. But it's also true that it's her responsibility to take the pill as prescribed.\n\nThe author's response to the pregnancy is where the main issue lies. Pressuring her to abort and threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't is problematic. It shows a lack of support for her, regardless of the decision she makes. Healthy relationships require mutual support, especially in difficult situations. By making her choice dependent on whether she aborts the pregnancy, he's not respecting her autonomy and is creating a hostile environment.\n\nMoreover, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant. She's open to keeping the baby but is being pushed towards an abortion. The author is placing the burden of the decision entirely on her, without considering her feelings and circumstances. This could lead to resentment and emotional harm.\n\nAnother angle is the age and maturity of both individuals. At 18 and 20, they're both young and dealing with university, which is a time of significant life changes. They might not be equipped to handle the responsibilities of parenthood, but that doesn't justify pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy. The decision should be hers, not his.\n\nAlso, considering the financial and practical aspects, the author is right that they can't support a child right now. But that's another reason why they need to make a joint decision that considers both their situations. Instead of forcing her to abort, he should be discussing all options together, including adoption or parental support, and being supportive of whichever choice she makes.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about being unprepared for parenthood, his approach of pressuring his girlfriend to terminate the pregnancy and threatening to leave the relationship is ethically wrong. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is her right, and he should respect that. His actions are controlling and disregard her autonomy, which is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
