Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nFirst, both are young, 18 and 20, in university, and not in a position to have a child financially. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she missed taking it regularly, leading to pregnancy. The author is upset because he didn't expect this and feels the responsibility is on her. He then tells her he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby, essentially making it a condition of their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a healthy relationship, both partners should have mutual respect and support. The author is making a decision that affects both of them, but more importantly, he's putting pressure on his girlfriend to have an abortion, which is a significant medical decision. Even though he loves her and the baby, he's essentially saying that if she wants to keep the baby, they have to break up. That feels coercive. \n\nContraception is a shared responsibility. While the girlfriend did miss her pill, the author didn't check in or suggest alternative methods like condoms. He assumed she was taking the pill properly. However, the fact that he didn't use a backup method might also be a point. But even so, when they found out about the pregnancy, the author's response was to cut off the relationship unless she aborts. That's not supportive. \n\nThe girlfriend is considering keeping the baby, which shows she's thinking about her own choice, but the author is not supporting that choice. He's making her feel like it's her fault and that he can't handle it, which could make her feel pressured. Even if he's not ready, the decision to abort is hers, and he shouldn't be forcing her into it by threatening the relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, the author is in a position where he's making a choice that's not in line with respecting his partner's autonomy. He should be discussing options together, not ultimatums. So, even if he feels it's not his fault, the way he's handling it is wrong. He's not taking responsibility for the situation and is instead blaming her, which is unfair. The right approach would be to support her in making the decision that's best for her, even if it means the relationship ends. Making it a condition to stay in the relationship by having an abortion is manipulative and puts undue pressure on her.\n\nSo, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
