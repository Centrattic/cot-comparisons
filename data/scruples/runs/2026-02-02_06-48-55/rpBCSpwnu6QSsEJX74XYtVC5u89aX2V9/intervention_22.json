Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see... The situation is about a young couple, both in university, and the girl got pregnant. The guy is 18, she's 20. They've been dating seven months. The girl was on the pill but stopped taking it properly during her vacation, not on a normal schedule. The guy found out she's pregnant and wants her to have an abortion, giving her an ultimatum: abort the baby or he can't stay with her. He's not ready for a kid, they can't afford it, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both partners are supposed to be responsible about contraception. The girl was on the pill, which is effective if taken correctly. But she missed taking it, which is her responsibility. However, the guy didn't use a backup method, so maybe he shares some responsibility too. The question is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nHe's saying she didn't tell him she was at risk, which is a problem. But he also didn't mention the need for backup. So both could be at fault. The guy's ultimatum is a big deal. He's putting pressure on her to abort the baby, which is a major decision. Even if he's not ready, forcing her to make that choice against her will (or maybe she's open to keeping it) could be wrong. He's saying it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception properly, but he did trust she was taking the pill correctly. Maybe he's being too harsh here. Also, he's young and not in a position to have a child, but that's his problem, not hers. The girl wants to keep the baby, but the guy is making it a deal-breaker. That might be selfish. The fact that he's giving her an ultimatum is a big issue. Even if he's not ready, he can't force her to abort. She has her own rights and choices here. So the author is being inconsiderate of her autonomy. \n\nBut maybe there's a point where both are at fault. However, the key here is that the guy is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which is a significant decision, and he's not allowing her to make her own choice. Even if he's not ready, it's her body. So he's in the wrong for making her choose between the baby and him. The way he frames it as her fault and gives her an ultimatum is problematic. So answer A.\n"
