Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old guy who's been dating his girlfriend, a 20-year-old university student, for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He feels she didn't take the pill properly during her vacation from uni and didn't communicate the risk. Now, he's pressuring her to have an abortion if she wants to stay with him, otherwise he'll leave. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether it's right for the author to force his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let's start with the effectiveness of the pill. Contraceptives like the pill require consistent use. If she missed doses during her vacation, that could reduce its effectiveness. But is that an excuse? Maybe not in his eyes, but the fact remains that both partners share responsibility for contraception. He didn't use a backup method, so he might be partially at fault for not considering that possibility.\n\nNext, communication. The girlfriend admitted she knew the risks but didn't mention the pill issues. However, the author also didn't check in or discuss their birth control methods. When she told him about the pregnancy, he was shocked but didn't immediately address his anger. Instead, he waited a few days and then gave her an ultimatum. That seems harsh. Pressuring her to have an abortion because of his own readiness is a big problem. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should be hers alone, not something he can demand as a condition for staying in the relationship.\n\nHe mentioned being in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and their financial situations. Both are young and in a tough spot, but that doesn't justify putting the burden on her. Coercing a woman into an abortion is ethically wrong and can have serious emotional consequences. Even if he's not ready for a child, he shouldn't force the decision on her. He should support her in whatever choice she makes, whether it's abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby.\n\nThe author also said he's willing to give her \"whatever he can afford\" if she chooses to be a single mom. While he might have good intentions, this approach also places the emotional and physical burden entirely on her. He's also worried about the relationship being impacted regardless of her choice, which shows a lack of commitment to being a partner through the challenges.\n\nIn many places, the woman has the legal right to decide about her own body. Ethically, it's about respecting her autonomy. Pressuring her to make a decision that affects her health and future is a big issue. The fact that he's not ready isn't a valid reason to make her have an abortion. Relationships require mutual support and shared responsibility, not ultimatums based on one person's fears.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not taking responsibility for his part in the situation. He's blaming the girlfriend without considering that both are responsible for contraception. His ultimatum is a form of emotional coercion and doesn't respect her autonomy. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
