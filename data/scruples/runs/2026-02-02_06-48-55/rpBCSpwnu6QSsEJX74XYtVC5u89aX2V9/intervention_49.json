Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, he's 18. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's shocked because she was on the pill. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him she wasn't taking the pill properly. He's not ready for a baby, can't support it financially, and is pressuring her to abort or else he'll leave. She's open to keeping the baby but he's telling her it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception right.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he's young, in an apprenticeship, living at home. A baby would be a huge burden. He's not the one who's pregnant, so maybe he's not in the same position to carry the child. But on the other hand, he's making a decision that affects her body and her life. Abortion is a personal medical decision, and he's imposing his choice on her. Even though they were both involved in the sexual relationship, the responsibility here might be on him to take accountability. He could have suggested other forms of birth control or used a condom. Also, he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort, which could be seen as coercive. The fact that he's using financial arguments (they can't afford a baby) might not be entirely fair, as they can't control the situation now. \n\nHe feels she didn't communicate her pill schedule, but she mentioned she wasn't on her normal schedule during vacation. Maybe she didn't realize the risk enough to mention it. He could have been more proactive in ensuring they used protection if she wasn't on the pill consistently. Also, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, and he shouldn't unilaterally decide that for her. Even if they were both responsible for contraception, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be hers. His ultimatum seems harsh, especially given their age and inexperience. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is putting pressure on his girlfriend to make a decision that's not his to make. He's not taking full responsibility for the situation and is using it as a reason to end the relationship if she doesn't comply. That seems unfair. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
