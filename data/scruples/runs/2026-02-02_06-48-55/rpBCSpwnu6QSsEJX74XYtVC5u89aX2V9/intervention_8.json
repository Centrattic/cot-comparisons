Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple where the girlfriend becomes pregnant, and the guy asks her to have an abortion. The guy is 18, she's 20, both in university, not in a position to have a child. He's upset because she wasn't on the pill properly and didn't use backup. He felt tricked because she didn't tell him about the risk. He then tells her he can't stay with her if she has the baby and forces her to abort or else he'll leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is the pressure on the woman to terminate the pregnancy. Even if both are young and not ready, the decision about abortion should be hers to make. The guy is essentially saying he won't be part of a relationship if she keeps the baby, which puts all the pressure on her. That's a big red flag. He's not taking responsibility for the situation; instead, he's blaming her for not using contraception correctly. However, even if she made a mistake, it's not her fault entirely. They were both involved in the relationship and should have communicated better about contraception. \n\nHe's also not offering support for keeping the baby. If she wants to keep it, he's not considering that option seriously. Instead, he's giving her an ultimatum. That's not supportive. The fact that he mentions he can't afford a child is a valid concern, but using that as a reason to force her to abort is problematic. He's not showing empathy for her feelings or her situation. She's 20, also a student, and might not have the financial means either. He's putting her in a position where she has to choose between her relationship and her own decision about her body.\n\nAnother point is that he didn't address the communication issues. He should have talked to her about contraception, maybe used condoms even if she was on the pill. Relying solely on the pill without backup isn't the safest approach. He's now blaming her for the pregnancy, but both have responsibilities in ensuring safe sex. The fact that he's angry she didn't tell him they were at risk shows a lack of communication from both sides.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is about autonomy and shared responsibility. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, and the man shouldn't be pressuring her. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't make that decision for her. The fact that he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort is controlling and undermines her agency. \n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, in many places, the woman has the legal right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The man's insistence on an abortion without her full willingness is not acceptable. He's not considering her feelings or her potential desire to keep the baby. He's making it a personal choice for himself rather than a mutual decision. \n\nSo considering all these points, the author is putting pressure on the woman to terminate the pregnancy and not supporting her in other options. That makes him at least partially responsible for the situation, even if the pregnancy wasn't planned. The way he's handling the decision is disrespectful and lacks consideration for her autonomy and their relationship.\n"
