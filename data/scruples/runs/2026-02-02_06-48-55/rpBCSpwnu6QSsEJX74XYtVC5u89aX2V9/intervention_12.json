Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves an 18-year-old guy and his 20-year-old girlfriend who got pregnant while she was on the pill. He's upset because she didn't use back-up protection and didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly. Now he's pressuring her to abort the baby or else leave the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is a minor, which might affect his maturity level. He's in an apprenticeship and has financial limitations. The girlfriend is 20, which is an adult age, so she's legally an adult. The main issue is whether it's right for him to pressure her into an abortion. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author argues that they can't support a child financially and that the pregnancy was due to his girlfriend's oversight with the pill. However, the girlfriend is the one who is pregnant and would be the one undergoing the abortion. Her autonomy is a key factor here. The author is essentially making a demand on her body, which is a heavy ethical burden. \n\nAlso, the author didn't set up any boundaries or back-up protection. He trusted the pill's effectiveness without ensuring she was taking it. While the pill is 99% effective, that's not 100%, so maybe he shares some responsibility. However, he might not have known she wasn't taking it properly. But he also didn't check in with her about it or use condoms, which could be a shared responsibility in contraception.\n\nThe author's ultimatum\u2014abortion or breakup\u2014puts her in a difficult position. Even if they aren't ready, the decision to have an abortion should be hers, not something he's imposing. He's using their relationship as a leverage point, which is manipulative. The emotional impact on her is significant, and he's causing her distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is young and unprepared for parenthood. He might feel overwhelmed and think this is the only solution. But the ethical question is about his actions towards her. Pressuring someone into an abortion is typically considered a form of coercion, especially if it's a non-negotiable demand. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend might have her own feelings about the pregnancy. The author acknowledges she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't know her true feelings. He's making a decision that affects her body and future without her full input, which is a violation of her autonomy. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, bodily autonomy is a fundamental right. By pressuring her to abort, the author is not respecting her right to make that decision. Even if the pregnancy wasn't planned, the choice should be hers. The author's approach is seen as controlling and not considering her wishes, which is why the user says he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion to fit his life circumstances, without respecting her autonomy and potentially using their relationship as leverage.\n"
