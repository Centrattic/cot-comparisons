Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the guy in the situation) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is young, both in university, with limited financial resources. The girl is on the pill but missed doses during her vacation, leading to a pregnancy. The guy feels she didn't communicate properly about her pill use and the risks. He then asks her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready and can't support a child, and that if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent, communication, and shared responsibility. The guy is asking her to terminate a pregnancy, which is a major life decision. However, the pregnancy is a result of their sexual relationship. Both share responsibility for contraception. The girl did mention she was on the pill, which he trusted to be effective, but she admitted missing doses. \n\nThe guy's reaction is to put the burden on her. Even though he's not ready, he's forcing the decision on her. But in a relationship, both partners should have a mutual discussion about such a significant issue. The guy is taking a stance that it's her fault for not handling the contraception properly, but he didn't check in on her pill use or suggest alternative methods. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is complex. The guy's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her into an abortion, which is a major medical decision. Even if he's not ready, he's suggesting that her responsibility is to abort rather than considering if they can find another solution together, like adoption or support. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's willing to provide financial support if she's a single mom but insists on the abortion if she wants to stay together might indicate he's not fully considering her autonomy. The pregnancy is hers to carry, and the decision should be hers to make, even if it affects their relationship. \n\nHowever, his financial and emotional unpreparedness is valid. But the way he's handling it by ultimatum could be seen as wrong because it's pressuring her into a decision that's not solely hers. The responsibility isn't entirely on her, even if she missed pills. \n\nIn summary, while the situation is complex, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his decision on her without considering her autonomy and shared responsibility. He should have discussed all options together rather than giving an ultimatum.\n"
