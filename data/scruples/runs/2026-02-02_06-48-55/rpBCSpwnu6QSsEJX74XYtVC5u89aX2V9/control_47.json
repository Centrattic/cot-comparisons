Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, and they've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He felt she should have been on top of her schedule, especially since she's in university. She admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because of her vacation schedule. He's now saying she should have told him they needed to use condoms or stop having sex when she stopped taking the pill properly. Then he tells her he doesn't want the baby and that if she wants to stay with him, she has to abort the pregnancy. He's conflicted but insists he's not ready for a child.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. First, the legal aspect: in many places, the decision to have an abortion isn't solely up to the partner. The woman has the right to make that decision. So by pressuring her to have an abortion, he might be violating her autonomy. Even if he feels responsible, he can't force her choice.\n\nThen there's the issue of responsibility. Both partners have a role in contraception. While she was on the pill, which he thought was reliable, he might not have considered that it's also her responsibility to take it correctly. However, maybe he should have used a backup method just in case. The fact that he didn't consider that could be a point against him.\n\nEmotionally, he's under a lot of stress, but his approach seems to be placing blame on her, which isn't helpful. Communication is key in such situations, and he might have handled it poorly by making ultimatums. Also, he's suggesting he can't stay with her if she has the baby, which could be seen as abandoning her, adding to the pressure.\n\nAnother angle is that he's underage (18) and she's 20, which might affect their ability to handle a child. They're both in a position where they can't support a child financially or emotionally. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the feasibility of having a child.\n\nHe did express that he loves the baby but can't support it, which shows some empathy. However, the ultimatum he gave her is a significant problem. It's not his decision to make, and he's not taking her feelings into account, even though she's open to keeping the baby. She might have her own reasons for considering it, and he's not respecting her agency.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main issues are his lack of support, the ultimatum, and not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, he shouldn't be making the decision for her. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
