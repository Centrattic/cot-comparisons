Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18M) asking his girlfriend (20F) to have an abortion after she becomes pregnant while on the pill.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is over 99% effective when used correctly. The author assumes she was taking it properly, but she admits she missed doses during university vacation. Now, the author is pressuring her to have an abortion because he's not ready for a child and they both can't support a baby. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this is tricky. The girlfriend's responsibility in taking her pill correctly is important, but the author also has a role in contraception. Even if she's on the pill, it's a shared responsibility. The author didn't use backup methods like condoms, which might be a point of contention. He's now making a decision that affects her body and autonomy. \n\nAbortion is a personal medical choice, and the girlfriend should have the final say. The author's ultimatum\u2014either abort or he leaves\u2014could be seen as coercive. He's prioritizing his own readiness and financial situation over her wishes and rights. Even if he's not ready, it's not his decision alone to make. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional state is mentioned. She's upset and says she doesn't want to lose him. The author's response might be causing her emotional distress, which is a red flag. The fact that he's willing to offer financial support if she chooses to be a single mom but demands an abortion to stay in the relationship seems to place the burden on her. \n\nLegally and ethically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The author's insistence on an abortion could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if there are financial concerns, those are factors she might consider, not him dictating the choice. \n\nHe also mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him she might be at risk. But the pill's effectiveness relies on her consistency, which she's had trouble with. However, expecting her to communicate every potential issue without prompting might be unrealistic. It's a shared responsibility to discuss and ensure that both are on the same page regarding contraception. \n\nUltimately, the key issue is that the author is pressuring his girlfriend to make a life-altering decision that isn't his to control. Abortion is a deeply personal choice, and he doesn't have the authority to demand it. His approach might be causing harm and could be considered manipulative or disrespectful. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
