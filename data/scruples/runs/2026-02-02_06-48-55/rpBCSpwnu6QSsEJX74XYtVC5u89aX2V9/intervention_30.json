Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA for asking my girlfriend to have an abortion?) is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because she didn't use backup protection and didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly. He's not ready for a child, can't support it financially, and is telling her she has to abort or he'll leave. She's considering keeping the baby but is open to abortion to stay with him.\n\nSo, the key points here: both are young, in university, not in a position to have a baby. The woman wasn't taking the pill consistently, possibly due to her schedule. The man is taking a hard stance, saying she's at fault for not communicating the risk, and is pressuring her to abort. \n\nNow, considering ethics and responsibilities. In a relationship, both partners are responsible for contraception. Even if she was on the pill, maybe they should have used condoms as backup. The man might not have considered that. But she also didn't communicate her issues with the pill, which could be a problem. \n\nHowever, when it comes to the decision to terminate a pregnancy, the woman has the right to make that choice. Pressuring her to abort because he doesn't want the child, especially when he's not the one facing the physical and emotional consequences, is a significant issue. The man is essentially saying she's responsible for the pregnancy and he's not willing to accept any responsibility beyond financial support if she keeps the baby. \n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional manipulation. He's using the threat of leaving to pressure her into an abortion, which is not a healthy approach. The decision should be mutual and considerate of both parties' well-being, not a ultimatum. \n\nI think the man is placing blame where it's not entirely deserved. While the woman may have been negligent in taking the pill properly, it's a shared responsibility. Also, the man is not in a position to dictate her medical choices. The fact that he's pressuring her to abort to save the relationship shows a lack of support and empathy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the man is in the wrong. His approach is selfish and not considering her autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
