Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy is asking his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion after she becomes pregnant. They've been dating for seven months and weren't using backup contraception because she was on the pill. She admitted that she wasn't taking the pill consistently due to her university schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The woman is the one who is pregnant, so the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers. The guy is pressuring her to have the abortion, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Even if they weren't using backup protection, it's a shared responsibility in a relationship. The man is placing the blame on her for not taking the pill correctly, but birth control is a shared topic to discuss; they both should have been aware of the risks and maybe used additional protection like condoms if she was unsure about her pill intake.\n\nHe also mentioned that if she wants to be a single mom, he'd support her but if she wants to stay, she must abort. That's putting her in a tough position where she has to choose between her partner and her child. This could be emotionally manipulative. The fact that he's 18 and her 20, both relatively young, adds to the challenge of handling a pregnancy, but it doesn't justify his approach.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body. The man's insistence on the abortion without her explicit agreement is problematic. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's not his decision to make. Additionally, the argument that she should have told him about her inconsistent pill use is valid, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. They both shared the risk, so he can't solely blame her and then pressure her into an abortion.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact. He's causing her distress by making her feel responsible and then giving her an ultimatum. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and support, not making decisions for each other in high-stakes situations. The man's actions, while coming from a place of fear and lack of readiness, are not considerate of her feelings and autonomy.\n\nLegally, in most places, the pregnant person has the legal right to decide about an abortion. So the man doesn't have the authority to make that decision for her. Even if they are in a relationship, that doesn't grant him that right. His ultimatum is essentially a form of coercion, which is wrong.\n\nIn summary, while both parties may share some responsibility for not using additional protection, the man is overstepping by pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion and making her choose between the baby and him. This undermines her autonomy and is not a respectful approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
