Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, 18 and 20, in a seven-month relationship. The girlfriend is pregnant and on the pill but missed doses during vacation. The author is upset she didn't use backup protection or stop having sex, and he's telling her he can't be in a relationship with her if she keeps the baby. He's offering support if she becomes a single mom but insists on an abortion to stay together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a decision about a pregnancy that's not his, and he's using the relationship as a condition. That seems problematic. Even if the girlfriend made a mistake with the pill, the choice to have an abortion should be hers, not a negotiation point. Pressuring her to abort to preserve the relationship is a significant issue because it's a major decision that affects her health and future. The author is also not taking responsibility for the situation; he's placing the blame solely on her for not handling contraception properly. In a healthy relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. The fact that he's 18 and she's 20, both in university with limited resources, adds context, but the moral issue here is about respecting her autonomy. He's not considering her feelings or her potential desire to keep the baby, even if she's uncertain. The fight and his ultimatum could be seen as coercive. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her agency and is making a decision that should be mutual, instead of imposing his will on her.\n"
