Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend got pregnant, even though she was on the pill. The author is 18, and the girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. The author is upset because he expected her to take the pill properly and didn't use backup protection. He then asked her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready for a kid and can't support a child financially.\n\nFirst, I need to think about responsibility. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is her responsibility, right? But maybe both partners should be aware of the risks. The author didn't use a condom, so maybe he shares some responsibility too. The pill isn't 100% effective, even though it's over 99% effective. So maybe the author shouldn't have assumed it was 100% and not used a backup method.\n\nHe's 18, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents. The girlfriend is on student loans. They both don't have the financial stability for a child. That's a real issue. However, the author is making a decision about the pregnancy without her full agreement. She's open to keeping the baby but doesn't know herself. The author is pressuring her to abort, saying he can't stay with her if she doesn't. That seems like he's taking away her autonomy in the decision. Even if he's not ready, the decision about the pregnancy should be hers to make, not him dictating it.\n\nHe also mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him she wasn't on the pill properly. But she said she was struggling with the schedule. Maybe he should have checked in more. But the main point is that he's not respecting her choice by making an ultimatum. It's her body, so even if he has concerns, he can't force her to abort. Also, the way he's handling it is causing emotional harm. He's breaking up with her unless she aborts, which is a huge pressure tactic.\n\nSo, even if both have some responsibility in the situation, the author is wrong in pressuring her to have an abortion and not supporting her in other ways. He's making her the sole decision-maker in a way that's controlling and not respecting her autonomy. The answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
