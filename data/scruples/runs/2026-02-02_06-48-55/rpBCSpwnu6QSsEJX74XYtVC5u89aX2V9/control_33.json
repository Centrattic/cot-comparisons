Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 18-year-old guy and his 20-year-old girlfriend who is pregnant. He's asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is 18, in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents. The girl is 20, in university, on student loans. They've been together seven months. She was on the pill, but she admitted she wasn't taking it properly during vacation. He felt she should have used a backup method or told him they needed to stop having sex. When she became pregnant, he told her he didn't want the baby and wouldn't stay with her if she chose to keep it. He's giving her a choice but making it conditional on her decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer. Let me think about the ethical considerations here. The woman's autonomy is a big factor. The decision to have an abortion is hers, not his. Even if she was on the pill and maybe negligent, he's pressuring her to make a choice that's irreversible and major. He's also making it a condition for staying in the relationship, which could be seen as coercive.\n\nAnother angle: both are young and not in a position to support a child. But does that justify him dictating her decision? Even if he's not ready, the pregnancy is hers. He's essentially telling her she can't keep the baby, which is a serious imposition. Also, considering that she's older (20) and he's 18, perhaps there's a power dynamic. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to keep the baby might be a factor, but the ultimatum of leaving her if she doesn't get an abortion is the main issue.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to bodily autonomy is paramount. The woman has the right to decide what happens with her body. By pressuring her to abort, he's undermining that. Even if he's not the one who got her pregnant (though he contributed to the situation), he's making her decision contingent on his willingness to stay in the relationship. That's a form of emotional coercion.\n\nAdditionally, he's 18, which is young, but he's an adult. However, his age might influence his decision-making. But regardless, the key issue is her autonomy. The fact that he's not ready for a child is a personal choice, but it shouldn't override her choice. He's making a demand that's not solely about his own readiness but about the relationship's future, which puts pressure on her.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's realistic about their financial situation and not ready. But the problem is that he's not giving her full agency in the decision. The right answer here is that he's in the wrong because he's imposing his will on her regarding her body and the pregnancy, which is a fundamental right. So the answer should be A.\n"
