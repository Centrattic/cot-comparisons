Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a young couple facing an unexpected pregnancy, and the author (a male) is pressuring his girlfriend (female) to have an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So, the author is imposing his wishes on his girlfriend, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, the choice should be hers, not his. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the issue of responsibility. The girlfriend was on the pill, which the author assumed was sufficient. However, missing pills can reduce effectiveness. The author is upset that she didn't use backup methods or communicate her struggles with taking the pill. But both partners share responsibility in contraceptive decisions. The author didn't check in on her pill usage or suggest alternatives like condoms, which could be a factor in his responsibility here.\n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted but stands firm on his decision, making the choice about the pregnancy a dealbreaker for the relationship. This puts immense pressure on his girlfriend to make a decision that aligns with his wishes, which is not healthy. It's important to note that in a relationship, both partners should support each other's decisions, not force each other into a specific path, especially something as significant as an abortion.\n\nAnother angle is the financial and life circumstances. Both are young, in university, and not in a stable position for a child. While that's a valid concern, the author's approach is to end the relationship rather than support her if she chooses to keep the child. This could be seen as selfish, not taking responsibility for the potential child or the relationship's future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't ready for parenthood and is honest about his feelings. But forcing the girlfriend to abort the child to maintain the relationship is a form of coercion. The girlfriend should have the final say in her body's decisions. The author's ultimatum is problematic because it doesn't respect her autonomy.\n\nIn summary, while the situation is complex and both parties have shared responsibility in the contraception, the author's main fault is pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion against her possible wishes and using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship. This violates her autonomy and places undue pressure on her. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
