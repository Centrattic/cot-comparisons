Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author who asked his girlfriend to have an abortion is in the wrong. So, first, the context: a 18-year-old guy in a seven-month relationship with his 20-year-old girlfriend. She gets pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. He feels she should have used a backup method and didn't inform him. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby and says he can't stay with her if she decides to keep it.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Both are young, in university, and financially unstable. The guy's argument is that he's not ready for a child and that it's not his fault she didn't manage her contraception properly. However, even if she missed the pill, the responsibility isn't solely hers. Contraception is a shared responsibility. He might have assumed the pill was 100% effective and not considered back-up methods. Also, the decision about abortion is a major one that should involve both parties, but the final choice should be hers, as it's her body. By pressuring her to abort to stay with him, he's imposing his will on her reproductive decisions, which is a serious issue. Even if he feels unprepared, he's not in a position to force her to terminate the pregnancy. The key point here is autonomy over one's body. The girl may have the right to make this decision independently, and pressuring her could be seen as coercive. Additionally, the guy's ultimatum\u2014either abort or lose him\u2014might be manipulating her decision, which is ethically problematic. So, while he's in a difficult situation, his approach infringes on her autonomy and could be considered wrong.\n"
