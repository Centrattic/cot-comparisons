Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author asking their pregnant girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. The girlfriend is pregnant, and she was on the pill. The author feels she should have used backup contraception or communicated her issues with the pill. He's not ready for a child and is pressuring her to abort. The key points are his age, their financial situations, his ultimatum, and her right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not ready, they can't support a child financially, and he holds her responsible for not managing her contraception properly. However, the girlfriend is the one carrying the child and faces the most significant impact from the decision. Her autonomy is crucial here. The author is essentially dictating her choice, which is problematic because the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is typically considered the woman's right.\n\nAlso, considering their ages, both are minors in some jurisdictions (18 and 20), which might add legal or ethical dimensions, but the main ethical issue here is the pressure on the woman. The author is framing the situation as her fault for not handling contraception, which shifts blame onto her. He also gives her an ultimatum, which is a controlling move. Even if he's not ready, he's making her sole decision determine the relationship's future.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). From an ethical standpoint, pressuring someone into an abortion against their will or without considering their autonomy is widely seen as wrong. The author is prioritizing his own unpreparedness over her rights and potential desires. Even if he's in a difficult situation, the decision shouldn't be forced on her. So the answer is likely A.\n"
