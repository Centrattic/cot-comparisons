Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. But she mentioned she wasn't taking it properly due to her schedule during university vacation. He feels tricked because she didn't tell him they might be at risk. He then asks her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready and can't support a child, and even says he can't stay with her if she has the baby. He offers to help financially if she goes the single mom route but wants her to abort to stay together.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girl was on the pill, which is effective when used correctly, but she missed doses. The guy didn't use backup protection, assuming the pill was working. He didn't check if she was taking it properly. She did mention her struggles with the schedule but maybe didn't communicate it clearly. The guy didn't ask her about her pill use, maybe because he trusted it was working. When she told him she was pregnant, he was shocked and then angry. He didn't confront her about the missed doses immediately. Instead, he later told her he didn't want the baby and would leave unless she aborts.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. Both partners have a role in contraception. Even though she was on the pill, he could have used condoms as backup. She didn't inform him about her inconsistent pill use, which is a valid point. However, he didn't check in on her pill adherence either. Communication is key here. They might both share some responsibility for the pregnancy. \n\nThe main issue is the pressure he's putting her to have an abortion. He's making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That's a big red flag. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's not his decision alone. The pregnancy is hers to carry, and she has the right to make her own medical decisions. By making her choice dependent on their relationship, he's placing a significant burden on her. It's not fair to her to force an abortion just to preserve their current lifestyle. \n\nHe mentions loving both the baby and her but can't support a child. That seems contradictory. Also, he's 18 and not ready for parenthood, which is understandable, but using that to pressure her into an abortion might not be the right approach. It's possible that both are young and unprepared, but he's not considering her autonomy and her potential desire to keep the baby. \n\nAnother angle: he's financially unable to support a child, but he's also asking her to sacrifice her own choice. The fact that he's willing to offer financial help only if she chooses to have the baby is another issue. It's a transactional approach. His ultimatum (\"abort or I leave\") is manipulative and doesn't respect her agency. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, perhaps both share some blame for not using proper protection. But the way he's handling the situation, pressuring her into an abortion, is more about his own readiness than her choice. That's where he goes wrong. Even if she made a mistake with the pill, he's not absolving her of all responsibility. The key here is the lack of mutual communication about contraception and his decision to control her medical decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her into an abortion, not respecting her autonomy, and making her choice about her body a condition for his staying in the relationship. Even if there were shared responsibility in the pregnancy, his actions are not justified.\n"
