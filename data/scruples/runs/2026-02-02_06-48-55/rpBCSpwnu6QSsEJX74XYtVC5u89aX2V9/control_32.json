Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy and the boyfriend insisting on an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The boyfriend can't force her to have one, but he's saying he's not willing to be part of the child's life unless she does. That seems like he's pressuring her, which might be a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend is on the pill, but she missed doses due to her schedule. The boyfriend expected her to be careful, but maybe he should have used a backup method too. They were both responsible for contraception. He might feel betrayed because she didn't tell him about missing pills, but he also didn't check if she was on track. Communication is key here.\n\nHe's under a lot of stress because they're young and can't support a child. His main concern is their future, but his approach is to make the decision for her. That's where it gets tricky. Even if he's not ready, the final choice should be hers. Pressuring her to abort could be seen as controlling.\n\nAlso, financially, they can't support a baby. But he's offering to help if she's a single mom, which shows some responsibility, but it's still not his decision to make. The emotional impact on both of them is huge, and he's feeling torn between his love for her and the reality of their situation.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the boyfriend is in a tough spot, but the key point is that the decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy is the woman's right. By making her choose between the baby and their relationship, he's exerting pressure, which is where he's likely in the wrong. Even if he's not ready, he can't impose his will on her. They need to find a solution that respects her autonomy while considering their future together.\n"
