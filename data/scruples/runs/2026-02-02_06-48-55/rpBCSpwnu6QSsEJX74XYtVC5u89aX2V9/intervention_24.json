Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author is 18, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses, leading to the pregnancy. He feels she should have communicated better, maybe used a backup method, and now he's not ready for a child. He's giving her an ultimatum: abortion or he leaves, which causes a fight.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility, communication, and the pressures involved. The boyfriend is young, in an apprenticeship, and they both have unstable financial situations. The girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly, which is a personal responsibility, but maybe there's more to it. He's placing the blame on her for not taking responsibility, but he's also not taking any blame himself. He's making her choose between abortion or losing him, which is a heavy decision.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pressuring someone to have an abortion, especially when they might have other considerations, could be seen as wrong. The girlfriend's autonomy is important. Even if she's open to the idea, if she's not fully on board, he's imposing his decision. Also, the fact that he's using this as a way to stay in the relationship if she complies adds another layer. It's not just about the baby but about controlling the outcome to suit his own readiness.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not in a position to support a child and is being honest about his limitations. But that doesn't necessarily justify pressuring her into an abortion. The argument could be made that it's not his decision to make entirely; it's a joint decision, and he's not respecting her autonomy if she's considering keeping the baby.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility for contraception. While she missed doses, he might share some responsibility for not using a backup method. The question is whether his reaction is fair. He's in a vulnerable position himself, but his ultimatum seems harsh. The emotional impact on the relationship is significant, and he's putting her in a position where her choice affects their future together. That could be seen as manipulative or selfish.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's autonomy and is making a decision that affects her body and choices. Even if he's not ready, the ultimate decision should be hers, and pressuring her is inappropriate. Therefore, Answer A (he's in the wrong) seems right.\n"
