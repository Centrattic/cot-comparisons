Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to examine the situation. The girlfriend is 20, pregnant, and they're both young and in university. The guy is 18, in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and they don't have the financial stability for a child. The girl was on the pill but missed doses because of her schedule during university vacation. The author feels she should have informed him about the risk and used backup protection.\n\nThe girl didn't tell him about the missed pills, leading to the pregnancy. He feels tricked because she knew the risks but didn't communicate. Now, he's pressuring her to have an abortion, saying he can't be part of a child's life now. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Both partners should be on the same page regarding contraception. The girl might have thought she was protected, but missing pills is a risk she should have managed. However, the author's approach here is to make the decision for her. An abortion is a major decision that only the pregnant person can make. By telling her she has to abort or lose him, he's putting pressure on her, which could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful of her autonomy.\n\nEven if he's not ready for parenthood, he's taking away her agency in the decision. The girl mentioned she's open to keeping the baby but isn't clear on her own desires. He's forcing a choice between the baby and the relationship, which is a significant ultimatum. That could place undue stress on her, regardless of his own feelings about being unready. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should support each other's decisions, not force them. His ultimatum might be seen as selfish because it centers his readiness over her autonomy. Even if he's not at fault for the pregnancy, pressuring her in this way is problematic. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
