Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is asking her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. The girlfriend is on the pill but missed doses because her schedule is off during vacation. The author feels she should have used a backup method or stopped having sex. He's not ready for a baby, can't support it financially, and is pressuring her to have an abortion. She's open to keeping it, but he's saying he can't stay with her if she doesn't abort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, a woman's right to choose is a big factor here. Even if the author believes he's not at fault, the decision about pregnancy should be hers. Pressuring someone for an abortion can be seen as wrong, especially if he's not considering her autonomy. Also, the fact that the girlfriend didn't use backup protection\u2014while it's a risk, it's not necessarily her fault if the pill failed. The author is placing blame on her, which might not be fair. He's making a decision that affects her body, which is a significant ethical issue. \n\nHowever, the author is also a minor, and both are in a difficult situation financially. But that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. The main point is that the woman should have the final say in her reproductive choices. The author is not in the wrong legally if the law allows them to make that decision together, but ethically, it's questionable. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's pressuring her for an abortion without considering her autonomy. So the answer would be A.\n"
