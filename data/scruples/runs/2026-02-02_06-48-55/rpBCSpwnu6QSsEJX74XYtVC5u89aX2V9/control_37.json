Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, and not in a position to have a child. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. The author feels she should have used backup protection or communicated better, and now he's pressuring her to abort the pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The author is making a demand that might infringe on her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's her body and her choice. The fact that he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort could be manipulating her decision, which is problematic.\n\nThen there's the communication angle. The girlfriend didn't take the pill properly, but the author assumed she was using it correctly. Both parties have responsibility in contraception. However, the author's reaction seems harsh. Pressuring her to abort without considering her feelings and choices is a key issue here. He's putting her in a situation where she has to choose between losing the baby or losing him, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, considering their age and financial instability, they're both in an unprepared situation. But the author's approach of making her decide and not taking responsibility for the situation might make him at fault. He's not offering support or shared decision-making, which is important in such matters. The fact that he feels tricked because she didn't tell him about missing pills shows a lack of understanding of the complexities involved in taking medication consistently, especially during a different schedule.\n\nIn summary, while both might share some responsibility in the contraception mishap, the author's insistence on the abortion and the ultimatum he gives could be seen as him being in the wrong. His approach doesn't respect her autonomy and adds emotional pressure, which isn't acceptable. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
