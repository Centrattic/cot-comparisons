Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 18-year-old male) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend (20 years old) to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is legally the woman's choice. Even though the man is involved, he doesn't have the legal authority to make that decision for her. The author is trying to impose his will on her, which could be problematic.\n\nNext, the responsibility of contraception. The story mentions that the girlfriend was on the pill, but she admitted to not taking it properly. The author expected her to use it correctly and didn't use backup methods. This shows a shared responsibility issue. However, the author didn't check in with her about her pill usage, so maybe he shares some blame there. But the main point here is about the abortion decision.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not ready for a child and that they can't afford it. While his concerns are valid, the critical factor is that he's pressuring her to have an abortion instead of supporting her if she chooses to keep the baby. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided yet. By not being supportive and instead making it a condition for staying in the relationship, the author is forcing her into a decision that affects her body and future. This seems coercive.\n\nThe emotional impact is also significant. The girlfriend is upset, and the author is making it about his readiness rather than her agency. Even though he loves her, his ultimatum is controlling and doesn't respect her autonomy. The decision to have an abortion should be hers alone, based on her circumstances and desires, not a condition for maintaining the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author is young and in a situation where they both have limited resources. The pressure here is on the woman to make a life-altering decision, which is unfair. The man is not offering support for either choice, which is a key part of being a partner in such a situation.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, the right to bodily autonomy is crucial. The woman has the right to decide what happens to her body. The author is infringing on that by making the abortion a condition for continuing the relationship. Even if he feels responsible, he can't override her decision-making power in this matter.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion, not respecting her autonomy, and making it a requirement to stay in the relationship. This is a significant ethical issue, and he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
