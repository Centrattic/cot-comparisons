Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is 18, his girlfriend is 20, and she's pregnant. They've been dating for seven months. The main issue is whether he's right to ask her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the right to make decisions about one's own body, especially regarding pregnancy, is a significant factor. The girlfriend is the one carrying the child, so she might have the legal right to decide whether to continue the pregnancy. So, if the author is pressuring her to have an abortion, that could be seen as infringing on her autonomy.\n\nThen there's the emotional and relational aspect. The user is young, 18, and in an apprenticeship. They both have limited financial resources. He feels shocked because she was on the pill, but she mentioned she wasn't taking it properly. He's angry that she didn't tell him they might be at risk. However, it's important to note that the responsibility for contraception isn't solely on the female partner. Even if she stopped taking the pill, they could have used condoms. The user's reaction seems to place the blame on her, which might be unfair. They both are young and in a committed relationship, so shared responsibility is key.\n\nHe asked her to have an abortion and said he can't stay with her if she doesn't. That's a heavy ultimatum. Even if he's not ready for a child, making her choose between the abortion or losing him might be considered selfish. The girlfriend expressed openness to keeping the baby but didn't commit either way. The author's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her, which is problematic because the decision should be hers. \n\nAlso, considering their age and the situation, they might not be emotionally mature enough to handle a pregnancy. However, the author's approach seems to disregard her autonomy and the emotional impact of his ultimatum on her. The fact that he's willing to offer financial support if she becomes a single mother shows some responsibility, but the way he's framing the situation as her fault could be the core issue here.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, the right to bodily autonomy is a strong point. The author doesn't have the right to force her to have an abortion. Even if they love each other, the decision to continue a pregnancy is hers to make. By giving her an ultimatum, he's not respecting her agency. Additionally, the initial blame he places on her for not taking the pill correctly might not be entirely fair because they both should have been using protection. The user's lack of follow-up on whether she was taking the pill as directed could also be a factor. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that affects her body and he's placing blame on her without considering shared responsibility. The answer would be A.\n"
