Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but didn't take it properly. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop having sex. Now, he's saying he's not ready for a baby and won't stay with her if she keeps it, effectively forcing her to have an abortion to stay with him.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girl is the one who is pregnant, and the decision about the pregnancy should be hers to make. Even though the guy feels responsible, the physical and emotional burden of carrying a pregnancy is on the woman. The guy's ultimatum is essentially putting pressure on her to terminate the pregnancy to maintain their relationship. That's a big ethical issue because it's her body and her decision. \n\nHe's also placing blame on her for not handling contraception properly, which is fair in a way since both partners should be responsible, but the main decision here is hers. By making her choose between the baby and the relationship, he's infringing on her autonomy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of their age and life circumstances. They're both young, in university, and not financially stable. But that doesn't justify pressuring her to abort. The right to make decisions about one's own body is a fundamental right. The guy's actions here could be seen as manipulative, making her feel guilty or responsible for their relationship's future. \n\nEven if he's not ready to be a parent, it's not his decision to make. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to keep the baby but wants her to abort to stay together shows a conflict of interest. He wants to avoid responsibility for the child but still wants the relationship. That's a classic example of shifting responsibility onto the woman, which is unfair.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion against her will. The decision should be hers, and his ultimatum is coercive. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
