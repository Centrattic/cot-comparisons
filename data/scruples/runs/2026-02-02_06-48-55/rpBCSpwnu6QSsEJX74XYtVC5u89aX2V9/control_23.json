Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author (the guy) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he asked his girlfriend to have an abortion. They're both young, in university, and not in a financial position to have a baby. The girlfriend is on the pill but missed some doses because of her schedule. He found out about the pregnancy and told her he didn't want the baby and that if she wanted to keep it, he'd leave. He also said he'd support her financially if she chose to be a single mom but only if she aborts, he'll stay with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is primarily the woman's, as it's her body. The guy can't force her to have one or not have one. But he's pressuring her here, which is a problem. Even if he's not forcing her, putting conditions on their relationship based on her decision could be manipulation. \n\nHe's also placing blame on her for not handling contraception properly. The pill isn't 100% effective, even if taken correctly. But she admitted she missed doses. However, it's a shared responsibility in a relationship. Maybe they should have used a backup method. But he expected her to take the pill properly, which she didn't. However, is that her fault entirely? She might have issues with the schedule, but she didn't communicate that. \n\nHe didn't confront her about her missed pills earlier, which could be a point. He might have contributed by not using protection. Also, he's now making a decision that affects her body and her future. Even if he's not ready, the final choice should be hers. He's threatening to leave if she chooses to keep the baby, which is putting pressure on her decision. \n\nEthically, the woman should have autonomy over her reproductive choices. The man's stance could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's not his decision to make. He's also making her choose between her child and the relationship, which is a tough spot. \n\nFinancially, both can't support a baby, but that's the reality. However, that doesn't mean the man should impose his will on her. They could have discussed options like adoption, but he didn't mention that. His main focus is on abortion, which is a personal choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is in the wrong because he's pressuring her into a decision that's not his to make and is using the relationship as leverage. Even if he's not ready, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers. His actions are manipulative and disregard her autonomy.\n"
