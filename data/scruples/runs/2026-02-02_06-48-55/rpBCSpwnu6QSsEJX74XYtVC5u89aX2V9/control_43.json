Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a 18-year-old male and a 20-year-old female in a seven-month relationship. The girlfriend became pregnant, and the author is upset because she didn't use backup contraception despite being on the pill. He feels she should have informed him about her irregular pill use and is now pressuring her to abort the pregnancy, threatening to leave her if she doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are the author's responsibility, communication, and the pressure to terminate the pregnancy. The author is under 18, which might affect his maturity and decision-making. He's also in an apprenticeship and financially dependent on his parents. The girlfriend is a student with limited resources. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the girlfriend didn't handle contraception properly and that she should have used backup methods. However, the pill is not 100% effective, and even with proper use, it's not foolproof. The girlfriend mentioned she struggled with her schedule, which could be a valid reason for the pill's reduced effectiveness. The author's anger seems to stem from feeling tricked, which might stem from not being aware of her challenges. \n\nWhen the pregnancy is discovered, the author immediately focuses on his own inexperience and financial inability to care for a child. He then pressures her to abort, essentially giving her an ultimatum: abortion or he leaves the relationship. This puts the decision-making burden solely on her and doesn't respect her autonomy regarding her own body. Even though he says he loves her, the ultimatum could be seen as coercive, especially if she's not ready to make that decision under pressure.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. By pressuring her to have an abortion, the author is not respecting her agency. Additionally, he blames her for the situation, which is unfair because contraceptive failure isn't always her fault. The pill's effectiveness depends on both partners' behaviors, though primarily the user's. However, the author's responsibility includes ensuring they use protection if there's any doubt about the pill's efficacy.\n\nThe age difference and life stages are also factors. Both are young and might not be in a position to handle a child. The author's threat to leave if she doesn't abort could be seen as selfish, as it prioritizes his own needs over her potential desire to have the child. Even if he isn't ready, the decision should be hers to make, not his. \n\nHowever, one might argue that he's also a minor and not in a position to support a child. His concerns about being unprepared are valid, but how he handles it matters. The way he's pressuring her without considering her feelings or options is problematic. The ethical issue here is about respecting her autonomy versus his own inexperience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion, not respecting her autonomy, and placing blame on her for the pregnancy despite the pill's inherent risks. The answer is A.\n"
