Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the guy is asking her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is 18, the girl is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she didn't take it properly during vacation. He's upset she didn't use backup and didn't tell him. When she gets pregnant, he's shocked and not ready. He asks her to abort, saying he can't handle a child right now. If she wants to keep the baby, he won't stay with her. He offers financial support if she's a single mom but wants her to abort to stay together.\n\nNow, the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's think about the responsibilities here. Both are adults, but young. Contraception is a shared responsibility. The girl was on the pill but missed doses. The guy didn't use a condom as backup. So maybe both share some responsibility. However, the guy didn't check if she was taking the pill consistently. The girl had the right to choose her method, but maybe she should have communicated her struggles with the pill earlier.\n\nThe guy's main issue is that he's not ready for a child and doesn't want to be part of a single-parent situation. He's offering support if she chooses to have the baby, but is that fair? He's saying that if she wants to keep the baby, they can't stay together. That seems controlling. The decision to terminate a pregnancy is up to the woman, and pressuring her to have an abortion could be seen as wrong. His reasoning that it's her fault for not handling contraception properly is problematic because it shifts blame onto her without acknowledging his own role in not using additional protection.\n\nAlso, he's in a position where he's making the decision for her, which is a big issue. The woman has the right to make her own medical decisions. By saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby, he's effectively pressuring her. Even if he's not ready, it's not her responsibility to abort the baby just to maintain the relationship. The emotional impact on her and the relationship is significant.\n\nIn terms of laws and ethics, in many places, the woman has the right to choose, and the partner can't force her to terminate. His ultimatum seems to ignore her autonomy. The fact that he's 18 and not in a stable financial situation might contribute to his fear, but that doesn't justify pressuring her. Both need to communicate and decide together, but he's making it a take-it-or-leave-it situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is putting pressure on his girlfriend to make a life-altering decision that's not his to control. Even if there's shared responsibility for the pregnancy, the decision to abort is hers. By making her choice affect the continuation of their relationship, he's being selfish and not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
