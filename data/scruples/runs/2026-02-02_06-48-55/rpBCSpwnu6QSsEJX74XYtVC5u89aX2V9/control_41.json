Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right, and the partner doesn't have legal authority to make that choice for her. The author is 18, which is young, and both are in a university setting with limited resources. \n\nThe girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses, which the author found out after the fact. He's upset that she didn't communicate better about her contraceptive use. However, even if there was miscommunication, the responsibility for contraception isn't solely on the woman. It's a shared responsibility, and maybe they should have used a backup method like condoms.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's not ready for a child and can't financially support a baby. While his concerns are valid, he's essentially making the decision for his girlfriend regarding her body. Pressuring someone to have an abortion can be seen as controlling. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to keep the baby shows some consideration, but the ultimatum he gives\u2014either abort or lose him\u2014could be coercive.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact. He acknowledges he's being a \"dick\" but still insists on his stance. The girlfriend is upset, and he's aware of the strain on their relationship. Ethically, respecting her autonomy is crucial. Even if he's not pro-choice himself, he can't impose his views on her decisions about her own body.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is open to both options, but he's not considering her feelings or her potential desire to keep the baby. His reaction is partly based on anger about the situation, which might cloud his judgment. The fact that he's financially dependent on his parents and living with them adds to his inexperience in handling such a life-changing decision.\n\nIn summary, while the situation is complex and both parties have valid concerns, the author is overstepping by pressuring his girlfriend to make a medical decision. It's her body, and he shouldn't dictate her choice, even if it means the relationship ends. So, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
