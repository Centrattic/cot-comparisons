Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy, who's 18, is dating a 20-year-old girlfriend. They've been together seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly, so he feels she didn't use back-up like condoms. He's not ready for a baby, he's in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and they can't afford or handle a child. He told her he doesn't want the baby and if she wants to keep it, he can't stay with her. She's upset, and he feels like an asshole but stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is whether it's right for the author to pressure his girlfriend to have an abortion. Both are young, and they're in a committed relationship, but they're not in a position to have a child. The girl is open to keeping the baby but might not be ready either. The author is taking a stance that the abortion is necessary because of the circumstances. But is it his choice to make? In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person, not the partner. So, telling her she must have an abortion if she wants to keep the relationship could be seen as pressuring her, which is wrong. Even if he's not ready, the decision shouldn't rest solely on him.\n\nAlso, the author is placing blame on the girlfriend for not taking the pill properly. He mentions that he expected her to take it properly and that her not being on her normal schedule isn't an excuse. But he was also relying on the pill as the sole form of contraception, which, while effective, isn't 100%. So, maybe he also should have considered using a backup method, like condoms. The fact that he didn't and now is holding her responsible might be part of the problem. The responsibility for contraception is often shared, and relying solely on the female's method without a backup could be seen as not being fully responsible.\n\nHe also says he's not ready and can't look after a child, which is understandable. But the decision to have an abortion is a major one, and he's making it conditional on their relationship. That could be putting pressure on her to make a choice that's not entirely her own. Even if he's not in a position to support a child, it's her body and her decision. Telling her that she can't stay with him if she chooses to keep the baby might be overstepping his role as a partner. He's effectively saying her right to make a choice about her own body is contingent on maintaining the relationship with him, which is a form of control.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not financially stable, and having a child would be a huge burden. His feelings of being unprepared are valid. But how he's handling the situation is questionable. Instead of giving her an ultimatum, maybe he should have discussed all options together, including adoption or support if she chooses to keep the baby. By taking a hard line and not considering her feelings or autonomy, he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not respecting his girlfriend's autonomy in the decision. The choice to have an abortion is hers, not his. Pressuring her to make that choice for the sake of their relationship is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
