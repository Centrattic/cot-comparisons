Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about wanting his girlfriend to have an abortion is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant. He's a student, has an apprenticeship, they both don't have the financial stability for a child. He's upset because she was on the pill but didn't take it properly, and didn't use backup protection. He feels she should have told him they needed to stop or use condoms. Then he asks her to have an abortion, and says he can't stay with her if she has the baby. She's upset, and he feels conflicted but insists on this.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider different angles. One perspective is that he's being selfish, not considering her autonomy. The decision about an abortion should be hers to make, not him. He's pressuring her into a choice that's not hers to make. On the other hand, he's young, not ready for a child, and they can't afford it. But does that give him the right to demand an abortion? Also, he's placing blame on her for not using contraception properly. But she did use the pill, which is mostly effective, but she had issues with the schedule. Maybe he should have used a condom as backup regardless. \n\nHe didn't mention using protection, so maybe he's also at fault for not taking responsibility. The fact that he's now making the decision for her, even though she's open to keeping the baby, could be a violation of her rights. In many places, the woman has the right to choose, and the partner can't force her. However, the question is about being in the \"wrong\" morally, not legally. \n\nHe's putting pressure on her, which could be emotional manipulation. He's using the relationship as leverage, saying he'll leave if she doesn't abort. That's a big red flag. Even if he's not ready for a child, making her choose between the baby and the relationship is controlling. Also, he's not offering support if she wants to keep the baby, which might be a factor. So, from a moral standpoint, he's acting selfishly and not respecting her autonomy, even if his reasons are about their circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A). But maybe there's a nuance. He's young, stressed, and the situation is difficult. However, the key issue is his ultimatum and lack of respect for her agency. So A makes sense.\n"
