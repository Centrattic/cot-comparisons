Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who asked the question is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who's 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses due to being on vacation and not on her normal schedule. He feels she should have used backup contraception or told him to stop having sex. He's not ready to be a parent, can't afford it, and tells her he won't stay with her if she doesn't have an abortion. She's upset, and he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of responsibility. Both partners in a relationship share responsibility for contraception. Even if one is on the pill, it's not 100% effective, and using additional methods like condoms is a common practice to reduce the risk. The guy mentions expecting her to take the pill properly but didn't use condoms. So maybe he shares some responsibility here. However, the pill is her method, so perhaps she's the one responsible for its proper use. But he could have suggested using condoms as a backup, which he didn't.\n\nHe says he's angry because she didn't tell him they were at risk. But maybe he should have asked her if she was still on the pill correctly. Open communication is key in relationships. If she was struggling with her schedule, maybe he could have noticed and discussed it. But she didn't mention it until after the pregnancy was known.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion. The key here is that the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers. Even though he's not ready for parenthood, he's imposing his decision on her. The girlfriend says she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't specify her own desires. The guy is saying that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her. This seems like he's making her choice for her, which isn't her right. She should have autonomy over her own body and reproductive decisions.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and living situations, they're both young and financially unstable. But that doesn't mean he can dictate her choices. Even if he's not ready, that doesn't give him the right to force her to terminate a pregnancy. The emotional impact on her is significant, and he's contributing to the stress by making ultimatums.\n\nThere's also the aspect of maturity. At 18 and 20, they might not have the emotional maturity to handle such a situation. The guy's reaction could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own readiness over her autonomy. However, he's also expressing that he loves her but can't handle the situation, which adds complexity.\n\nIn many places, laws and ethical standards emphasize that the pregnant person has the right to choose what happens to their body. So, even if he's not ready, he can't make that decision for her. His ultimatum is a form of coercion, which is ethically wrong.\n\nAnother angle is communication. He didn't communicate his concerns about the pregnancy early on. He waited until after the fact, which might have caused unnecessary conflict. If he had discussed his concerns before she found out, maybe they could have come to a mutual decision. But since it's already happened, his response is to pressure her to abort, which is problematic.\n\nIn summary, while both might share some responsibility for the pregnancy, the main issue is the guy's insistence that she must have an abortion to continue the relationship. That's a violation of her autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
