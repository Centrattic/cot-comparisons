Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, both are young, 18 and 20, in university. The girlfriend is on the pill, but she admitted to missing doses because of her schedule. The author feels she should have used backup contraception or communicated better. When she gets pregnant, he's shocked and isn't ready for a child. He tells her he doesn't want the baby and that he can't stay with her if she keeps it. He offers financial support if she chooses to have the baby but wants her to abort to stay together. They fight, and he's conflicted but stands by his decision.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The key points are autonomy and responsibility. The girlfriend is the one carrying the child, so she has the right to make decisions about her body. The author is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which can be seen as imposing his will on her. Even though he feels it's her fault for not managing the contraception, he's not the one who has to carry the pregnancy. Also, the fact that he's not ready and can't provide for a child is his personal stance, but that doesn't give him the right to dictate her choice. In many contexts, a person's right to choose an abortion is a fundamental right, so pressuring someone to have one could be seen as wrong. However, the situation is complex. He's not forcing her, but he's ending the relationship if she doesn't comply. That could be a form of emotional pressure. On the other hand, he's being honest about his inability to handle the situation. But in terms of rights, the decision should be hers. So, the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion, as it's her body and her choice. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
