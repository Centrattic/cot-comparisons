Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because he thought she was on the pill, which he researched as over 99% effective. She said she wasn't taking the pill properly because she's on vacation and her schedule is off. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him to stop sex. Now he wants her to have an abortion, and he's saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is he wrong? Well, the key points here are about responsibility, communication, and autonomy. The girl is 20, which is an adult age, so she's legally an adult. She chose to be on the pill, but she's admitting she wasn't taking it properly. The guy argues that she should have communicated this to him and taken other precautions. But she didn't, which led to pregnancy.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the decision of an abortion, it's her body. The man is pressuring her to have an abortion, which can be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision should be hers. He's essentially saying he can't be in a relationship with her if she keeps the baby, which is making the choice about their relationship based on her medical decision. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, the right to bodily autonomy is crucial. The girlfriend's choice to have or not have an abortion is her own. The man's insistence that she must abort to stay with him might be seen as a breach of her autonomy. Also, he's not offering support in other ways, like financial help or commitment if she keeps the baby, which could be another point. \n\nAdditionally, the argument about her not taking the pill properly: while it's true that she's responsible for her contraception, the onus isn't solely on the woman. Using condoms or other forms of protection is a shared responsibility. He might have assumed the pill was 100% effective despite her not taking it correctly, but that's a risk both partners take when relying on any birth control method. \n\nSo, even if she was negligent in taking the pill, the fact that he's pressuring her to abort and threatening to leave if she doesn't could be seen as wrong. It's important to consider both parties' responsibilities, but the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers, and pressuring her could be considered manipulative.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The girl is upset, and he's making her feel guilty. He's also not considering her feelings about the baby, as she's open to keeping it. By making the decision for her, even if he feels it's necessary, he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex and both parties have some responsibility, the key issue is the man's pressure on her to have an abortion, which infringes on her right to make her own medical decisions. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
