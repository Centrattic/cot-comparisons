Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're both young, 18 and 20, in university, not financially stable. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses during her vacation. The author feels she should have informed him about the risk, maybe used backup protection. He then tells her that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her, effectively pressuring her to abort.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is placing a significant burden on the pregnant person. The girlfriend is the one carrying the pregnancy, and he's making a decision that affects her body and her future. Even if he's not ready, the responsibility isn't solely hers. The pill's effectiveness isn't 100%, so expecting her to take it perfectly might be unrealistic. He didn't mention using condoms as a backup, which is a shared responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which is a major decision. He's suggesting that her choice to keep the baby would mean losing him. That could be seen as coercive, especially given her emotional state. The fact that he's willing to cut off the relationship if she doesn't abort shows a lack of support and a prioritization of his own unpreparedness over her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a position to handle a child, which is a valid concern. But the way he's handling it is problematic. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a feminist perspective, the pressure on the pregnant person to terminate is a key issue. The author isn't taking shared responsibility; instead, he's shifting blame and making decisions for her body. So, the answer leans towards A, he's in the wrong.\n"
