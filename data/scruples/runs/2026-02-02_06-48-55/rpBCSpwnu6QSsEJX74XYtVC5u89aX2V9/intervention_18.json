Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple, both in university, with the girlfriend becoming pregnant. The guy is 18, she's 20. They've been dating seven months. He's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during her vacation, leading to pregnancy. He then asks her to have an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right. The man can't legally force her to have an abortion. So even if he's not the one carrying the child, the choice should ultimately be hers. The fact that he's pressuring her to abort because he's not ready might be problematic. He's essentially putting her in a position where she has to choose between losing him and having the baby or aborting. That could be seen as manipulative or invalidating her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the guy is placing responsibility on her because she missed doses. But both partners share responsibility in contraceptive use. He didn't suggest using a backup method like condoms, and she wasn't taking the pill properly. However, holding her entirely responsible might not be fair. Still, it's important to note that the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is hers, and he's imposing his will on that decision.\n\nEmotionally, he's in a vulnerable situation. He's young, not financially stable, and the pregnancy is causing stress. But his response\u2014telling her she must abort or he'll leave\u2014might be seen as selfish and not supporting her. He's not considering her emotional state or potential desire to have the baby. Even if she's open to keeping the baby, he's dictating the outcome. That could be seen as controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, he's in a difficult position. He's not ready for parenthood, and financially, they're not prepared. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave and pressuring her\u2014might be the wrong approach. The fact that he's considering supporting her as a single mom financially is a positive, but the ultimatum about the abortion is the key issue here.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the guy is making her decision for her, which is against her rights. Even if he's not at fault for the pregnancy (though some might argue both share responsibility), he shouldn't be pressuring her. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
