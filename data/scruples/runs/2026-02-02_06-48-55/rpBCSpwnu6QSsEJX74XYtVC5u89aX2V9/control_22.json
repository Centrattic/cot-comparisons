Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy that resulted from the girlfriend missing her birth control pills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is 18, has an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and they both have limited financial resources. The girlfriend is 20, a university student, and they've been dating seven months. She stopped taking the pill properly because of her university vacation schedule, which the boyfriend didn't expect as an excuse. He felt she should have used backup protection or communicated better.\n\nHe didn't want the baby and told her he couldn't stay with her if she chose to keep it. He offered financial support if she decided to be a single mother. He's conflicted but feels it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception properly.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Factors to consider: mutual decision-making in such a significant choice, his age and maturity, the pressure to have an abortion, and the emotional impact on the girlfriend.\n\nIn many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. By pressuring her to abort, the boyfriend is imposing his will on her. Even if they both are unprepared, the choice shouldn't be forced. He's making a decision that affects her body and future without her full autonomy. Also, his reaction seems to lack empathy for her potential feelings and the fact that she might want to keep the baby despite the challenges.\n\nHe's placing blame on her for missing pills, but both share responsibility for contraception. He could have suggested condoms as a backup, but he didn't. His ultimatum may be harsh, cutting off the relationship if she doesn't abort, which is controlling.\n\nEthically, the woman has the right to decide her reproductive choices. The boyfriend's stance undermines her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, forcing a choice on her is wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to control.\n"
