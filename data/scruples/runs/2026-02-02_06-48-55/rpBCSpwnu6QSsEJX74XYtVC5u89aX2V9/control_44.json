Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man asking his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The man is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and she's on the pill, which is over 99% effective. He thought she was taking it properly, but she admitted she missed doses during university vacation, leading to the pregnancy. He's not ready for a baby due to his apprenticeship, living with parents, and financial instability. They discuss, and he tells her he can't be in a relationship with a baby, so if she wants to keep it, she has to abort. She's upset, and he's conflicted but feels it's necessary.\n\nNow, considering the question: is he in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The man's viewpoint is that he's not in a position to support a child and that the responsibility for contraception was hers. The girlfriend, however, is in a position where she might feel pressured to make a decision that's not hers. Also, the fact that he's giving her an ultimatum about the pregnancy. \n\nIn many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. Even though they're both young and not ready, it's not her fault the pill failed. She might have made a mistake, but the man is holding it against her and making her the sole decision-maker. He's also using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship if she chooses to keep the baby. That could be seen as pressuring her into an abortion, which is ethically problematic. \n\nHe mentions he's not ready and can't take care of a child. But the girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor here. Even if he's not ready, she is the one who has to carry the pregnancy. The ultimatum he's given her could be seen as manipulating her choice. Additionally, the fact that he didn't support her in any other way besides financial if she chose to keep the baby might not be enough. \n\nThere's also the aspect of their ages and being in a stable place. They're both students, so the financial and emotional burden is real. But the question is about who is in the wrong. The key point is whether pressuring her to abort is wrong. If he's not supporting her in any other way except that if she aborts, they can stay together, that's a conflict of interest. He's essentially saying her choice to have the baby means the end of their relationship, which could be a form of coercion. \n\nAlso, in the initial scenario, he expected her to be on the pill properly. But the pill's effectiveness relies on consistent use. Missing doses isn't a rare occurrence, and the man might be placing undue blame on her for the situation. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the woman has the right to make her own reproductive decisions. The man shouldn't be pressuring her to abort just because he's not ready. Even if he's not ready, that's not her responsibility. Therefore, the man is in the wrong for making the abortion a condition for staying in the relationship. \n\nAdditionally, the way he's framing it as \"not his fault\" she didn't handle contraception properly could be seen as abdicating shared responsibility. They should have discussed contraception and maybe used a backup method, but the fact that he's holding her mistake against her in this way is problematic. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). His ultimatum is pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion, which is her personal decision, and he's not offering to support her if she chooses to keep the baby. Instead, he's making the abortion a condition for their relationship continuing, which is not his right to impose.\n"
