Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She gets pregnant while on the pill. He's shocked because he thought the pill was over 99% effective. He feels she should have used backup or told him they needed to stop having sex when she wasn't on her normal schedule. He then asks her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready, they can't afford a baby, and that it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception properly. He tells her he can't stay with her if she has the baby, giving her money but wanting her to abort if they stay together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the woman, especially if she's the one carrying the child. The man doesn't have the authority to make that decision for her. Even though he's involved, the woman's autonomy is key here. So by pressuring her to have an abortion, he's not respecting her right to make that choice. \n\nThen there's the responsibility aspect. Both partners share responsibility in contraception. Even though she was on the pill, he might assume she's managing it, but it's a shared responsibility. He didn't offer backup methods, and she didn't communicate her issues with the pill. But the fact that he's placing the blame solely on her and not taking any responsibility himself is a problem. \n\nHe's young, 18, and not in a financial position to support a child. That's understandable, but using that as a reason to pressure her into an abortion without considering her feelings or her autonomy is where the issue lies. He's making a decision that affects her body and her future. Even if he's against the baby, he can't force her to have an abortion. \n\nAlso, the way he's framing it as her fault for not handling contraception properly is unfair. They both should have discussed and managed contraception together. He didn't check in on whether she was taking the pill correctly or offer alternatives. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion, which is a major decision she should make for herself. He's not respecting her autonomy and is placing blame on her without taking shared responsibility. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
