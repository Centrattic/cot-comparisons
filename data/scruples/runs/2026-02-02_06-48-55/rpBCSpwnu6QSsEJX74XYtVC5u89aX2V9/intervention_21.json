Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is an 18-year-old male who's been dating his 20-year-old girlfriend for seven months. She got pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during university vacation. He feels she should have used backup contraception or told him to stop having sex. Now he's telling her she needs to have an abortion if she wants to stay with him, otherwise, he can't support them financially and they can't handle a baby. She's considering keeping the baby, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion isn't solely up to the father. Legally, the mother usually has the right to make that choice. So if the author is pressuring her to have an abortion, that might be an issue because he doesn't have the legal authority to make that decision for her. Even if he's not financially ready, that doesn't mean he can dictate her choice.\n\nEmotionally, this is a tough situation. Both are young, in university, and financially unstable. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is generally reliable, but she missed doses. The author feels she didn't communicate the risks, but she admitted she knew the risks. However, missing a pill isn't always easy to prevent, especially if she's stressed or out of her routine. He's placing blame on her for not using backup, but maybe he should have suggested other forms of protection too. Responsibility in contraception is usually shared, but it's not always clear-cut.\n\nThe author's main point is that he's not ready for a child and can't support it financially. That's a valid concern. However, telling her she must have an abortion to stay with him is a big demand. It's making her choice dependent on his willingness to stay, which could be seen as pressuring her. The girlfriend's autonomy in this decision is crucial. He's essentially saying he can't be part of the child's life, but he's pushing for an abortion, which might not be her choice.\n\nAnother angle: the author is young and might not fully grasp the weight of his words. He's in an emotional state, and while he's being honest about his readiness, the way he's handling the situation could be hurtful. He's also considering offering financial support if she has the baby, but that might not be feasible long-term. However, the fact that he's offering any support shows he's trying to be responsible, but the ultimatum he's giving is problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have responsibilities. The girlfriend might have been negligent in taking the pill, but the author could have taken steps to prevent pregnancy as well, like using condoms. The argument that she should have told him she wasn't taking the pill properly is valid, but maybe he should have checked in with her about contraception. It's a shared responsibility.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting the child, but ethically, pressuring her to abort might be wrong because it's her body. He can't dictate her medical decisions. The fact that he's giving her an ultimatum based on his readiness, not hers, could be seen as selfish. He's prioritizing his own life circumstances over her autonomy in the situation.\n\nSo putting it all together, while the author's concerns are understandable, the way he's handling the situation\u2014imposing his decision on her\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. The key point is respecting her autonomy in the abortion decision. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n"
