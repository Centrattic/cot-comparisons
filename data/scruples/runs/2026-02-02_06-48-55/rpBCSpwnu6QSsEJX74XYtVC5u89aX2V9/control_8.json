Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20 and pregnant. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, which she's not taking properly because of her university vacation schedule. The boyfriend is 18, in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and they both don't have the means to support a child. The girlfriend mentions she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't clearly state her preference. The boyfriend then tells her he doesn't want the baby and that if she wants to stay with him, she must abort it. He also says he'll support her financially if she's a single mom, but that he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and mutual decision-making. The boyfriend is placing the decision entirely on the girlfriend, which raises ethical concerns. Even though he feels she should have used better contraception, the decision to have an abortion is a major one that both partners should ideally make together. However, in many places, the final decision rests with the woman, as it's her body. The boyfriend's ultimatum might be seen as pressuring her, which can be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's responsibility. She admits to not taking the pill properly, which the boyfriend points out. However, he didn't use a backup method either, so both share some responsibility. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as holding her solely accountable, which might not be fair given that he also didn't take precautions like using condoms once she mentioned the pill wasn't reliable.\n\nLegally and ethically, the woman has the right to make her own reproductive choices. The boyfriend's ultimatum could be seen as overstepping, as he's dictating her medical decisions. Even if he's not financially able to support a child, the decision to have an abortion should be hers to make, not his. His offer to provide financial support if she chooses to keep the baby is a positive aspect, but the ultimatum of breaking up if she doesn't abort might be emotional manipulation.\n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend is in a difficult position, but pressuring his partner into an abortion isn't his right. The situation is complex, and both parties have shared responsibility. However, the act of making her choice about her own body contingent on their relationship status is where he's in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Also, the girlfriend's willingness to consider keeping the baby without clear communication complicates things, but the main issue is his ultimatum.\n"
