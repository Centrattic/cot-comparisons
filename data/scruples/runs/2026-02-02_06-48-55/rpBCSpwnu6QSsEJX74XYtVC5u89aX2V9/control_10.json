Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Ask the Internets\" post is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's not ready. He's in an apprenticeship with a small wage, living with his parents. She's a university student on student loans. They both don't have the financial or emotional stability for a baby.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admitted she wasn't taking it properly during vacation. The author feels she should have communicated that to him and either used condoms or stopped having sex. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby and that he can't stay with her if she chooses to keep it.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately up to the pregnant person. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which could be seen as imposing his will on her body. Even if he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, he has a say in the decision, but there's a line where his influence becomes controlling.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, which complicates things. He's essentially giving her an ultimatum: abort or lose him. That's a significant pressure tactic. Even if he's not financially ready, it's her body and her choice. In many ethical frameworks, bodily autonomy is a key right. So, by pressuring her to abort, he might be violating her autonomy.\n\nBut also, he's young and not ready. He's in a vulnerable position himself. The question is whether his actions are in the wrong. Legally, if they have mutual consent and she decides to have the abortion, it's her choice. But ethically, pressuring her could be seen as wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend didn't communicate her missed pills. That's a factor, but the author is now making a decision that affects her. Even if she was negligent, it's her responsibility and her body. He can't force her to abort, and by giving an ultimatum, he's taking away her choice. So even if he's not legally at fault, ethically he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo the answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong. He's not respecting her decision-making power over her body, and using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship if she doesn't comply is manipulative.\n"
