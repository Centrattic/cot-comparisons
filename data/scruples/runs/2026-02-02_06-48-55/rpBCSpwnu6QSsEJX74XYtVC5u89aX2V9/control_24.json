Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, and they've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant despite being on the pill. The author thought the pill was over 99% effective, so he didn't use backup. But she admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because of her vacation and schedule. The author feels she should have told him they needed to use condoms or stop having sex. Then when the pregnancy happens, he's upset and eventually asks her to abort, saying he's not ready and can't support a child, and if she wants to keep it, he can't stay with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side, he's 18, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and not financially stable. His girlfriend is 20, a university student, also dependent on loans. They both don't have the resources for a baby. He believes that she didn't inform him about her contraceptive issues, which he sees as her responsibility. He's making a hard decision because he's not ready for parenthood and can't support a child financially.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend is on the pill, which requires daily intake. She admits she wasn't taking it properly. But is that an excuse? The author might think she should have been more responsible, but maybe she faced challenges, like stress from university, that made it harder. Also, the birth control pill can be tricky if not taken consistently, which he might not have considered. The author's reaction\u2014threatening to leave if she keeps the baby\u2014could be seen as pressuring her to abort. Even if he's not ready, the decision to abort is a major one, and he's putting a lot of pressure on her by making it a condition for staying in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: reproductive rights. The decision to have an abortion is typically up to the pregnant person. By pressuring her to abort, the author is taking away her autonomy. Even if he's not in favor of the pregnancy, he shouldn't be the one deciding her medical choices. This could be a significant issue here. Also, the fact that he's 18 and she's 20\u2014though both are adults, the power dynamics in the relationship might play a role. He's making a decision that affects both of them, but especially her.\n\nThe author might feel that he's being realistic about their situation, but he's not considering her feelings and her right to make her own choice. Even if she didn't handle the contraception properly, he's now imposing his decision on her. The key point here is that the woman has the final say on whether to terminate the pregnancy. The author might not be wrong in feeling shocked and overwhelmed, but pressuring her to abort could be wrong because it's her body and her decision.\n\nAdditionally, the initial assumption that the pill is over 99% effective might be misleading. The pill's effectiveness can drop if not taken correctly, like missing a dose. Maybe the author should have used backup, but he didn't. However, the responsibility for contraception isn't solely on the woman. Both partners should communicate about their methods. In this case, the girlfriend didn't inform him of her irregular pill use, which he now sees as a failure on her part. But maybe she didn't want to admit that she wasn't taking it properly, or she thought it was under control.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect his future and theirs by not having a child, which is understandable. But the way he's approaching it\u2014by making the abortion a condition to stay in the relationship\u2014could be seen as coercive. Even if he's not ready, he's not respecting her autonomy. The correct approach would be to support her decision, whether she chooses to keep the baby or not, instead of pressuring her to abort to stay with him.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to abort, which is her decision to make. Even if there are valid reasons for not wanting a child, the decision should be hers, and he shouldn't use their relationship as leverage. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
