Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author is 18 and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, and he's upset because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking it properly. He feels she should have used backup protection or stopped having sex. When she tells him she's pregnant, he reacts by saying he's not ready and that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her. He gives her an ultimatum: abortion or him leaving, and he's willing to provide financial support if she chooses to be a single mom but not if she wants to stay with him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is making a demand that his girlfriend end the pregnancy. The girlfriend is the one who would have to physically go through the abortion. Ethically, this is a major decision, and typically, the pregnant person has the right to make that choice. By pressuring her to have an abortion, the author is essentially taking away her autonomy. Even if he's not forcing her physically, emotionally pressuring her to make a decision that affects her body is problematic.\n\nAlso, his reasoning is that she didn't take the pill properly. But the responsibility for contraception isn't solely on the woman. Even if she was on the pill, it's a shared responsibility. The author didn't use backup protection either. So he's placing the blame on her, which isn't entirely fair. The effectiveness of the pill can be affected by various factors, including stress, illness, or interactions with other medications. The fact that she mentioned her schedule during vacation might be a legitimate reason for missed pills, and expecting her to be perfect in her pill-taking is unrealistic.\n\nMoreover, his ultimatum is essentially saying that their relationship can't survive having a child. That's a serious stance, especially given their young age and current life situations. But he's making a judgment about her ability to handle the pregnancy and is dictating her choices. This could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy and her wishes.\n\nIn many places, the legal right to an abortion is a matter of the individual's choice, and the partner cannot make that decision for them. So even if the author believes it's for the best, the decision should ultimately rest with the pregnant person. The fact that he's pressuring her to have the abortion, rather than supporting her in whatever choice she makes, suggests that he's in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant. She's already dealing with the stress of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential loss of her partner. By giving her such a difficult choice, he's adding to her emotional burden. The author's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of fear and uncertainty, are not supportive and instead put the responsibility solely on her to conform to his readiness for parenthood.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014autonomy, shared responsibility, emotional pressure, and the right of the pregnant person to make the decision\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
