Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, the girlfriend is 20, they've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's angry that she didn't use backup protection and didn't inform him about missing pills. He feels she should have communicated better. Now he's telling her he's not ready for a baby and that if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her, offering financial support if she becomes a single mom.\n\nSo, the key points here: communication breakdown, responsibility for contraception, and the pressure to abort. The boyfriend is taking a stance that the decision to abort is necessary for the relationship to continue. But is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if one is on the pill, it's a shared responsibility. The girlfriend had a valid reason for missing pills\u2014uni vacation disrupting her schedule. She might not have realized the impact or felt comfortable discussing it. The boyfriend didn't check in with her about the pill, assuming she was handling it. That's a gap in communication.\n\nNow, when she tells him she's pregnant, his reaction is anger and a sense of betrayal. He's placing blame on her for not taking the pill properly and not communicating. This approach could be hurtful. Instead of working together to find a solution, he's making an ultimatum. Ultimatums in such sensitive situations can be damaging. It's important to support each other and consider all options together, not impose decisions.\n\nHe mentions that he loves her and the baby but isn't ready. The pressure to abort might stem from his fears and current life circumstances, but it's not the other person's responsibility to carry a pregnancy if it's not desired. However, forcing her to abort isn't right either. The decision should be mutual, respecting each other's wishes. If she wants to keep the baby, he's choosing to end the relationship rather than support her. That's a significant decision, but it's also a reflection of his inability to handle responsibility and his unwillingness to support her choice. \n\nIt's possible he's scared and overwhelmed, but the way he's handling it is problematic. He's not taking responsibility for the lack of backup contraception, is blaming her, and is making a decision that affects her body and future. That's where the wrong lies. He should consider her autonomy and work together on a solution rather than placing the burden solely on her. The fact that he's 18 and still in an apprenticeship might mean he's not in a position to handle a child, but he's still making a decision that impacts someone else's life choices. \n\nIn summary, while both may have contributed to the situation, the boyfriend's approach\u2014blaming, ultimatums, and lack of shared responsibility\u2014makes him at fault. He should have communicated better, used backup protection, and supported her in making a mutual decision rather than dictating her choice.\n"
