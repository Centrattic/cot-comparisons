Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy is asking his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion because she got pregnant while on the pill. He's upset because he thought the pill was over 99% effective, and he feels she should have used backup contraception or told him she wasn't taking the pill properly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is young, in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and not in a position to support a child. His argument is that the responsibility was on the girlfriend to manage her contraception and inform him if it wasn't working. On the other hand, the girlfriend is 20, on vacation, and mentions she had trouble taking the pill properly because her schedule was off. She didn't use backup protection, but maybe she thought the pill was enough.\n\nNow, in terms of responsibility, both partners should be aware of contraception. Even though the pill is effective when taken correctly, it's not foolproof. So, maybe expecting her to take it perfectly every day is a bit much, especially with a changed schedule. However, she didn't communicate her difficulties with him. That's a point against her. But the guy didn't suggest using a condom either. It's a shared responsibility.\n\nThen there's the question of the abortion. The guy is pressuring her to have one because he's not ready. But the decision to have an abortion should be hers to make. He's saying he won't stay with her if she chooses to keep the baby. That's a big ultimatum. Even if he's not ready, he's imposing his decision on her, which might be controlling. She has the right to choose what to do with her body. \n\nHe also mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him about her pill usage. But she did admit she knew it was risky. Still, communication is key in a relationship. However, the ultimatum he's giving her could be seen as him forcing her decision. Even if he's not in the position to support a child, the choice isn't his to make. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend might have some responsibility in not using backup or communicating her pill issues, the guy is putting pressure on her to make a decision that's not entirely his to control. The fact that he's giving her an ultimatum and not supporting her choice to keep the baby might make him in the wrong. The key point here is that reproductive decisions are the woman's choice, and pressuring her for an abortion could be considered wrong, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
