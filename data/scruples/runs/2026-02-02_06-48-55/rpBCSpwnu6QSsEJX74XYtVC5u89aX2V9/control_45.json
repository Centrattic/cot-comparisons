Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, and the author is 18. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which she wasn't taking properly because of her schedule during university vacation. The author feels she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop having sex. He didn't know she was missing pills, and now he's asking her to have an abortion because he's not ready for a child and they can't support a baby financially.\n\nNow, the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for pressuring her into an abortion. The girlfriend is considering the baby but isn't sure. The author is saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby and is offering financial support if she becomes a single mom. This is a major life decision affecting both of them.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the woman has the legal right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue the pregnancy. The author is essentially making her choice for her by saying he won't stay with her if she keeps the baby. That could be seen as coercive. Even if he's not forcing her, he's putting pressure on her to terminate the pregnancy to maintain the relationship. That's a significant power dynamic, especially in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready, which is valid. However, he's placing the burden on her to solve their predicament. He also accuses her of being irresponsible because she didn't use the pill properly. But she admitted that her schedule messed up her pill intake. It's possible she didn't realize the risk or didn't want to confront the relationship about condoms. Still, the contraceptive method was her responsibility, but the author didn't offer alternative protection either.\n\nAnother angle: the author is 18, still in an apprenticeship, and financially dependent. However, by pressuring her to abort, he's avoiding responsibility. The pregnancy is a joint responsibility, even if the contraceptive failure was on her side. The author is not offering to step up (like supporting the child if she keeps it) beyond a minimal financial contribution. His ultimatum could be seen as shirking his part in the situation.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect. He's upset and conflicted, but making her choose between the baby and him is a heavy burden. This could lead to resentment and trauma. Even if he's not forcing her, the pressure to abort because of the threat to their relationship is problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally considered that the pregnant person should have autonomy over their pregnancy. The partner shouldn't dictate the decision. So even if the author is not happy, he can't force her choice. By making her choose between the baby and him, he's infringing on her autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion for his own reasons, effectively making her decision for her, and not taking responsibility. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
