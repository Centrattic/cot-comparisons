Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a 18-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman who has been on the pill but missed doses due to her schedule. The man feels she should have used backup contraception and is upset that she didn't tell him, leading him to demand an abortion or lose her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately up to the pregnant person. Even if the partner is involved, they don't have the authority to make that choice. The man's insistence on the abortion could be seen as coercive, which is a serious issue.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. The woman is expressing openness to keeping the baby but hasn't made a clear decision. The man is placing the burden of the decision on her, essentially saying he can't be part of the relationship if she chooses to keep it. This could be seen as putting her in a position where she feels forced to abort to maintain the relationship. That's a form of emotional manipulation or pressure.\n\nAlso, the man's argument that it's her fault for not handling contraception properly is problematic. Both partners share responsibility in a relationship. Even if the woman missed pills, the expectation that she communicated that to him is valid, but his response is extreme. He's not taking responsibility for not using a backup method himself, which was his choice.\n\nThe man's ultimatum is harsh. He's giving her two options: abort or lose him. This doesn't consider her autonomy and emotional state. The fact that he's 18 and she's 20 might also play into societal expectations, but age alone doesn't excuse his actions.\n\nHowever, his concerns about being unprepared for parenthood are valid. But instead of pressuring for an abortion, a more mature approach would be to discuss options together, support each other, and seek counseling. His reaction seems to stem from panic and a lack of readiness, but that doesn't justify coercion.\n\nIn summary, the man's actions are ethically wrong because he's pressuring the woman to make a life-altering decision under the threat of losing the relationship. He's not respecting her autonomy, and his ultimatum is coercive. Even if he's not ready, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers to make. The fact that he's placing the blame solely on her and not taking shared responsibility is another point against his position.\n"
