Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old guy who's dating a 20-year-old girl. They've been together seven months, and she got pregnant. She's on the pill, but she missed doses because of her university vacation schedule. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him to stop having sex. Now he's pressuring her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready for a baby and can't support it financially. She wants to keep the baby but doesn't want to lose him, so he's giving her an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right. Legally, the man doesn't have the authority to pressure her into making that choice. The woman has autonomy over her body. Even if he's not ready, the burden of the decision shouldn't fall on her, but he's making it a condition for staying in the relationship.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. He's using the relationship as leverage, which can be manipulative. Telling her he can't stay with her if she has the baby is putting her in a tough spot. She's already stressed about the pregnancy and her academic situation. His ultimatum might be seen as controlling and not respecting her agency.\n\nAlso, contraception responsibility isn't solely on one person. He trusted the pill was effective, but she might have thought the same. It's a shared responsibility. He's blaming her for not taking the pill correctly, but he didn't insist on backup methods either. So maybe both share some responsibility.\n\nHe's also not considering her feelings and options. She mentioned being open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. He's pushing for an abortion, which is a big decision. Her emotional state is important here, and he's making her feel like it's her fault, which isn't fair. The fact that he's pressuring her to abort while acknowledging it breaks his heart shows a conflict, but he's not considering her feelings as much.\n\nFinancially, they're both students, so resources are limited. He's not ready, but the decision shouldn't be based on his readiness alone. The woman has her own life and future to consider. His ultimatum removes her options, which is problematic because it's her body and her future.\n\nLooking at the ethical side, the author is in a position where he's trying to control the outcome of a situation that primarily affects the woman's life. Even if he's not ready for a child, the choice to terminate a pregnancy is hers, not his. By making her choose between the baby and him, he's exerting pressure that's not appropriate. It's a form of emotional manipulation, which can be considered wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's also young and not in a position to be a parent. But that doesn't justify pressuring her. He could be supporting her in making her own decision, regardless of the outcome. His approach is more about self-preservation and not about respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring the woman to have an abortion, which is her decision, and using their relationship as a condition for that decision. He's not respecting her autonomy and is placing blame on her instead of sharing responsibility. The correct answer should be A.\n"
