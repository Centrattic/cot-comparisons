Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is about a young couple in their early 20s dealing with an unplanned pregnancy. The boyfriend, who's 18, is asking if he's at fault for suggesting an abortion. The girlfriend is 20 and they've been dating for seven months. She was on the pill, but she missed taking it because of her vacation schedule. The guy feels she should have communicated better and used backup protection, and he's pressuring her to have an abortion if she doesn't want to lose him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibility in relationships when it comes to contraception. Both partners usually share responsibility. The girl was on the pill, but she admits she wasn't taking it properly. The guy expected her to be on the pill, which is effective when used correctly, but he didn't suggest using a condom as backup. So maybe he's partially at fault for not discussing the limitations of the pill and not ensuring they had protection. However, the girl did know the risks but didn't communicate her situation. \n\nNow, the main issue is the pressure to have an abortion. The author is saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby, which is putting her in a difficult position. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but might not be sure. The guy is making her choice dependent on their relationship, which could be coercive. Even if he's not ready for a child, forcing her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes would be wrong. The article mentions she's open to keeping the baby, but the author is pressuring her towards abortion. That might be the key point here. \n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, both are in university and have limited resources. The guy is 18, which is still a young age, and he might not be emotionally mature enough to handle this situation. However, the pressure he's exerting on the girlfriend to terminate the pregnancy could be seen as selfish or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nAnother angle is consent. If the girlfriend is considering alternatives but the author is not supporting her choice to carry the baby, he's not respecting her autonomy. He's essentially giving her an ultimatum: abort or lose him. That's a form of emotional manipulation. Even if he's not ready for a child, making her decision about her own body contingent on his willingness to stay in the relationship is problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The girlfriend didn't communicate her missed pills, but the author didn't check in or offer alternative protection. Both have responsibilities here. However, the main issue is the author's response\u2014pressuring her to abort. That seems more severe than the initial contraceptive failure. \n\nIn terms of societal views, opinions might differ. Some might see him as realistic about their situation, others as not taking responsibility for his share of the problem. But ethically, pressuring a partner for an abortion, especially if she's open to keeping the baby, is a big no. He's not allowing her to make her own decision without being influenced by the threat of losing the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his partner for an abortion, not respecting her autonomy, and making her decision about her own body dependent on his presence in the relationship. Even if he's not ready for a child, he should support her decision rather than forcing her to terminate. The initial contraceptive issue is a shared responsibility, but the ultimatum is where he crosses into being in the wrong.\n"
