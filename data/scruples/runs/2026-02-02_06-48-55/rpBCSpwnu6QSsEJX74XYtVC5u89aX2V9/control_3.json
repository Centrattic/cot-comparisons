Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old man in a seven-month relationship with his 20-year-old girlfriend. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because she didn't use backup protection and now is pregnant. He feels she should have told him they needed to stop having sex or use condoms when she wasn't on the pill properly. They both are in university, he's on an apprenticeship with a small wage, she's on student loans. They can't handle having a baby. He told her he doesn't want the baby and that if she wants to keep it, they can't be together. He offered to support her financially if she chooses to be a single mom but only if she aborts can they stay together. He's torn because he loves her but can't handle a child right now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, abortion decisions are typically the woman's choice. The man can't legally force her to have an abortion. So by demanding she abort the baby to stay with him, he's putting pressure on her, which might be problematic. Even if he's not forcing her, pressuring her to make a decision that she might not be comfortable with could be seen as wrong. \n\nThen there's the responsibility aspect. Both partners are supposed to be responsible for contraception. While the girlfriend was on the pill, it's true that it's her responsibility to take it correctly. However, using backup methods like condoms is also a shared responsibility. He might be right in pointing out that she didn't manage her contraception properly, but he's also not entirely blame-free if they didn't use backup methods. \n\nEmotionally, the situation is complex. He's young, not financially stable, and not ready for a child. His decision is based on his inability to handle the situation, which is understandable. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014telling her she has to abort to stay with him\u2014could be seen as pressuring her into a decision she's not ready for. It might make her feel like the pregnancy is entirely her fault, which isn't fair because both should have taken precautions. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and shared responsibility. The author is pressuring his partner to make an abortion decision that isn't legally or ethically his to make. Even if he's not forcing her, the ultimatum he's giving (abort or we break up) is placing the burden solely on her. That's problematic because her decision should be hers alone. Additionally, the fact that he's not willing to support her if she chooses to keep the baby, despite offering financial help, shows a lack of commitment to a shared responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a position to support a child, which is a valid concern. But the way he's handling the situation might show a lack of empathy and understanding. The girlfriend's feelings and her autonomy are crucial here. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of his own feelings about not being ready, but in terms of respecting her autonomy and not pressuring her into abortion, he's in the wrong.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring his partner into an abortion decision that she should make herself, and he's not taking shared responsibility for the situation, even though both could have done more to prevent the pregnancy.\n"
