Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is young, in their early 20s, both in university. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she didn't take it properly because she was on vacation and not on her normal schedule. The guy is upset that she didn't inform him they might be at risk and didn't use backup like condoms. He feels she should have taken responsibility for her contraception. When she gets pregnant, he's shocked and not ready for a baby. He asks her to have an abortion, saying that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't be with her. She's upset, and he feels bad but stands by his decision.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the guy is young, not financially stable, and in an apprenticeship. He's worried about the responsibilities of parenthood. He's also upset that the girlfriend didn't manage her contraception properly. On the other hand, the girlfriend is also in a university setting, on student loans, and living in student housing. She might not have the means to support a child either. The fact that she didn't take the pill correctly is a key point here. The guy expects her to handle contraception properly, but maybe he should have used a backup method himself. Contraception is a shared responsibility, right? So if she wasn't taking the pill correctly, maybe he could have suggested using condoms as backup. But he didn't, so he might share some responsibility.\n\nThe guy is asking her to have an abortion, which is a major decision that only she can make. He's essentially giving her an ultimatum: abort the baby or lose him. That seems really harsh, especially since she's open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. By setting this condition, he's pressuring her into a choice that might not be what she truly wants. Even if he's not ready to be a parent, forcing her to abort could be seen as controlling her reproductive choices. Also, he's threatening to leave if she doesn't comply, which is a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his readiness and financial situation. He's not in a position to support a child, so maybe his stance is legitimate. However, the problem is that he's making her choice for her instead of supporting her in whatever decision she makes. The key issue here is consent and autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make her own decision about her body and pregnancy. By pressuring her to abort, even if he's not ready, he's infringing on her autonomy. \n\nMoreover, the guy's reaction of being angry and feeling tricked because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill correctly is problematic. She might have thought she could manage it, but when things go wrong, he's holding her responsible. But in reality, both partners should be involved in contraception. Maybe using a dual method (like the pill and condoms) would have been better. His anger at her for not being perfect in taking the pill is understandable, but it's also a shared responsibility.\n\nIn terms of emotional impact, he's causing her a lot of distress. He mentions that she's upset, but he still stands by his decision. That's not supportive. A healthy relationship should involve mutual support and open communication, not ultimatums. His ultimatum is not only pressuring her but also putting their relationship at risk. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the situation is complex and both have valid points about their readiness and circumstances, the author is making a decision that affects his girlfriend's body and future without her full consent. By setting an ultimatum, he's pressuring her into an abortion, which is a major ethical issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
