Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 18-year-old guy is asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend, who is 20, to have an abortion after she gets pregnant. They've been dating seven months and weren't using backup contraception because she was on the pill. The girl said she missed doses during university vacation, which led to the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy feels unprepared financially and emotionally for a child. He's in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and she's on student loans. They both don't have the resources for a baby. He's upset because he thought the pill was reliable and that she should have taken responsibility for her contraception. He ends up telling her if she wants the baby, they can't stay together.\n\nOn the girl's side, she's on the pill, which is 99% effective, but missing doses can cause it to be less effective. She might not have realized the risk or thought she was being responsible. She didn't mention needing condoms, which is a point of contention. However, she's also in a position where she might not be ready for a baby either. She's open to keeping it but doesn't say if she wants to. The guy is pressuring her to abort to stay with him.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should share responsibility for contraception. The guy's argument is that she didn't communicate her missed doses, which is valid. But the girl might not have considered the consequences of missing pills, especially during a time when her schedule is disrupted. However, it's not entirely her fault if she thought the pill was sufficient.\n\nThe guy's response is to ultimatum: abortion or no relationship. That's a heavy decision to place on someone, especially when the pregnancy wasn't entirely her fault. The girl might not be ready to be a single mom, but the guy is taking away her choice by making it a condition of their relationship. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the guy is young, 18, and might not fully understand the emotional and physical impact of an abortion on the girl. The fact that he says the idea of abortion breaks his heart but still insists on it shows a lack of empathy. He's prioritizing his own unpreparedness over her choice and well-being. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the couple is both underage in many places (depending on the country, 18 might be the age of consent). However, the bigger issue is the pressure on the girl to terminate a pregnancy, which is a significant decision. The guy isn't considering her feelings beyond how it affects their relationship. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the guy is placing the burden solely on the girl for a situation that both might have contributed to. Even if she was responsible for taking the pill, he should have been involved in the conversation about contraception. His ultimatum is a form of emotional pressure that doesn't respect her autonomy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
