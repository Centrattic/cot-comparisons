Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is young, in university, both financially unstable. The girlfriend is on the pill but missed doses during her vacation, leading to pregnancy. The author feels she should have used a backup method or communicated better. He then demands an abortion, threatening to leave if she doesn't.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The author is taking a hardline stance, implying the responsibility is solely on his girlfriend for missing her pill. However, in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if she missed doses, he might have considered using a backup method like condoms, which he didn't mention doing. \n\nAlso, his ultimatum\u2014either abortion and stay together or she can be a single mom\u2014is a significant pressure tactic. While he's not ready for a child, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers, not his to dictate. The fact that he's offering financial support only if she aborts adds another layer of coercion. \n\nMoreover, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is clear. She's upset, and the author acknowledges feeling like an asshole but still insists on his terms. This shows a lack of empathy and a failure to consider her autonomy and feelings.\n\nSo, while the author's concerns about their readiness to be parents are valid, the way he's handling the situation\u2014placing blame, making ultimatums, and not sharing responsibility\u2014points to him being in the wrong. The situation requires mutual respect and shared decision-making, which he hasn't demonstrated.\n"
