Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's an 18-year-old guy in a seven-month relationship with a 20-year-old girlfriend. She got pregnant while on the pill, and he's asking her to have an abortion. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is young, in an apprenticeship, not in a position to support a child financially. He's living with his parents, she's on student loans. They both seem to be in a situation where a baby would be a huge burden. He's upset because he thought she was on the pill, which he believes is over 99% effective. But she admitted she wasn't taking it properly. He feels tricked because she didn't tell him about missing pills and the risk, which makes him feel like she didn't communicate properly.\n\nOn the other hand, she's 20, an adult, and responsible for her own contraception. She should have been taking the pill correctly, and if she wasn't, she should have used a backup method. By not doing so, she put both of them in a difficult situation. However, the guy is pressuring her to abort, which is a major decision for her. He's saying that if she doesn't do it, he can't stay with her. That seems really harsh. He's putting the burden of the decision solely on her, which is a lot to ask. Also, he's making it conditional on their relationship, which might be emotionally coercive.\n\nBut then again, he's not in a position to support a child, and he's honest about his feelings. He's not forcing her to abort, but he's making it clear that if she doesn't, he can't be with her. That's a tough spot for her. She might feel pressured to abort because of his ultimatum, which could be seen as selfish, but he's also in a vulnerable position himself.\n\nI think the key points here are about shared responsibility. Both are adults and should have been using contraception correctly. She didn't take the pill properly, which is on her, but he didn't check if she was using it correctly or suggest a backup method. However, he's now asking her to abort, which is a significant decision. Pressuring her to have an abortion because of financial or life circumstances might be seen as unfair, especially if he's using the relationship as leverage. It's possible he's in the wrong because he's making her carry the burden of the decision and the emotional fallout, even though part of the responsibility lies with her for not managing contraception properly.\n\nBut there's also the argument that he's being honest about his inability to parent, which is a valid point. He's not forcing her to abort; he's just stating his position. However, the way he's framed it as an ultimatum might be problematic. The question is whether it's his place to dictate her decision about her own body. Legally and ethically, the decision to have an abortion is hers to make, and pressuring her could be seen as controlling. So even if he's not ready, he shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body. He's in a position where he's not taking responsibility for the situation but instead shifting the burden onto her. That makes me think he's in the wrong.\n"
