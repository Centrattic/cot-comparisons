Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA for asking my girlfriend to have an abortion?) is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She gets pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses. He expects her to have used backup methods. He feels tricked because she didn't tell him about the missed pills and then didn't use condoms. Now, he wants her to have an abortion and says he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby. He offers financial support if she becomes a single mom but insists on an abortion if she wants to stay with him. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the responsibility of contraception. The pill is 99% effective with perfect use, but she missed doses. The user is arguing that she should have taken better care of her birth control. But in reality, both partners have a role in contraception, even if one is using a method. If she's on the pill, it's her method, but if she's not taking it properly, maybe it's her fault. However, he could have suggested using condoms as backup. He didn't, so part of the blame might fall on him. \n\nThen, when she tells him she's pregnant, he reacts with anger and shock. He didn't check if she was taking her pill correctly. The argument is whether he has the right to pressure her into an abortion. He's 18, not legally an adult in many places (depends on the country), and she's 20. Legally, in some places, he might have parental rights depending on the jurisdiction. But ethically, he's not the one carrying the child, so the decision should be hers. However, he's making a condition that if she wants to stay with him, she must abort. That seems to take away her autonomy.\n\nHe says he loves her and the baby but can't handle the situation. But by making the choice to end it or lose him, he's forcing her to choose between her relationship and her pregnancy. That's a huge pressure. Even if he's not ready, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers to make. He can't impose that choice on her. \n\nAlso, he's suggesting financial support if she becomes a single mom, but the terms are that if she wants to stay with him, she must abort. That seems like a manipulative tactic. He's not taking responsibility for the situation. If they were both using contraception properly, this wouldn't have happened. But he didn't take any backup measures, so maybe part of the fault is on him. \n\nHe's young and not in a financial position to support a child. That's valid, but his approach is to force the decision on her. The key here is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion. Since the decision to have an abortion is ultimately the woman's, and he's using their relationship as a lever, that's problematic. He's not considering her wishes beyond his own. \n\nAlso, she mentioned being open to keeping the baby but didn't clarify her own feelings. He's not respecting her autonomy in that case. Even if she's unsure, he's making the choice for her. That's a major issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion, not taking responsibility for his own role in the lack of contraception, and using their relationship as a condition for the pregnancy decision. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
