Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's against continuing the pregnancy because they're both young, in university, and can't handle the responsibilities. He feels she should have used better contraception, like condoms, since she wasn't taking the pill correctly. He's giving her an ultimatum: abortion or he leaves.\n\nNow, looking at the ethical aspects. Both are minors (18 and 20 are adults in many places, but still very young). They're not in a stable financial situation. The girl might not be taking full responsibility, but the man is also making a decision that affects her body. The key point here is that the decision to have an abortion should ultimately be the woman's choice. Even if he feels she was irresponsible, pressuring her to abort goes against her autonomy.\n\nHe's putting her in a position where her choice is either lose the baby or lose him. That's manipulating her by tying her reproductive decision to their relationship. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate. The fact that he's willing to pay child support if she keeps the baby shows he's not holding her fully accountable for the child's care, but he's using the abortion as a condition to stay in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the girl admitted she might not be on the pill correctly, but he expected her to use backup. However, it's a shared responsibility. Maybe they should have used dual protection. But even so, the pressure is on him to make a decision that's not his to make. The girl's right to her own body is paramount here. So, the man is wrong for pressuring her into an abortion, regardless of his reasoning.\n"
