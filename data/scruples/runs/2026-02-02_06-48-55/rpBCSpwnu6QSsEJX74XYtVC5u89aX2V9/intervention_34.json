Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for pressuring their girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the couple is young, both in their early 20s, and not in a stable financial or living situation. The girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is upset because he believes she didn't manage her contraception properly. He then tells her he can't stay with her unless she aborts the baby, which is a significant ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Contraception is a shared responsibility. While the girlfriend was on the pill, she admitted she wasn't taking it consistently. However, the author didn't ensure they were using backup methods. Both have a role in preventing pregnancy.\n\nWhen the pregnancy happens, the author reacts by placing the blame entirely on his girlfriend and setting an ultimatum. This seems unfair because it's a joint decision. He's not considering her autonomy in the decision-making process. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, which indicates she might be willing to go that route, but the author is not giving her that option without pressure. \n\nThe ultimatum\u2014either abort the baby or lose the relationship\u2014imposes his decision on her. It's not a collaborative discussion about their future. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have equal say in such a major life decision. By making it conditional on her agreeing to an abortion, he's not respecting her potential wishes and is coercing her. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that it's her fault for not handling contraception properly ignores the shared responsibility. Even if the pill failed, they should have used another method. The author's anger and the ultimatum come across as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author is not in the wrong in the sense that he's not obligated to be a parent if he's not ready. However, the way he's approaching the situation\u2014blaming his partner, setting a coercive ultimatum, and not engaging in a mutual decision\u2014makes him at fault. The question isn't just about whether he's right to not want the baby, but about how he's handling the situation. \n\nThe correct answer here is A, because the author is pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision without mutual discussion and is not respecting her autonomy, which is a significant ethical issue.\n"
