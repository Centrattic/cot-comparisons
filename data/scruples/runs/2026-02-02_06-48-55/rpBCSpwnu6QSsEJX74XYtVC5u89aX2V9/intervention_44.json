Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, the girlfriend 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, but it turns out she wasn't taking it properly on vacation. The key points here: she didn't use back-up protection, didn't tell him about missing pills, and he feels she should have communicated that. He then pressures her to have an abortion to stay with him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. From the boyfriend's perspective, he's young, not financially stable, and feels this isn't the right time for a baby. He might believe that she didn't take responsibility in managing contraception, expecting him to handle the situation. But from the girlfriend's side, she's taking the pill, which is supposed to be effective, and maybe she didn't realize the risk or thought it was low. She might feel blindsided and that he's placing all the blame on her.\n\nImportant to consider consent and autonomy. The boyfriend is pressuring her to abort, which is a significant decision. Even if he's not ready, it's her body and her choice. He's using the threat of losing the relationship if she doesn't comply, which seems manipulative. He's putting her in a situation where she's forced to choose between her career, financial stability, and her relationship.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's anger about her not informing him about the pill usage suggests he could have been more proactive in their contraception. Maybe they should have discussed back-up methods regardless of the pill. His reaction of threatening to leave if she doesn't abort is harsh and could be seen as selfish, not considering her autonomy and potential desires for the pregnancy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have roles. She didn't take the pill as intended, but he might have assumed it was foolproof. However, expecting her to handle all contraception without any communication or back-up is part of the problem. His approach to resolving it by forcing an abortion is where he's likely in the wrong. It's her decision, and he shouldn't be pressuring her like that. So I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
