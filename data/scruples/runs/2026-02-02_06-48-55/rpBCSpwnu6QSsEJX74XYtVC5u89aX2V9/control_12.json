Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, the situation: He's 18, she's 20, they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant despite being on the pill. He feels she should have used backup protection and didn't inform him about her missed pills. He's not ready for a child and tells her he won't stay with her if she keeps the baby. He's offering financial support if she chooses to have the baby but wants her to abort so they can stay together.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately the woman's. The man isn't the legal parent and can't force her to have one. By pressuring her to abort, he's making her decision contingent on their relationship. That's problematic because it's essentially holding their relationship hostage. Even if he's not ready, the choice should be hers. Also, he's suggesting he won't stay with her if she keeps the baby, which adds emotional pressure. \n\nAnother point: The woman admitted she might not have taken the pill correctly, but the responsibility isn't solely hers. They both have a role in contraception. However, the man's reaction is to shift blame and make it her fault, which isn't fair. Relationships require mutual responsibility. \n\nHe's in a position where he's not financially stable, but that's a personal situation. However, he's not in a position to dictate her medical decisions. His argument that she didn't inform him about the risk is valid, but it doesn't justify pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact: He's causing her emotional distress by making her choose between the baby and the relationship. That's a heavy burden and can be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion for his own benefit, not hers. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is hers alone, and he's not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, he has no right to force her to make that decision. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
