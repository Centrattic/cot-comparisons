Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's not ready for a child. He's in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and mentions financial instability. She's on student loans and has student housing. They both seem unprepared for parenthood. The author is upset because she didn't use the pill correctly, even though he thought it was 99% effective. He feels she should have used a backup method or stopped having sex. When she tells him she's pregnant, he's shocked and angry, and later tells her he's not ready and can't support a child, so if she wants to keep the baby, she can't stay with him.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and consent. The decision to have an abortion is a major one and should be the woman's choice. The author is pressuring her to have the abortion, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, he shouldn't force her decision. He's essentially giving her an ultimatum: abortion or no relationship. That's a heavy burden. It's possible he's feeling overwhelmed and responsible, but he's not the one carrying the child. The fact that she's open to keeping it but he's telling her she can't stay with him might be the issue here. Also, he's mentioning financial support if she chooses to be a single mom, which might be a way to avoid responsibility but still control the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young, and both are in a position where they can't provide for a child. But that doesn't mean he can dictate her choices. The responsibility for contraception isn't solely on her; maybe they should have used a backup method. However, he's also not taking responsibility by saying it's not his fault. So, there's a mix of factors. The main problem is the ultimatum. Pressuring a partner to have an abortion against her wishes can be considered wrong because it infringes on her right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into a decision that isn't his to make. The answer should be A.\n"
