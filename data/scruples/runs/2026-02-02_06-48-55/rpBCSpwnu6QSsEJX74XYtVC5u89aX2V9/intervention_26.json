Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author, who is the guy in the situation, is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, the setup: They're both young, in university, have limited financial resources. The girlfriend is on the pill but missed taking it due to her schedule during vacation. She didn't use backup contraception. The guy found out she's pregnant and is upset because he feels she didn't take responsibility for the contraception. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby, and if she wants to keep it, he won't stay with her. He's offering financial support if she wants to be a single mom but insists on an abortion to stay together.\n\nSo, from my understanding, the key points here are about responsibility, communication, and the ethical implications of pressuring someone to have an abortion. \n\nOn one hand, the guy feels he's not ready for parenthood and can't support a child financially. That's a valid concern. He's young, still in apprenticeship, living with parents. But the flip side is that he's making a decision about her body and her future. The girlfriend is old enough to know the risks of the pill, and she admitted she wasn't taking it properly. However, even if she was at fault, does that give him the right to pressure her into an abortion? \n\nContraception is a shared responsibility. While she was on the pill, both partners should have been aware of the possibility of failure and maybe used additional protection. But the guy didn't use a condom, relying solely on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. However, the pill's effectiveness can drop if not taken consistently, which she wasn't. So maybe both have some responsibility here.\n\nThe main ethical issue is that the decision to have an abortion is hers to make. Even if the guy feels it's the right choice for both of them, he's not the one carrying the child. Pressuring her to abort because he's not ready could be seen as controlling. Also, he's essentially ending the relationship if she doesn't comply, which adds emotional pressure. That's a heavy ultimatum to place on someone, especially in an emotionally charged situation.\n\nAnother angle: the guy is acknowledging that he loves the baby to some extent but feels they can't provide for it. But he's not willing to support her as a single mother either unless he can be part of the baby's life. That seems contradictory. He's offering financial support but only if she aborts, which might not be fair to her either.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral rights, in most places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The guy can offer his opinion and express his feelings, but he doesn't have the authority to dictate her choice. Pressuring her could be seen as wrong because it's her body, her future, and her health at stake. Even if he feels she was negligent, that's not a justification for controlling her reproductive decisions.\n\nSo putting it all together: while both might share some responsibility for not using additional protection, the guy is in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion and threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't comply. His actions are coercive and disregard her autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
