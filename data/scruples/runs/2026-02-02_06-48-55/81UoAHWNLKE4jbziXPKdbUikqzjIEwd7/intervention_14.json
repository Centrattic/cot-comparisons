Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The sister wanted a child that both she and her partner could be biologically related to, so she asked her brother for sperm. The author declined because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be just an uncle. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The author's reasons: he wants to have kids himself, doesn't want to give up the chance to be a father. The sister's side: she wants to start a family and has asked her brother, who is close to her. The author is not being forced, it's a request. But he's declining because of personal wishes. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own desires over a family member's request? That's a tricky question. On one hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to have a child, and the author is being asked to help. But on the other hand, the author has his own dreams of fatherhood. The author isn't being forced, so it's his choice. However, the sister might feel hurt because she expected support from her close sibling.\n\nThe author's reasoning might be seen as self-centered because he's using his own future plans as a reason to say no. However, it's also about personal values and what he's willing to sacrifice. The sister might feel that the author isn't considering her needs enough. But is it his responsibility to donate sperm? Probably not, since it's a personal decision. \n\nThe sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong. It's about personal choice. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if the sister is upset. However, the way he handled it might have been insensitive. Explaining his feelings and the reasons clearly is important. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. It's his body and his choice. The sister's needs are important, but the author's own aspirations are valid too. The core issue is about personal autonomy versus family expectations. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
