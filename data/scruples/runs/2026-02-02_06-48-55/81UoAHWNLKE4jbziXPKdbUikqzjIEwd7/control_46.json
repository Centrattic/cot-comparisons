Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is a gay man, 25, and his sister is a lesbian, 30. The sister wants to have a family and is asking him to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. He refuses because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle, and he's concerned about missing out on fatherhood. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, the key points here: The request is to donate sperm for his sister's family. The author is not in a position where he's being forced; he's making a personal choice. His reasoning is about wanting to have his own children, which is a valid desire. The sister wants to have a child with her partner, which is also valid. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is looking for a judgment based on the scenario. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the sister is in a situation where she wants to start a family, and her partner is using IVF, which is legal. On the other, the author is prioritizing his own future family plans. \n\nIs there an obligation here? Family members often help each other, but donating sperm is a significant personal decision. It's not something that's typically expected unless there's an explicit prior agreement. The author isn't being asked to give up his sperm forever; he can still use it later. However, the emotional aspect for him is about being a father versus being an uncle. \n\nThe sister might feel that her needs are being ignored, but the author is also dealing with his own fears and desires. The sister's accusations of selfishness might be valid in that he is prioritizing his own wishes, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. It's about personal boundaries and autonomy. \n\nIn many cases, people are free to decline such requests unless there's a legal or prior commitment. The author isn't causing harm directly; he's just saying no. The sister's upset is understandable, but his refusal isn't inherently selfish if it's based on his own life goals. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his own desires, which are valid. The sister's needs are important, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own dreams for hers.\n"
