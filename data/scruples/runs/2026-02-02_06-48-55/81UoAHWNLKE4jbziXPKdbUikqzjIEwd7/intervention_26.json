Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The author is gay, his sister is a lesbian, and they're close. The sister wants to have a baby using the author's sperm, so the child would be biologically related to both her and her wife. The author refuses because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle. He's worried about missing out on fatherhood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't being asked to give up anything permanent\u2014he can still use his sperm later. But he's choosing not to help because he wants to have his own kids. That's a personal decision. But the sister is upset, feeling rejected and like her needs aren't being considered.\n\nIs it selfish? Well, the author's reasons are valid. He has a desire to be a parent, which is a big part of his dream. On the other hand, his sister also has her own dream of having a child with her partner. Both have legitimate desires here, but the author is prioritizing his own. \n\nThe sister might feel that since they're close, he should sacrifice a bit for her. But it's not like he's refusing in a way that's harmful beyond his own choice. He's not obligated to donate sperm. The author isn't in a position where he's being forced; it's a personal choice. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his sister's feelings enough. He says he wants the best for her, but his refusal is causing her pain. Maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing alternatives or timelines where he could donate later. But he's made his decision based on his own priorities.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to donate sperm. His reasons are personal and relate to his own future. So the answer would be B\u2014he's not in the wrong. His decision is about his own life goals, even if it causes conflict.\n"
