Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is gay and his sister is also a lesbian. They're both close, and the sister wants to have a family. She's asking him to donate sperm so that both she and her wife can be genetically related to the child. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself but isn't in a position to have kids right now. He's worried that donating sperm would mean he's just an uncle, not a dad, and that's a big deal for him.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia. The author is struggling between his desire to help his sister and his own feelings about fatherhood. He knows he can donate and still have kids later, but he's not willing to give up the chance to be a father in his own right.\n\nHmm, is he in the wrong? Well, the sister has a valid need here. She's trying to build a family, and the author has the option to help. But on the other hand, the author's feelings are legitimate too. He's not the one who's going to be raising the child, so his emotional investment in being a father is understandable. Maybe there's a middle ground, but he's already said no.\n\nI think the key here is autonomy. The author isn't obligated to donate his sperm. It's his body, and he has the right to decide. However, the sister's perspective is that he's being selfish. But is it really selfish if he's prioritizing his own dreams? Or is he being self-centered when his sister's family needs his help?\n\nWait, the sister's wife is the one who would carry the child. The author's sperm would contribute genes, but he's not the one who's going to be the primary parent. He's already close to the sister, so maybe he's worried about not being able to be a full parent. But he's also a man who might face challenges in becoming a parent himself, which makes his hesitation valid.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I don't think so. He's making a personal choice based on his own desires and fears. It's not his responsibility to sacrifice his own potential parenthood for his sister's. But maybe he should have considered their disappointment more, or tried to find another solution. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing himself to donate and it's his body, he's not in the wrong. His feelings are valid. The sister might feel hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing his own needs.\n"
