Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The author is gay, 25, and the sister is a lesbian who wants to have a child with her partner. The sister asked the author to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author turned her down, explaining that they also want to be a father one day but don't want to be just an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be involved in raising someone else's child. They feel that donating sperm would mean their child is raised by someone else, which they find hurtful. They also mention practical issues like adoption and surrogacy not being legal in their country. They admitted that logically, they might be being unreasonable because they have the means to donate and help their sister, who they love and respect.\n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's asking her brother, who is close to her, to help her form a family. She might feel that this is a natural extension of their relationship, especially since they are both LGBTQ+. The author's refusal is causing her emotional distress, and she's accusing him of being selfish or having internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Is the author obligated to donate sperm? In most cases, no. Family members aren't required to help unless there's a prior agreement or legal obligation. The author has the right to set boundaries about their body and personal choices. However, the emotional impact on the sister is significant. The author is close to her, so their refusal is hurting her, which is understandable.\n\nThe author's reasons are personal and valid. Wanting to be a parent is a legitimate desire. However, the sister is in a situation where she's trying to build a family, which is also important. The conflict here is between personal desires and family obligations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own future as a parent, but they might be in the wrong if they don't acknowledge the sister's feelings and the impact of their refusal. The key is whether the refusal is justified given the personal reasons versus the sister's needs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and autonomy. The author is making a choice about their body, which is their right. However, the sister's disappointment is real, and the author could be seen as being selfish because they are prioritizing their own wishes over their sister's. But it's not necessarily wrong if the author isn't being forced to make that decision.\n\nAnother angle: the sister might have expected support from her brother, especially given their close relationship. The author's refusal, while understandable, might strain that relationship because it's a sensitive and personal issue. The author's admission that they might be selfish suggests internal conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid reason based on their own desire to be a parent, the situation is complicated by the potential harm caused to the sister. The answer hinges on balancing personal autonomy against family obligations. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are making a personal choice, but they might be seen as selfish depending on the context. However, given that the sister is using a different method (IVF with the author's sperm) and the author is not being forced, the answer is more about personal choice rather than being in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's decision is considered selfish in the context of their relationship. Since the author is making a choice that affects their sister's family-building plans, some might see it as them being in the wrong, but others might respect their autonomy. Given the information, the author's reasons are personal and valid, so they are not in the wrong.\n"
