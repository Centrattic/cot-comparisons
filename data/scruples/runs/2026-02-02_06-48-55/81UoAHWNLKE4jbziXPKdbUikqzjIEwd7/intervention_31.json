Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 25-year-old gay man. His sister, who is also a lesbian, is 30 and wants to start a family with her wife. She asked him to donate sperm so they can have a child. The author refused because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle. He feels that donating would mean giving up his chance to be a dad, even though he could do it later. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's reasons: he wants to be a father and not just a genetic donor. His sister's request is valid because she wants to have a biological child with her wife. The author is close to her and has supported her, but this request is personal for him. \n\nIs it wrong to say no? Well, the sister is in a position where they might have limited options (since surrogacy isn't legal in their country). The author has the ability to help, but he has his own dreams. The question is whether his refusal is selfish. The sister might feel hurt because she was expecting support from her brother. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't obligated to donate. He's not in a position where he has to do this. His feelings about wanting to be a father are valid. It's his body and his sperm. People can have different priorities here. \n\nThe sister's feelings are hurt, but does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. It's possible that his reasons are legitimate, even if the sister feels rejected. The author might not be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own future family, which is a personal choice. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of being close to the sister. If he's always been there for her, and now she asks for something that's important to her, maybe there's an expectation of support. However, that's a complex dynamic. The author isn't being asked to sacrifice his entire future, just his sperm. But it's a big deal for him. \n\nAnother angle: the sister is using the author's sperm to have a child, which would make the author a biological parent. But the author wants to be a social parent, not just a genetic one. That's a valid concern. He doesn't want to be an uncle; he wants to be a father. So, if he donates, he's giving up that possibility. \n\nThe sister might not have considered that the author has his own aspirations. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but personal desire. So, is that selfish? Maybe not. People can have different needs. However, the sister is in a situation where she might have limited options, and the author could have helped. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being selfish by prioritizing his own goals over his sister's. But since he's not in a position where he's required to help, and his reasons are personal, it's a tough call. Some might see him as in the wrong for not helping, while others see him as in the right for not sacrificing his own dreams. \n\nGiven that the author is not the only possible donor and the sister could explore other options (like using a sperm bank, even though it's more expensive), maybe his refusal isn't entirely his fault. But I'm not sure. The sister might not have those options, and the author's availability is a unique opportunity. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision is a personal choice. He's not wrong for prioritizing his own future family, even if it causes hurt feelings. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
