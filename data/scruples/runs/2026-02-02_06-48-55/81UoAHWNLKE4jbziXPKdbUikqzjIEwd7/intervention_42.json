Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is a lesbian married to another woman, and they want to have a child using the author's sperm via the sister-in-law. The author is gay, so they're both from a family where same-sex relationships are part of their lives. The author is close to their sister and feels conflicted because they want to be a father themselves but aren't sure if they can have kids due to adoption and surrogacy issues in their country. \n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of being jealous or having internalized homophobia. The author is struggling with their decision because they don't want to be just an uncle but want to be a full dad. They feel like they might never have kids otherwise. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to build a family and is reaching out to a close family member. On the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons related to their own desire for parenthood and the emotional impact of not being involved. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is about respecting personal boundaries and the autonomy of each individual. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even if it's a family member. Their reasons are personal and relate to their own future goals. However, the sister might feel betrayed or unsupported, especially since they were close. \n\nThe author did explain their feelings, but the sister didn't take it well. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make this decision for themselves. But some might argue that family responsibilities come into play here, especially since the sister was relying on them. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is being honest about their desires and limitations. They aren't denying the sister the chance to have kids entirely; they're just not willing to sacrifice their own potential parenthood. It's a tough spot, but personal choice is important. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their own life goals. It's not their responsibility to fulfill their sister's family wishes at the expense of their own.\n"
