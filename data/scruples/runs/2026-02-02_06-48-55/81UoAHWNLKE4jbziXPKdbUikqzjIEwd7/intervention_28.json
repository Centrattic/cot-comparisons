Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. The sister is a lesbian, and the author is gay. They're very close. The sister wants to have a family and asked the author to donate sperm so that her partner can get pregnant. The author refused because they want to be a dad themselves and don't want to just be an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable. The author is conflicted, feeling like maybe they should put their feelings aside but also not wanting to give up their dream of fatherhood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and personal aspects here. The sister is asking for a significant personal sacrifice from her brother. Donating sperm is a big deal, as it's about genetic contribution to a child. The author's reasons are personal: they want to be a parent and don't want their child raised by someone else. \n\nOn one hand, the sister's desire to have a child with her partner is valid. They might face challenges in having a family, especially if surrogacy isn't an option. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their own future over helping their sister. But on the other hand, the author has their own dreams of parenthood, which are equally valid. The author is not being asked to sacrifice their future entirely but is being asked to forgo a part of it (genetic contribution) to help their sister. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The sister's request is a form of a favor, but it's a major one. The author isn't refusing out of malice but because of personal goals. The sister might feel hurt because she expected support, but the author has a valid reason to decline. \n\nThe author might feel guilty because the sister is upset, but it's important to recognize that they have the right to their own aspirations. The sister's accusation of selfishness might not be fair because the author isn't denying the sister's needs but is choosing to prioritize their own. \n\nAlso, the legal and emotional complexities of surrogacy and adoption are mentioned, which add layers to the situation. The author isn't obligated to help, even if they are close. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's sister is disappointed, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to make their own choices about their future. The key point is that the author isn't being harmful but is making a personal decision based on their own desires.\n"
