Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's sister and her wife want to have a child and are asking him to donate sperm. He said no, and now they're upset with him. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is close to his sister, and he wants to have kids himself. He feels that donating sperm would mean his child would be raised by someone else, which he's not comfortable with. He's worried about missing out on fatherhood. His sister is upset and thinks he's selfish.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is in a position where she and her wife want to have a child and are looking for a sperm donor. Since the author is their brother, it's understandable that they might prefer using his sperm for genetic reasons. But the author has his own desires and feelings about becoming a father. He's not obligated to donate, even though they're family. \n\nThe key here is autonomy. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body. The author isn't being forced to do something he's uncomfortable with. His reasons are personal and valid. He's not trying to stop his sister from having kids; he just can't do that himself. \n\nHis sister is upset, which is sad, but the author's feelings are also important. He's not being selfish if he's making a choice that aligns with his own life goals. It's possible that the sister's expectations were not realistic, thinking that as a sibling, he would automatically agree. \n\nAnother point is that the author is considering the long-term impact on his own life. If he donates now, he might miss out on the chance to be a father in the way he wants. Even if he could have children later, the emotional aspect of being a dad is a big deal for him. \n\nThe sister might be feeling rejected, but that's part of the situation. The author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest about his feelings. He's not obligated to sacrifice his own dreams for theirs, even if they're family. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's refusal is based on personal reasons and his own future. It's not about being unkind or selfish, but about personal boundaries and life choices. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong."
