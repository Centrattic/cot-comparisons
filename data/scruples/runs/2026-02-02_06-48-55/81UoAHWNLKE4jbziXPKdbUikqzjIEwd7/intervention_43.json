Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is gay, so they're not interested in having a traditional family, but they want to be a father. Their sister is a lesbian, and she wants to have a child with her wife. She asked her brother to donate sperm so that both of them can be biologically related to the child. The author refuses because they want to be a father themselves and feel that donating would mean they can't be the primary parent. Their sister is upset, calling them selfish and accusing them of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the sister has a valid desire to have a child, and she's asking a family member who's willing to help. The author is close to her and has always supported her. Refusing might seem selfish because they have the ability to help and are choosing not to. However, the author's reasoning is about their own personal goals and desires. They want to be a father themselves, and they feel that donating sperm for someone else's family would conflict with that dream. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspect. Is it wrong to prioritize one's own dreams over a family member's needs? The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're just declining a request. The sister's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill her request. It's their body and their choice. The author's motivations are personal and valid. They might feel conflicted, but their decision isn't inherently wrong. \n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of selfishness might be a bit harsh. The author is not denying her the right to have children but is choosing to focus on their own future. It's a personal choice, not an act of denial. The author is not being unkind; they're just explaining their reasons. The sister's reaction could stem from hurt feelings rather than the author's actual wrongdoing.\n\nSo, in this case, the author's decision to say no isn't wrong. They have the right to make choices about their own reproductive future, even if it means their sister has to explore other options. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
