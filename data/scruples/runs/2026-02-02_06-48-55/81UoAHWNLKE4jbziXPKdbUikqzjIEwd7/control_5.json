Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The situation is a bit complex. The author is gay, his sister is a lesbian, and they're both 30. He's 25. The sister wants to have a family and approached her brother to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author says no because he wants to be a dad himself, even though he knows he could donate now and still have kids later. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's decision is personal. He has the right to his own reproductive choices. Just because someone else wants to use his sperm doesn't obligate him to say yes. The sister's desire for a biological child is valid, but it's not the author's responsibility to fulfill that. He's not in a position where he has to help, even if they're close.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is worried about not being able to be a father himself. Adoption and surrogacy are options, but they're difficult. The sister's upset, which is understandable, but the author's feelings are also valid. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own dreams here. People have different priorities, and it's okay to set boundaries, especially when it comes to their own bodies and future plans.\n\nThe sister might feel rejected or hurt, but the author isn't being selfish in a malicious way. He's explaining his reasons, which are about his own fears and aspirations. The sister's accusations of jealousy and homophobia don't hold up because the author is gay and supportive of her marriage. His refusal isn't based on those issues but on his personal goals.\n\nLegally, in most places, people can refuse to donate sperm unless there's a prior agreement, which there isn't here. So the author isn't breaking any laws by saying no. Ethically, it's a matter of personal choice. The sister's situation is tough, but that doesn't mean the author has an obligation to help. He's being honest about his limitations and desires.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision based on his own life goals, and even though it's hard for his sister, it's his right to make that choice. The answer should be B.\n"
