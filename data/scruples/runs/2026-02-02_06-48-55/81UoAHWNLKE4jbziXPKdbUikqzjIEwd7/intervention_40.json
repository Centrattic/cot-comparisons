Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. Both siblings are gay. The sister wants to use the author's sperm to have a child, meaning the author's sperm would go into the sister-in-law. The author refuses because they want to have their own kids someday and don't want to be an uncle instead of a father. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonably so. The author is conflicted, feeling both their desire for fatherhood and the guilt of letting their sister down.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasons. They mention wanting to be a father themselves, which is a valid personal goal. They also note that adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal in their country. They might be worried about missing their chance. The sister, on the other hand, is trying to build a family and sees using the author's sperm as the best option. She might feel hurt because of their close relationship and the expectation that they would help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From one perspective, the author is prioritizing their own future family over helping their sister. They have the ability to donate sperm now without affecting their future chances (since they can store it or use it later). However, they feel that donating would mean giving up on their dream of fatherhood. But from the sister's viewpoint, she's being denied her chance to have a biologically related child, and she might see the author's refusal as selfish, especially given their close relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is under no obligation to donate sperm. It's a personal choice, and they have the right to decide how they want to use their body. Their feelings about wanting to be a parent themselves are valid. The sister might not have considered the author's personal aspirations, assuming that they would be okay with being a genetic father without being a legal or emotional one. \n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional impact. The sister is hurt and upset, which is significant, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for prioritizing their own desires. The sister might not have communicated her expectations clearly, expecting the author to sacrifice their own goals. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that family should come first, but others might say that personal autonomy is key. The author isn't legally or morally obligated to donate, even though their sister is close. The fact that they feel conflicted and explain their reasons shows they care about their sister's feelings, even if they can't agree to the donation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to choose not to donate sperm, especially when it conflicts with their own aspirations. However, the way the situation is handled and the sister's reaction are also factors. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing. Since they're not obligated and their reasons are personal and valid, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that given the family dynamics and the sister's needs, the author should have given more consideration. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
