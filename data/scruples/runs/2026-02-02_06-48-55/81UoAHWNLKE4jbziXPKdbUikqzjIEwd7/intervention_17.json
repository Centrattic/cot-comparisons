Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her partner. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is gay and close to his sister. She wants to start a family and asked him to donate sperm. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself. He feels that donating would mean his child is raised by someone else, making him an uncle instead of a dad. He explained his reasons, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal desire to be a parent versus his sister's need for biological connection. The sister sees this as a way to have a child with both her and her partner's genes, which is understandable. The author's reasons are valid\u2014his own dreams of fatherhood. But from the sister's perspective, this is a significant request, especially since she's relying on him for this.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not being selfish just because he has his own goals. People have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and future. However, the sister's feelings are also valid; she's disappointed and hurt. The author did explain his reasons, which he should have done, but maybe he could have approached it differently.\n\nThe author isn't legally or morally obligated to donate sperm. It's a personal choice. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing his own desires over her needs, but that's not necessarily wrong. It's a conflict between two valid desires. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on the perspective. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the key here is whether the author's refusal is considered selfish despite his explanations.\n\nIn many cases, people might see the author's decision as justified because it's his body and his future. But others might argue that family should come first. The sister's accusations of homophobia might not be fair, as the author's reasoning is about his own family plans, not prejudice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his own life goals, and it's not his responsibility to fulfill his sister's wish if it conflicts with his own aspirations.\n"
