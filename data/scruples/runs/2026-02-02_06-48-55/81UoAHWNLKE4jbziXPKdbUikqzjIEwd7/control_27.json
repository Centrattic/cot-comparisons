Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a gay man, 25, and his sister, who's a lesbian, is 30 and wants to use his sperm to have a child with her wife. The author refuses because he wants to be a dad himself and doesn't want his kids to be raised by others. The sister is upset, calling him selfish, and he's questioning if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is being asked to donate sperm, which is a big deal. The sister wants biological ties for her and her partner. The author's reasons are personal: he wants to be a father and feels that donating would prevent that. But he also mentions that he could still have kids later, so maybe that's not entirely accurate? Wait, he says he knows he can donate now and still have his own kids later. So his refusal isn't based on biological impossibility but personal desire to be involved as a parent.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The sister is hurt and upset. The author is close to her, and she's accusing him of selfishness and jealousy. The question is whether his refusal is justified.\n\nFrom one angle, people have the right to their own reproductive choices. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even to a family member. His reasons are valid because he's prioritizing his own dreams. On the other hand, his sister is in a position where she might have a harder time becoming a parent because of legal barriers (surrogacy isn't legal, adoption is hard). She's using a method (IVF) that's available, but needs his help. \n\nBut is it fair to expect a sibling to give up their potential to be a parent? Maybe not. The author's decision is about his future, which is personal. However, the sister might feel rejected or that her needs are being dismissed. \n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of internalized homophobia and jealousy might be unfair. The author isn't opposing her having kids; he's just not willing to be the sperm donor. It's possible she's conflating his refusal with something else because of their shared identity as LGBTQ+.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a personal choice based on his own desires. However, there's a balance between personal rights and family dynamics. But since he's not causing her direct harm beyond the emotional aspect, and he's not obligated, maybe he's not wrong. His reasons are about his own future as a parent, which is a valid consideration. The sister's disappointment is real, but the author isn't morally obligated here. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's an argument that he could be more supportive. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong. Since it's his body and his choice, even though it's hurting his sister, it's not necessarily wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
