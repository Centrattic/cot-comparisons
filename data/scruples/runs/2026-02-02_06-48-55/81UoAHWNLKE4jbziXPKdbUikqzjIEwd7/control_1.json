Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a 25-year-old gay man. His sister, a lesbian, is 30 and married. She wants to have a family and is asking him to donate sperm so that her baby can have both her and her partner's genes (the sperm would go into her wife, not her). He feels uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He explains his reasoning, but his sister is upset and calls him selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Donating sperm is a big commitment. It's not just about the physical donation but also the emotional and psychological implications. The author is clear that he wants to be a father and doesn't want to become a donor, even if he could use his own sperm for his own future family. His reasoning is personal and valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a situation where she can't have a biological child without a donor. Using a known donor (her brother) allows both partners to be biologically related. But she might feel that her brother is rejecting her when she's trying to build a family. The sister's feelings of being denied a family or being called selfish are hurtful.\n\nI need to balance both perspectives. Is the author in the wrong for not wanting to donate? Well, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm. His desire to have children himself is a legitimate personal goal. The sister might feel betrayed, but the author is not morally or ethically required to fulfill her request if he doesn't want to. \n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of internalized homophobia and jealousy might be unfair. The author's reasons are about his own aspirations, not about homophobia. It's possible that the sister is struggling with the rejection and projecting her hurt onto him. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister should respect her brother's choice, even if she's disappointed. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing his own future family plans over her request. He's being honest about his feelings, which is important for maintaining trust in their relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a personal choice based on his own desires and circumstances, which is valid.\n"
