Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and married to another woman. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm so that the baby would have both her and her wife's genes. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to just be an uncle. They turned down the request, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish and unreasonable. The author is now questioning if they're being an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The sister is in a position where she wants to have a biological child with her wife. Using a sperm donor is a common choice for lesbian couples to have a genetically related child. The author is willing to help in other ways but not to donate sperm. Their reasoning is that they want to be a parent themselves, not just a donor. But the sister feels rejected and accuses them of selfishness. \n\nOn one hand, the author has their own personal desires and feelings about fatherhood. It's valid for them to want to be fully involved as a parent, not just a donor. They might fear that donating sperm would lead to emotional attachment or future complications if they ever meet the child. Also, the sister's couple can use a commercial sperm donor, so maybe the author isn't the only option. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a vulnerable position, hoping for support from her close sibling. The author's refusal might feel like a rejection of her family's dream. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own potential future over her immediate need for a child. \n\nThe author mentions they could donate now and still have kids later, but their emotional stance is strong. They argue it's not about the availability of sperm but about the desire to be a father. The sister is upset, which is a key point. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, is it ethical to refuse? Everyone has the right to make personal decisions about their body, even if others find them selfish. However, the sister's feelings are real and hurt by the refusal. The author isn't obligated to donate, but the way they handled it might have been harsh. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author's reasons are personal and valid, but the sister's perspective is also important. The answer might depend on whether the author is being selfish or standing by their own values and future. Since the author is not the only possible donor, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the sister's couple can't use a commercial donor for some reason, the author might be a key option. \n\nThe sister is calling the author names and being upset, but the author's refusal is based on genuine feelings. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because it's their body and their decision, even if others are upset. But maybe A if the author could be considered selfish despite understanding reasons. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nI think the key here is the author's right to their own reproductive choices. While the sister's feelings are hurt, the author isn't obligated to donate. The sister could have handled it differently by considering other donors. The author's feelings about fatherhood are their own, even if they seem conflicting with their sexuality. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
