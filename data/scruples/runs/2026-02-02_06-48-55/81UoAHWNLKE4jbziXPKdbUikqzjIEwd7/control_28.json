Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister's lesbian partner. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm. The author is gay, so they might have a different perspective on fatherhood. The sister thinks using the author's sperm would let both her and her partner be biologically related to the child. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a parent themselves, not just an uncle. They're worried that donating sperm would mean the child is raised by someone else, which they don't want. They mentioned that adoption is hard and surrogacy isn't legal in their country, so they might not have other options later.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of being jealous or having internalized homophobia. The author is conflicted, feeling like they might be right to refuse but also guilty for making their sister upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the sister has a legitimate desire to have a family and uses the author's sperm to be genetically related. On the other, the author has personal reasons to refuse, including their own desire to be a parent. It's their body and their sperm, so they have autonomy over that. However, the sister might feel betrayed because they're close, and the author is prioritizing their own desires over helping their sibling.\n\nBut the author isn't obligated to donate. Even if the sister is upset, the decision to donate sperm is personal. The author isn't being unkind; they're explaining their feelings. The sister's accusations might be hurtful, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to. The key points are autonomy and personal choice versus familial expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that's important to them, even if it upsets their sister.\n"
