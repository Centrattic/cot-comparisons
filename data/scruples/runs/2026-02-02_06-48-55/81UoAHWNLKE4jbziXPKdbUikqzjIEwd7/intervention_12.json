Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and married to another woman. The sister is a lesbian, and so is the author. The sister wants to have a family and asked the author to donate sperm. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves, not just an uncle. They mentioned that surrogacy isn't legal in their country, but IVF is for lesbian couples. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the ethical, emotional, and personal aspects here. On one hand, the sister is seeking help to start a family, which is a significant life goal. On the other hand, the author has their own aspirations and feelings about fatherhood. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. **Family Relationship**: The author and sister are very close, so the author might feel a duty to help. But personal boundaries and desires are also important.\n2. **Author's Feelings**: The author is not comfortable with donating sperm because they want to be a parent themselves. They might fear being treated as just an uncle, not a father. It's about personal fulfillment and identity.\n3. **Sister's Perspective**: She's disappointed and feels rejected. The author's refusal might make her feel like her needs are being ignored, especially since she's already going through the process of using IVF, which is legal, but maybe the author's donation would make it easier or more affordable.\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong to prioritize one's own desires over a family member's request? Or is it reasonable to have personal boundaries regarding such a significant decision?\n5. **Lack of Obligation**: Sperm donation is a personal choice. The author isn't under any legal or moral obligation to donate, even for family. However, the sister might feel that the author's closeness implies a duty.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on their own desire to be a parent, which is valid. But the sister might see this as a way to include both her and her partner's genes, and she's asking for help. The sister's reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the context. \n\nI think the answer hinges on consent and personal choice. The author isn't obligated to donate, so refusing isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the refusal was handled and the sister's feelings are important. The author could be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their reasons clearly or if there was pressure involved. But in this case, the author did explain their feelings, even though the sister was upset. \n\nThe sister's use of terms like \"selfish\" and \"unreasonable\" might be a reaction to her own disappointment. The author's desire to be a father is a personal matter, and they have the right to prioritize their own future family plans. It's a tough situation, but it's more about differing personal values than right and wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for saying no, even if it's difficult for the sister. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that family support is important, and the author's refusal could be seen as not supporting their sister's needs. However, the author is not in a position where they have a duty to provide their sperm. The sister's request is valid, but the author's right to refuse is also valid. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a personal choice based on their own aspirations and boundaries, which is acceptable. The sister's upset is unfortunate, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong.\n"
