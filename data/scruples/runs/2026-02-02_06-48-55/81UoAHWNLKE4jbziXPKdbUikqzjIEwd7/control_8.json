Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and her wife is also 30. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a parent themselves in the future. The sister is upset and calls the author selfish, but the author feels that donating would take away their chance to be a father, which is a big dream for them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's desire to have a child with her wife, the author's personal aspiration to be a parent, and the emotional conflict between them. The author is refusing not out of malice but because of their own dreams and fears of missing out on fatherhood. The sister is hurt and feels the author is being selfish, but the author is explaining their reasoning.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal choices about their bodies and reproductive options. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even for family. While the sister's desire to have a child is valid, the author's feelings about their own future are also valid. The sister might not understand the author's perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's a personal decision. However, the author might feel guilty for causing their sister distress. \n\nBut is the author being unreasonable? They are not in a position where they've already had children. They have their own plans and fears. The sister's request is understandable, but the author has the autonomy to say no. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a personal choice based on their own aspirations, even though it's causing family tension. The sister's hurt feelings don't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or ethical obligation here. In some cultures, family obligations might be stronger, but in general, reproductive rights are personal. The author's refusal isn't malicious; it's based on their own desires and fears. The sister might need to find another way, like using a sperm donor. The author isn't being selfish if they're not making a gain from this, just protecting their own future options. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
