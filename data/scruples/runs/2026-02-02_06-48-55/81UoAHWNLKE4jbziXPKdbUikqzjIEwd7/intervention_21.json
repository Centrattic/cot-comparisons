Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is gay, 25, and his sister is a lesbian, married to another woman. The sister wants to have a family and is asking him to donate sperm so that both her and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is close to his sister and has always supported her. However, he feels conflicted because he also wants to be a father himself in the future. He's worried about not being able to experience fatherhood if he donates now, even though he could still have kids later. He's facing criticism from his sister, who's upset and calling him selfish. The author is torn between his own desires and his sister's needs.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's reasons for refusal and whether they are valid. On one hand, the author is prioritizing his own future family plans. He mentions that he wants to be a dad and wants to be fully involved in the child's life. That's a personal aspiration, which is understandable. On the other hand, his sister is in a position where she might have a harder time becoming a parent, especially given the legal constraints in their country regarding surrogacy. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, including donating sperm. However, the sister's perspective is that this is her chance to have a child with her partner, and she's feeling let down by her brother. The author isn't being asked to give up his future entirely; he's just being asked to donate sperm, which is a one-time act. But he's concerned about not being able to have his own children later, even though he can use IVF or other methods. \n\nThe sister's frustration is about feeling like her needs are being ignored, especially since she's close to the author. The author's reasons for refusing are personal and based on his desire to be a father. But is that a valid reason? It's not like donating sperm would prevent him from having future children. The sister might argue that she's in a more time-sensitive situation, given her age and the challenges same-sex couples face in having biological children. \n\nHowever, the author is not obligated to donate. It's his body, and his feelings about fatherhood are valid. But the sister feels hurt and ungrateful. The dilemma is between personal choice and familial duty. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because he can't be forced to donate. Ethically, it's more complex. If he's not being asked to sacrifice anything significant beyond his sperm, and he has valid personal reasons, then he's not necessarily being selfish. However, the sister's perspective is that he's not supporting her in her time of need, which could make him seem selfish from her viewpoint. \n\nBut considering that the author is also making a personal sacrifice by not fulfilling his sister's request to support his own dreams, it's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. However, the author isn't being unreasonable for prioritizing his own future. So, while his sister is upset, he's not in the wrong for saying no.\n"
