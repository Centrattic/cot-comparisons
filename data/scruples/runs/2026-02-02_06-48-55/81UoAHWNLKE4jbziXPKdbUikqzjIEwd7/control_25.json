Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and married to another woman. The sister wants to have a child and is asking the author to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related. The author is gay and close to their sister, but they feel uncomfortable because they want to be a parent themselves in the future. They explained their reasons but the sister is upset, calling them selfish and unreasonable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. On one hand, the sister is seeking help to build her family, which is a significant life decision. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting their sibling in a crucial time. On the other hand, the author has personal reasons related to their desire to be a parent and the emotional impact of not being involved in the child's life. \n\nIt's important to recognize that while family support is valuable, individuals also have the right to make personal choices about their bodies and future. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, especially since they have their own aspirations. The sister's accusation of selfishness is subjective; the author's feelings are valid. \n\nThe situation might be a matter of differing priorities. The sister sees the request as a favor that aligns with their family's goals, while the author's priorities involve their personal dreams. Neither is inherently wrong, but the author might be seen as not considering their sister's perspective fully. However, the author's right to their own choices should be respected.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that family should come first, but in others, personal autonomy is key. The answer likely hinges on whether the refusal is seen as a reasonable personal choice or as selfish. Given that the author is not causing direct harm and has valid personal reasons, the more balanced view is that they are not in the wrong. However, this is nuanced. The sister's feelings are hurt, but the author's decision isn't necessarily unethical. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
