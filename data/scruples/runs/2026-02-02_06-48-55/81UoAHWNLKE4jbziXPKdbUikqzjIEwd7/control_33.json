Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would allow both her and her partner to be biologically related. She's asking for help, and the author feels very close to her. On the other hand, the author has his own reasons for declining: he wants to be a father himself, feels that donating would prevent that, and is concerned about not being able to experience fatherhood.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and personal choice. The author is making a decision based on his own desires and future plans. It's his body, and he has the right to decide what he's comfortable with. Even though his sister is upset, his feelings about wanting to be a parent are valid. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister might feel rejected or hurt, especially since they are very close. The author acknowledges that he's causing her pain, which is understandable. But does that make him wrong? Not necessarily. People have the right to prioritize their own needs, especially when it comes to their future.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's perspective. She might see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a child with her partner, and the author's refusal could feel like a betrayal. But she also needs to respect his autonomy. The situation is complex because both parties have valid emotions and needs.\n\nLooking at the author's reasoning: he wants to be a father, adoption is difficult, surrogacy isn't an option. His reasons are personal and not based on prejudice, as he clarifies. He's not opposing his sister having kids but wants to fulfill his own dream. The sister's reactions of calling him selfish might stem from her own hurt and frustration, not necessarily from the author being wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, personal autonomy is a strong factor. It's not wrong for someone to prioritize their own goals, even if it disappoints others. The author isn't causing harm by saying no; the harm comes from the emotional impact on his sister. However, that doesn't necessarily make him at fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a personal choice based on his own aspirations and feelings. The sister's disappointment is valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own future for hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
