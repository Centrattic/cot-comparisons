Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. I need to analyze the details and come up with a justified answer.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister is a 30-year-old lesbian who's married. They're close. The sister wants to start a family and is asking the author to donate sperm. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself, with full involvement in the child's life, not just as an uncle. He's worried that donating would take away his chance to be a parent. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider different angles. From a rights perspective, the author has the right to make decisions about his body. Sperm donation is a personal choice, and he's not obligated to do it. However, the sister sees it as a favor to help her and her partner have a child. There's also the emotional aspect of their relationship and how the refusal has affected her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to be a father himself. He's not opposing them having kids, just not using his sperm. The sister might feel rejected, especially since they're close. But the author's reasons are valid; he's prioritizing his own future family plans. It's not about jealousy, as he acknowledges the sister's desire for a family.\n\nThere's also the fact that in his country, surrogacy isn't legal, so IVF for lesbian couples is an option, which suggests that the sister's path to parenthood is possible through other means. But she's choosing to use a relative's sperm, which the author isn't comfortable with.\n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia might be unfounded. The author isn't against her having a family; he's against a specific method that conflicts with his own goals. Being a sperm donor doesn't necessarily equate to being a father, so his concern about not being involved makes sense. \n\nLegally and ethically, people can choose not to donate, even if they have the means. The key here is consent and personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary that aligns with his personal values and future plans. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to meet her expectations at the expense of his own desires.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). His decision is based on his own life plans and the right to choose what he's comfortable with, even if it causes tension.\n"
