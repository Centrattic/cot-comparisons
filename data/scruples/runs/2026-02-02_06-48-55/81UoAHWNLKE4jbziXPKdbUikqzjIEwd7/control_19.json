Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, as is his sister, and they're both close.\n\nFirst, the sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be an uncle. He's worried about not having the chance to be a parent, especially since adoption and surrogacy are tough in his country. \n\nThe sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia. The author is questioning if his reasons are valid or if he's being unreasonable. \n\nSo, legally, in many places, sperm donation is a medical procedure where the donor's rights are often relinquished, making him the biological father but not the legal parent. If the author donates, he might lose any chance to have his own children later, depending on medical factors. But he's 25, so he has time for IVF or other options. \n\nEthically, the sister is seeking help from her sibling, which is a personal and significant request. The author has the right to his own reproductive choices. However, the sister might feel the request is more about her family-building needs. \n\nThe author's reasons are personal and valid. Wanting to be a parent is a strong desire. The sister's frustration comes from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own dreams. \n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of jealousy or homophobia might not hold if the author is genuinely conflicted about his role as a parent versus an uncle. \n\nSo, the answer isn't a clear yes or no. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own future. However, the sister's feelings are valid too. The key is that both have valid perspectives, but the author isn't at fault for declining.\n"
