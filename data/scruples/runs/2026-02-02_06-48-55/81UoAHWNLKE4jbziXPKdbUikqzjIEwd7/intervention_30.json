Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is 25, and the sister is 30. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author feels conflicted because they want to be a parent themselves and are worried about not being involved in the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The sister is seeking biological ties for her family, which is a valid desire. The author's refusal is based on their own future plans and emotional boundaries. But is that a reasonable stance? The author emphasizes their desire to be a full-time parent, which is understandable. However, the sister is also in a situation where she's trying to build a family, which is a significant life goal.\n\nThe sister might feel betrayed because they were close and expected support. The author's explanation about not wanting to be an uncle instead of a parent makes sense, but it's also about prioritizing their own dreams. The key here is whether the author's \"no\" is selfish. The sister might perceive it that way, but the author's reasons are personal and valid.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and medical aspects. Sperm donation between family members can have legal implications, especially if the donor isn't intended to be a parent. The author might be right in wanting to avoid that scenario. However, the sister's need for genetic material from a family member could be seen as a genuine request, and the author's refusal might hinder her ability to have a child with her partner.\n\nThe author's argument that they can still have kids later is logical, but fertility can be an uncertain path. The sister's emotional upset adds another layer. The author might be right in setting boundaries for themselves, even if it causes tension. Ultimately, whether it's \"the wrong\" depends on whose needs are prioritized. The author's reasons are self-centered in a way, but they are also making a personal choice about their future. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid feelings. The sister's hurt is real, but the author's decision is based on their own aspirations. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because they are asserting their own needs, even if it causes conflict.\n"
