Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, so they don't plan on having kids through a traditional route. Their sister wants a biological child and is asking the author to be a sperm donor. The author is worried about not being able to have their own children later and not being involved in the child's life. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the family. The sister and her wife are trying to start a family, which is a significant life goal for many. The author is close to their sister and has always supported her. By refusing, the author is denying her a potential way to have a child with her partner. \n\nThe author's main argument is their own desire to have children one day. But technically, sperm donation is a way to preserve sperm for the future. The author could freeze samples now and still use them later. So maybe the fear of not being able to have kids is a bit irrational in that sense. \n\nHowever, the author's emotional reasons are valid. They want to be fully involved in a child's life, not just a donor. That's a personal choice and not necessarily selfish. But when they say no, they're making a decision that affects their sister's plans. \n\nThe sister is upset, feeling rejected and accused of being selfish. The author might be in a tough spot because their sister sees this as a critical step for her family. The author's refusal could be seen as putting personal desires above their sister's needs, even if those desires are legitimate. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to make choices about their own body and reproductive material. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially since they have their own reasons. But in a close-knit family, the expectations can be high, and the sister might feel the author is being inconsiderate. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The author's reasons are understandable, but the impact on their sister is significant. The key here is whether the author's refusal is considered self-centered compared to their sister's needs. Some might argue the author is in the right because it's their body, while others might think they should support their sister's family-building efforts. \n\nConsidering the sister's perspective, she's seeking help from her sibling in a vulnerable time. The author's decision to say no could be seen as denying her a chance to have a biological child, which is a big deal. However, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to do this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own future family plans over their sister's current needs. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect family members to support each other in such matters, but personal boundaries are also important. The author might not be in the wrong, but the sister's hurt feelings indicate that the author's refusal is causing emotional harm. \n\nThe final decision hinges on balancing personal rights against family expectations. The author has the right to refuse, but the sister's disappointment is valid. So, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, the way they handled it might have been insensitive. But according to the question's options, it's a yes or no. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make their own reproductive choices. However, there's a middle ground where they could offer alternatives or support in other ways. But given the scenario, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) since the author isn't obligated to donate.\n"
