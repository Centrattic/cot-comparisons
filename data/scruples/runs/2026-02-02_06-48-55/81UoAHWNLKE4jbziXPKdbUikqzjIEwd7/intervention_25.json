Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me start by understanding the situation better.\n\nThe author is 25, his sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. They're all close, and the sister wants to start a family. She asked the author to donate sperm so that the baby would have both her and her partner's genes. The author is gay and also wants to have kids one day, but he's uncomfortable with the idea of his sperm being used in his sister-in-law, making him just an uncle. He explained his reasons, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author has the right to his own reproductive choices. Donating sperm is a personal decision, and even though the sister is a close family member, he's not obligated to do it. However, the sister is in a situation where she wants to have a biological child and might be relying on him. The author's concern about wanting to be a father himself is valid. But does that make him selfish? Maybe not, because it's about his own future.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a rights perspective, no one can force someone else to donate sperm. However, in terms of family dynamics, there might be expectations. The sister might feel hurt because she's asking for help from a sibling who she felt would support her. The author's reasons seem personal and valid, but the sister's reaction is understandable too.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the sister's partner isn't his sister, so he's not directly being a father to his sister. But he's concerned about being just an uncle. That's his personal desire, which is important. However, the sister's need for a child is another important aspect. But since he's not biologically related to the sister (as she's a lesbian), the connection is through her partner. \n\nThe author also says he's not against his sister having kids but just doesn't want to donate. That's a key point. He's not trying to stop her, just choosing not to participate. The sister might feel betrayed, but does the author owe her this? Since it's a personal choice, maybe not. \n\nHowever, sometimes family situations can create expectations. If the sister believed the author would support her and now he's refusing, that could be seen as a violation of trust. But again, the author has his own aspirations and reasons. \n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia might be unfair. The author's reasons are about his own desires, not homophobia. But maybe the sister is hurt and taking it out on him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has the autonomy to make this decision. But in terms of family relationships, it's a sensitive issue. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his own future and feelings. However, he might need to work on maintaining the relationship. The sister's feelings are valid too, but the author isn't obligated to donate. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
