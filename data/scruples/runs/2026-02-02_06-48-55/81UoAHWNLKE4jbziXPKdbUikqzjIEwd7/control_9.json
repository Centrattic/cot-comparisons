Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is gay, and his sister is a lesbian. They're very close. The sister wants to have a family and is asking her brother to donate sperm. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself one day, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He's worried about not having the chance to be a dad in the future. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable. The author is torn between his feelings and his sister's needs.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Well, donating sperm is a personal decision. There's no legal obligation for him to do so, even though they're family. He has his own reproductive goals. On the other hand, his sister is in a position where she wants to have a biological child with her partner, and she's reaching out to her brother for help. Refusing can be seen as not supporting her, but supporting her might mean sacrificing his own future.\n\nBut here's the thing: his reasons are about his own desires and fears. He's not being asked to give up his sperm forever; it's a one-time donation. But he's worried about not being able to have kids later. However, he's young (25) and has time to pursue options like IVF or adoption, even though he mentions they're difficult. Still, he's choosing not to donate because he wants to be a father himself. That's his right, but maybe he's not considering the impact on his sister.\n\nThe sister is in a situation where she might need a sperm donor, and using her brother's sperm would allow both her and her partner to be biologically related. The author's refusal is causing her distress. But is he selfish? He's not obligated to do this. However, the closeness of the relationship might imply that he's expected to help. But the author clearly states that he wants to be a father, which is a valid personal goal.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's making a personal choice based on his own desires, which is okay. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't legally or ethically obligated to donate. His reasons, while self-serving, are genuine. The sister's hurt feelings are real, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong because he's prioritizing his own future. However, there's a moral argument that family should support each other in such matters. But again, there's no obligation unless it's agreed upon beforehand.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the refusal is seen as a breach of familial duty. Since he's not forced to donate, and his reasons are personal and valid, he's not in the wrong. But there's a gray area because of the sister's needs. However, the question is whether he's wrong, and since he's making a personal choice, the answer is B (No).\n"
