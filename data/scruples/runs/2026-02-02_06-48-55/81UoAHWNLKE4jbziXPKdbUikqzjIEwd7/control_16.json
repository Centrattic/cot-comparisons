Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is gay, 25, and his sister is a lesbian who wants to have a family. She's asking him to donate sperm so that her child can have both her and her wife's genes. The author refuses because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be just the uncle. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy and internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Well, the author's reasons are about his own desires for parenthood. He wants to be fully involved as a father, not just a donor. That seems valid because donating sperm in this context is a big decision. It's not just a one-time thing; it's about his future plans. The sister's needs are important, but so are the author's. \n\nIs there a duty to help a sister in this way? Maybe if there were no personal issues, but the author clearly has emotional and personal reasons. He's not denying her the chance to have kids entirely; he's just not willing to be the donor. There are other options like using a sperm bank, even though it's more complicated. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction might be hurtful, but her feelings are valid too. She might feel rejected, especially since they're close. However, the author isn't at fault for prioritizing his own future family plans. It's a personal choice, not a selfish one. \n\nSo, the key points are: personal autonomy in reproductive decisions, the validity of the author's desire to be a father, and the sister's other options. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own life goals. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
