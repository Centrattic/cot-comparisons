Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is a lesbian married to another woman and wants to have a child using the author's sperm. The author is gay, so there's no romantic or sexual relationship between them. The author is close to his sister and feels the request is conflicting with his own desire to become a father someday. He doesn't want to donate because he wants to be actively involved in a child's life, not just a sperm donor. He's worried about missing out on parenthood since adoption and surrogacy are difficult in his country.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia. The author is questioning if his reasons are valid or if he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and personal choice. The author has the right to make decisions about his own body. Even though the request comes from a family member, he's not obligated to comply. His reasons are based on his future hopes and the desire to be a parent, which are valid personal goals. \n\nHowever, the sister's perspective is also important. She's in a situation where she wants to have a child with her partner, and the author is a relative who could help. The tension arises from conflicting desires: the sister wants to build her family, and the author wants to have his own family in the future.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author isn't wrong for refusing. He's not causing harm; he's choosing his own path. The sister's accusations might stem from hurt feelings, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The question is whether his decision is wrong. Since he's not causing direct harm and is making a personal choice, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that family obligations or the sister's needs make him selfish, but personal autonomy is a strong counterpoint here. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, family support is expected, but in others, individual rights take precedence. The author's explanation is sincere, emphasizing his own dreams and concerns. The sister's hurt is real, but that doesn't automatically make the author wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
