Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is gay, and his sister is a lesbian. They're both close. The sister wants to have a family and is asking her brother to donate sperm for her and her partner. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a dad himself and doesn't want the child to be raised by someone else, even if it's his sister. He feels it's important to be 100% involved in a child's life. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and using terms like internalized homophobia. The author is struggling with whether his reasons are valid.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's personal feelings about fatherhood versus his sister's needs. The question is whether his refusal is justified or if he's being unreasonable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking a way to have a child with her partner, using her brother's sperm. She sees it as a solution that would allow both parents to be biologically related to the child. The author's refusal might hinder that. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about his own future as a parent. He wants to be directly involved in his child's life, not just a donor. His reasons are personal and relate to his own desires and limitations, like the difficulty of adoption or surrogacy in his country.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to prioritize his own potential future as a parent over his sister's current needs? Well, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and futures. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if it's for family. However, the sister might feel let down, especially since they're close. But the author isn't being selfish if his reasons are based on his own life goals. The sister's criticism about selfishness and internalized homophobia might be unfair, as the author is making a personal choice. \n\nMaybe the problem is that the author didn't communicate his feelings better or consider alternatives, like other sperm donors. But the situation presents a conflict between two personal desires: the sister's wish to have a child and the author's desire to be a father. Without a clear obligation, it's hard to say one is more right than the other. So, is the author in the wrong? If he's acting on his own wishes, then no. He isn't obligated to donate. But if he's being insensitive to his sister's situation, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his own values and future, even if it causes pain.\n"
