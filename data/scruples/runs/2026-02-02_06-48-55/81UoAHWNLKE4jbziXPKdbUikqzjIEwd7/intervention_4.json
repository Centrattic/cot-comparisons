Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The situation is that the sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author doesn't want to because they want to be a father themselves and feel they can't be just an uncle. They're worried about missing out on fatherhood, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points. The author has personal reasons for saying no, which is about their own desire to be a parent. The sister sees this as a way to have a child with both her and her partner's genes. The author is gay, which complicates their own path to parenthood. The sister is also gay, so they're navigating similar challenges but with different options available. The author is concerned about surrogacy not being legal and adoption being difficult. \n\nSo, is refusing a valid choice? Well, donating sperm is a big commitment. It's not just about the physical act but also the emotional and ethical implications. The author is clear that they want to be fully involved in their own children's lives, which is a legitimate desire. They're not denying their sister the possibility of having a child; they're just prioritizing their own future family plans. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a situation where using the author's sperm allows her and her partner to both be biologically related to the child. She might feel that the author is not considering her needs. But the author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own body and future. The sister's reaction might stem from feeling hurt and rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for saying no. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish if they're being honest about their own needs. It's a matter of personal choice and prioritizing their own goals. The sister could seek another sperm donor if necessary. The fact that the author is gay and the sister is lesbian adds another layer, but their individual desires to parent should be respected. \n\nI think the key here is autonomy over one's body and future. The author has the right to decline without feeling guilty, as long as they're not causing harm beyond their own decision. The sister's upset is valid, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill her request if it conflicts with their own life plans. So, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
