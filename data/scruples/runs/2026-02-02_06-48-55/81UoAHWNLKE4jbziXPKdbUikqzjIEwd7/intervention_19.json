Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about donating sperm to his sister and her wife. The author is gay, 25, and the sister is 30. The sister asked him to donate sperm so the baby would have both their genes. He refused because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle. He's worried about not having kids later and the emotional aspect. His sister is upset, calling him selfish.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I need to consider is the author's reasons. He's not being cruel; he has valid concerns about his own future as a potential parent. He mentions adoption and surrogacy being difficult, so he's not in a good position to have kids, which adds to his anxiety. On the other hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to have a child with her partner and is seeking help from her brother, who is biologically related. \n\nBut is it wrong to say no? Well, the sister is asking for help, but it's not a legal obligation. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm. The sister's disappointment is understandable, but the author's feelings are also valid. He's prioritizing his own desires here. The sister might feel hurt because they are close, but respecting his own boundaries is important too. \n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia are a bit harsh. The author's reasoning isn't about homophobia; he's a gay man who's dealing with his own fears about fatherhood. It's a personal choice, and while it's tough to say no to a sibling, he's not wrong for valuing his own future as a parent. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. From his sister's viewpoint, she's being denied help, but from his, he's protecting his own goals. Since the decision isn't affecting anyone's rights except his own and the sister's, I think he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
