Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. The sister is a lesbian, and the author is gay. They're very close. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm so that her and her wife can have a child. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a dad themselves, not just an uncle. They explained their feelings, but the sister is upset, calling them selfish and unreasonable. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue is the ethics of the author's refusal. Is it selfish to say no to a close family member's request for something that could help them have a child, especially when the author can still have their own children later? \n\nOn one hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to have a biological child with her partner. The author is a genetic relative, so using their sperm would allow both partners to have a biological connection (the sister would carry the child, and the partner would be the other parent). The author is being asked to make a small sacrifice (donating sperm) which doesn't affect their ability to have children later, as they mentioned. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own desires over helping her, especially since they are close. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a strong emotional reason for declining. They want to experience parenthood fully, not just as an uncle. The author's feelings about their own future as a parent are valid. It's possible that the author is not being selfish but rather making a personal choice based on their own dreams. The sister's frustration comes from feeling rejected, especially after being close and supportive in the past. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the sister's perspective. The sister might need this deeply and the author's refusal could be seen as a rejection of her family-building plans. The author argues they have an \"infinite supply of sperm,\" but the sister only needs a sample. The author isn't being forced to have a child, just to donate sperm, which is a temporary commitment. If the author is able to do this without compromising their own future, maybe they should consider it. \n\nBut there's also a right to personal autonomy. The author can't be forced to make a life decision that affects their own future. The sister's hurt feelings are real, but the author's decision is about their own values and aspirations. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author is able to help without sacrificing their own goals, maybe they should try. But if their refusal is based on genuine personal reasons, they aren't necessarily wrong. The sister's anger might stem from feeling that the author isn't supporting her, but the author isn't in a position where they are being asked to give up their own child, just their sperm. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to prioritize their own desires, especially when the request doesn't prevent them from having children. However, the author could have handled the situation more sensitively. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a personal choice.\n"
