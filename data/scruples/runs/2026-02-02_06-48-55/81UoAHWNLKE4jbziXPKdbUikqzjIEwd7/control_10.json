Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The author is gay, and his sister is a lesbian. They're close, and the sister wants to have a family. The sister's partner is also 30, and they're married. The sister asked the author to donate sperm so that both her and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is worried because he wants to be a dad himself, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He's afraid that if he donates, he'll miss out on being a father. He said no, and the sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's reasons for refusing. He wants to have kids himself and is concerned about not being involved in the child's life. He feels that donating would make him an uncle instead of a father. The sister is upset because she thought he'd say yes. The author also mentions that he's gay and had issues with internalized homophobia. He's worried that by not donating, he's denying her a family. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to prioritize his own desire to be a parent over his sister's request? Well, donating sperm is a personal decision. People have the right to choose whether they want to be parents or donate for others. Even though his sister is in a same-sex relationship, the author has the autonomy to make this choice. \n\nThe sister might feel hurt because she expected support, especially given their close relationship. But the author isn't obligated to donate. The fact that he's concerned about his own future family plans is valid. He's not being selfish if he's making a decision based on his own life goals. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's need for a child is significant. However, the author isn't responsible for her ability to have children. She has other options, like IVF, which is legal. The author's refusal isn't preventing her from having children entirely. \n\nThe sister's reaction of calling him selfish might be because she didn't expect the refusal. But the author isn't wrong for having his own priorities. He's being honest about his feelings, even if it's hard. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's gay. There might be some internalized stigma, but his main reason is about wanting to be a father himself, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He has the right to prioritize his own desires and future plans. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
