Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is gay, 25, their sister is a lesbian, 30, and her wife is also 30. They're close, and the sister wants to have a family. She asked her brother to donate sperm for her and her partner, so the baby would have both their genes. The brother is uncomfortable with this because he wants to be a father himself, and he feels that donating would mean missing out on fatherhood. He said no, and his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, donating sperm is a big decision. It's not just about the physical act but also the emotional and ethical implications. The brother is worried about being stuck as an uncle and not being a father. He's 25, which isn't that old, but he wants kids. The sister is in a position where she might need sperm donation, which is legal in their country. \n\nBut the brother is refusing to help his sister achieve her dream of having a child. The sister might feel betrayed because they're close. She's arguing that he's being selfish by not helping her when he can. The brother's reasons are personal\u2014his desire to be a parent. However, he's not denying the sister her choice to have a family. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the right to one's own body is a big factor here. He's not legally obligated to donate, so from a rights perspective, he's not wrong. But from a relationship standpoint, his sister might feel he's not supporting her. But the brother is also prioritizing his own future and emotional needs. \n\nThere's also the aspect of his sister's argument that he's being selfish. But having the desire to be a father is a valid personal goal. The sister's needs are valid too, but he can't be expected to sacrifice his own dreams. \n\nAnother point: he mentions that he could donate now and still have kids later. But he hasn't done that yet because he wants to be the parent. That's a personal choice. It's not like he's refusing because of prejudice; he's making a choice based on his own life plans. \n\nThe sister's upset is understandable, but the brother isn't obligated to help. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. He could have been more empathetic in his explanation. But the core issue of refusing the donation isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). He's making a personal choice that's valid, even though it's causing tension. His reasons are legitimate, and he's not violating any rights of his sister by saying no.\n"
