Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to donate sperm for their sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, and the author is questioning their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is gay, as is the sister. The sister's partner is also there. The author is close to the sister and has supported her. The sister is asking for a significant contribution\u2014donating sperm\u2014which would allow her and her partner to have a genetically related child. The author is declining because they want to be a father themselves, even though they could still have kids later. The sister is hurt and feels the author is being selfish.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, donating sperm is a personal decision. The author has the right to say no, especially since it's their body and their future. However, the sister sees it as a favor to help her achieve her dream of having a child. The author argues that their desire to be a parent is valid and that they don't want to be just an uncle. \n\nI should think about autonomy versus familial obligations. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if they are close. However, the sister might feel there's an expectation because of their relationship. But the author isn't the only possible donor. They could use a sperm bank. The author's reasons are based on their own future plans, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe sister is upset because she feels rejected, but the author's decision isn't necessarily selfish. It's about their own aspirations. The author isn't harming the sister directly but is declining a request that the sister hoped would be accepted. There's no legal obligation, but emotionally, the sister might feel the author is prioritizing their own desires over the sister's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision may hurt the sister, the author isn't wrong to prioritize their own future family plans. It's a tough spot, but they have the right to say no. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
