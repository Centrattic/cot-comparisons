Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is gay, 25, and his sister is a lesbian who wants to start a family. She asked him to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be genetically related to the child. The author feels uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He explained his reasons, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The sister's perspective is that she's trying to build a family and sees her brother as the ideal donor because of the genetic connection. She might feel betrayed because they're close, and she expected support. On the other hand, the author's reasons are about his own future as a father, not wanting to give up the chance to have children himself. He's also concerned about the emotional impact of being a donor rather than a parent.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, it's about personal choices and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even if it's a close family member. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. His reasons, while they might seem self-centered to his sister, are valid because he's prioritizing his own dreams. However, the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. But the core issue is whether he's wrong for saying no.\n\nLegally, he can refuse. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The sister's emotional reaction is valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for having his own priorities. The key points are autonomy, personal goals, and mutual respect. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a choice that aligns with his own life plans, even if it's difficult for his sister.\n"
