Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. They want me to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, his sister is a 30-year-old lesbian who married her partner. They want to have a child using the author's sperm, which would be implanted into the sister-in-law. The author is close to his sister but refuses because he wants to be a parent himself, not just an uncle. He's worried about missing out on fatherhood, considering adoption and surrogacy are difficult. His sister is upset, calling him selfish, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's personal desire to have children justifies his refusal, especially since he's not a parent yet and his sister is seeking help. On one hand, the sister has a legitimate desire to have a biological child with her partner, and the author is in a position to help. On the other hand, the author has his own dreams of parenthood and isn't comfortable with the idea of being just an uncle. \n\nI need to weigh these two perspectives. The author is not obligated to donate sperm, as it's a personal medical decision. However, the sister might feel betrayed, given their close relationship and her perception of his refusal as selfish. The author argues that his desire to be a full parent is valid, but the sister's need for genetic ties is also valid. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspect. Donating sperm is a significant decision with long-term implications. The author has the right to prioritize his own future, especially if he feels strongly about being a parent. However, the sister's feelings and their relationship dynamics are important too. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if his refusal is seen as prioritizing his own desires over his sister's needs, especially if she feels he's being selfish. But if he's not legally or ethically obligated to donate, then his decision is his to make. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong. \n\nIn the end, the key factors are personal choice, the impact on the relationship, and mutual understanding. The author's decision is personal, but the way he communicated it and how it affects his sister matters. If he explained his reasons clearly and they're valid, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if he dismissed her needs without consideration, maybe he is. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014calling him names and accusing him of jealousy might escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because it's his body and his choice, but there's a gray area. The sister's perspective is also important, but the final decision lies with the author. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
