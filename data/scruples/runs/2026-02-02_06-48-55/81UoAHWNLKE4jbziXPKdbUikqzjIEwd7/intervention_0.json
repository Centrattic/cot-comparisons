Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. They're both gay, which the author mentions as a joke about their parents. The sister wants to have a family and asked the author to donate sperm, which would go into the sister-in-law (not the sister herself). The author is uncomfortable and refuses because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just an uncle. They feel that donating sperm now might take away their chance to have their own kids later, especially considering adoption and surrogacy are difficult options. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, and they\u2019re questioning if they\u2019re the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They have a strong emotional desire to be a parent, which is valid. They\u2019re worried about missing out on fatherhood, and they\u2019re not comfortable with the idea of being a sperm donor without parental rights. Their reasons are personal and relate to their own dreams and fears. It's important to respect someone's autonomy over their body and reproductive choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to build a family and has approached her brother for help. She might feel that her sibling is being uncooperative when she's seeking support. The author mentions that logically, they should put their feelings aside, which suggests internal conflict.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethics. Donating sperm is a personal decision. While the sister might feel hurt or see the refusal as selfish, the author isn't obligated to do this. The key point here is consent and the right to bodily autonomy. The author isn't causing harm by saying no; they\u2019re prioritizing their own future family plans. The sister's frustration is understandable, but that doesn't make the author wrong for declining.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to the sister's situation. The author points out that IVF is available for lesbian couples, but for them, options are more limited. This disparity might contribute to their anxiety about future parenthood. It's a matter of personal circumstances affecting their decision.\n\nThe sister's emotional reaction is significant. She's upset and feels betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. However, the author isn't the one imposing; they're the ones being asked to make a personal sacrifice. The sister's accusations of selfishness might not hold up because the author is making a choice based on their own needs and desires, not out of spite.\n\nI should also think about whether the author's reasons are valid. Wanting to be an active parent is reasonable. The author isn't denying the sister the chance to have a child entirely; they\u2019re just not willing to be the sperm donor. The sister can explore other options, like using a different donor. The author isn't in a position where they\u2019re blocking her from having children entirely, just refusing a specific request.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the author and sister are close, and this situation is straining their relationship. However, the author isn't acting out of malice. They\u2019ve explained their feelings, even if the sister isn't accepting it. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own desires over their sister's needs here.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that while the sister is disappointed, the author is not in the wrong for refusing. They have the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The sister's hurt feelings don't negate the author's right to say no. The author isn't being selfish in a malicious way but is making a choice based on their personal goals and emotional state.\n"
