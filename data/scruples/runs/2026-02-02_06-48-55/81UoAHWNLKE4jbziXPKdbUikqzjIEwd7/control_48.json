Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and sister's wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would go into her partner. The author is gay and close to his sister but feels conflicted. He doesn't want to donate because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle. He's worried about missing out on fatherhood and the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other side, the sister is upset and feels rejected. She might see her brother's refusal as selfish, especially since she's trying to build a family. The author acknowledges that his sister is a good mother and wants her to have a family but feels his own desires are valid. \n\nLegally, sperm donation is a serious decision. In many places, donating to relatives might have implications, and the donor could have legal or emotional responsibilities. However, the author is not in a position where he wants to be a parent, so he's trying to protect his own future. \n\nThe sister's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't obligated to donate, especially if it causes him distress. People have the right to their own life choices. However, the sister's perspective is also valid; she's trying to create a family and feels supported by others. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's being accused of being selfish, but he's also standing up for his own dreams. It's a personal decision, and while the sister's needs are important, the author's feelings and future plans shouldn't be dismissed. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He's made a personal choice that's difficult but based on his own desires. It's not entirely his fault, and the sister should understand his perspective even if she disagrees. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
