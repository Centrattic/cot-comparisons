Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is gay and his sister is a lesbian. They're both close, and the sister wants to have a child with her partner. She asked her brother to donate sperm so that their child would have both their genes. The brother declined because he wants to be a father himself in the future. He feels that donating sperm would take away his chance to be a parent, even though he knows he could still have kids later. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here are personal choice versus family expectations. The author is making a decision based on his own desires and fears about not being able to have children. On the other hand, his sister sees this as a selfish refusal, especially since he's in a position to help her achieve her dream without it affecting his ability to have children immediately. \n\nI need to think about whether the author's reasons are valid. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their body and their future. Even though he could potentially have children later, his desire to be a parent is legitimate. However, his sister is in a situation where she needs his help to have a child, which is a significant life goal. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The sister's feelings are hurt, but does that mean the author is wrong for saying no? The author isn't obligated to donate sperm. It's a personal choice. However, considering the close relationship, maybe he could have found a way to explain his reasons without making her feel rejected. The sister's perspective is important too; she might feel that her brother isn't supporting her because he's prioritizing his own potential future over her current need.\n\nBut then again, the author's feelings are valid. He's not being unreasonable for wanting to be a father. The sister's accusations of selfishness might be unfair, but the author's refusal is based on his own life goals. Legally and ethically, he's not in the wrong for refusing. However, emotionally, the situation is more complex. He might be seen as selfish in the context of their relationship, even if his reasons are understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether we prioritize personal autonomy over family expectations. Since the author isn't being forced to do this and his reasons are legitimate, he's not in the wrong. However, the way he handled the situation might affect his relationship, but that's a different matter than being morally wrong.\n"
