Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is gay, as is their sister. She wants to have a family with her partner and is asking her brother to donate sperm. The author is close to her but feels uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself someday. He explains that he wants to be fully involved in a child's life, not just an uncle. They're in a country where surrogacy isn't legal, but IVF for lesbian couples is. The sister is upset, calling him selfish, and he's questioning if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are the author's reasons for refusal versus the sister's needs and their relationship. The author's reasons include his desire to experience fatherhood, his concerns about adoption/surrogacy challenges, and not wanting to be an \"uncle\" to a child. The sister feels betrayed and it's causing a rift.\n\nI should think about autonomy and personal choice here. The author has the right to make decisions about his own body. Donating sperm is a big commitment that affects his future. Even though the sister is in a difficult situation, the author's personal goals and feelings about fatherhood are valid. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is prioritizing his own wishes over helping a close family member. But it's important to note that his refusal isn't because of any malicious intent. He's genuinely conflicted and hurt by the situation. \n\nThe sister's feelings are also important. She's in a position where she might not have many options, and this was her idea to have a biological connection. The author's response might feel dismissive, but he's explaining his reasoning. It's possible that communication could help, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to donate. The sister is asking, not demanding. So, the author isn't wrong for saying no. His reasons are personal and valid. The sister's reaction might be hurtful, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice based on his own desires and future plans. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own path to fatherhood.\n"
