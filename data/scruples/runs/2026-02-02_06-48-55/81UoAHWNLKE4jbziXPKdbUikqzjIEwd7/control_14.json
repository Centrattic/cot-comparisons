Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his lesbian sister and her partner. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but he doesn't want to because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want his child to be raised by someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister is in a situation where she and her partner want to have a child with both their genes. Since the author is gay, donating sperm would allow the sister to carry the child, giving both her and her partner a biological connection. But the author has valid reasons for refusing. He wants to be a father himself, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He feels that by donating, he's giving up the chance to be a dad, which is his dream.\n\nThe sister is upset and thinks he's being selfish. But is he really in the wrong? Well, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and future. The author isn't obligated to donate his sperm. His reasons are personal and about his own desires for fatherhood. It's not like he's being cruel or indifferent; he actually wants the best for his sister and is conflicted. \n\nAlso, the sister's accusations about internalized homophobia might be unfounded. The author already accepted his sexuality and has his own aspirations. The problem here is about conflicting personal goals. The sister wants a family, and the author wants to be a father. Both are valid. \n\nThe sister might feel hurt because she expected support, but the author can't be forced to sacrifice his own dreams. It's important to respect each other's choices. Maybe they need to have a more open conversation to understand each other's perspectives. But in terms of right or wrong, it's not clear-cut. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own wishes, even if it's hard to say no to a close family member.\n"
