Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her partner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister wants to have a family and is asking her brother for sperm donation. The brother is gay, which means he can't have children through a traditional route. He's also concerned about his own future of becoming a parent, as adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal in his country. He values being fully involved in the child's life, which is why he's hesitant to donate.\n\nThe sister is upset, feeling that he's being selfish and not supporting her. The brother feels that his personal dreams and concerns are valid. The question is whether his decision is wrong.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, adults have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The brother isn't obligated to donate, even if it's for his sister. His reasons are personal and relate to his own aspirations. It's important to respect individual autonomy here. \n\nThe sister's request is understandable, but the brother has the right to prioritize his own wishes. The fact that he's considering the implications of his decision and the emotional impact shows he's thoughtful, not just selfish. \n\nThe sister's reaction of calling him a selfish jerk might be hurtful, but the brother isn't in the wrong just because he declined. The core issue is about personal choice and the right to control one's reproductive materials. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His refusal is based on valid personal reasons, and he's not obligated to comply with a request that conflicts with his own life plans.\n"
