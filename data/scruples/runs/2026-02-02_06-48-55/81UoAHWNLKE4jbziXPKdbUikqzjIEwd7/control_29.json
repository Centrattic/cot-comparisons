Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is gay and wants to have kids themselves in the future. They mentioned that adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal where they are. So their reasons for saying no are based on their own desire to be a parent. They don't want to donate sperm because they want to be fully involved in their own child's life. That makes sense on a personal level. They're prioritizing their own future family plans.\n\nOn the other hand, their sister is trying to build a family and sees the author's sperm as a way to have a genetically related child. She's upset because she feels rejected and maybe even like her brother is being selfish. The author acknowledges that they have an \"infinite supply\" of sperm and that their sister only needs a sample. That might make the sister feel like her needs are being ignored.\n\nBut the author is clear that they want to be a parent themselves. It's their dream. Should they sacrifice that to help their sister? Or is it okay to prioritize their own goals? The sister might feel entitled to their help because of their close relationship, but the author has the right to their own reproductive choices. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction includes accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia, which might not be fair. The author's reasons are about their own life goals, not about homophobia. The sister's frustration is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to meet her needs if it conflicts with their own.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a big factor here. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body. Even though their sister is in a position where she wants to use their sperm, the author isn't required to agree. It's a personal choice. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. They're not causing harm beyond their own decision; they're not forcing the sister to not have a family. They're just choosing not to participate.\n\nThe sister could explore other options for sperm donation. The author's reasons are valid, even if the sister might not see it that way. So, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own decisions about their future and their body.\n"
