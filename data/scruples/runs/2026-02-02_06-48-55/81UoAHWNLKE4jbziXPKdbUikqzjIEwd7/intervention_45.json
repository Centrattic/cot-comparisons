Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, 25, and the sister is 30, wanting to have a family. The sister asked the author to donate sperm for her and her partner to have a child. The author is conflicted because they want to be a dad someday and don't want to be just an uncle. They said no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and personal aspects here. On one hand, the sister is seeking help to have a child, and the author is a close family member. On the other, the author has their own dreams of being a parent and feels that donating sperm would take away from that opportunity. \n\nDonating sperm is a big decision. It's not just a one-time thing; it has long-term implications. The author might be right to feel that their desire to be a parent is valid. They might also be concerned about the emotional and legal aspects of being a sperm donor versus a traditional parent. For example, if they donate sperm anonymously, there could be future complications if the child wants to know their biological father. Also, in some cases, sperm donors can be considered legal fathers, which could complicate the author's personal plans.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, especially if the author is honest about their feelings. However, the author could be considered selfish if they're prioritizing their own desires over their sister's needs, especially given their close relationship. But it's also understandable that someone would want to be a parent and not just a donor. The line between being reasonable and being selfish can be blurry here.\n\nLegally, the situation might vary by country. In some places, sperm donation for family members might require legal agreements to define the donor's rights and responsibilities, which could add another layer of complexity. If the author isn't prepared for any potential role in the child's life, that could be a problem. However, if they've made it clear that they don't want to be involved, then it's a different scenario.\n\nThe sister might feel hurt because she expected support from her sibling, which is natural. But the author's feelings about wanting to be a parent themselves are also valid. The key here is whether the author communicated their reasons clearly and respectfully. If they did, then it's a matter of differing priorities. It's possible that both sides have valid points, but the sister's expectations might not align with the author's personal goals.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that family should come first, but others would support the author's right to their own family planning. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even to a close family member. The sister should respect that, even if they're disappointed. The author isn't in the wrong just because they said no; they have a right to their own future as parents.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their decision, and it's their body and future. The sister's hurt is understandable, but the author's decision is a personal one. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
