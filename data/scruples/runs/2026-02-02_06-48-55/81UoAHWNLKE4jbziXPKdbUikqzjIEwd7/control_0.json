Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's 25 and gay, is being asked by his sister and her wife to donate sperm so the sister can carry the child. The author refuses because he wants to be a dad himself, not just an uncle. He feels conflicted between his sister's needs and his own dreams. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is close to the author and has always supported him. She's trying to start a family, which is a big deal. The request is for sperm donation, which is a personal and intimate matter. The author's reasons are about his own desire to have children and not just be a donor. \n\nIs it selfish? Well, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The author is not obligated to donate, even though his sister might feel hurt. The sister might feel that since they're close, he should help her achieve her dream. But the author's dream is to be a father, which is valid. \n\nThe sister is upset and calls him selfish, but maybe she's projecting her own feelings of rejection. The author isn't denying her a family, just not providing a specific option. There are other ways to have children, like IVF with a donor. The author isn't in the wrong if he's making a choice based on his own values and future. \n\nAlso, the author is considering the emotional impact. He doesn't want to be an uncle; he wants to be a dad. That's his personal goal. While it might seem like he's prioritizing his own desires over his sister's, it's important to respect individual autonomy. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's his body and his choice, even if it's hard for the sister to accept.\n"
