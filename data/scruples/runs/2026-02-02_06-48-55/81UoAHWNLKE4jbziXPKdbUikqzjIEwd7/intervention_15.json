Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The situation is that the sister wants to have a child and is asking her brother for sperm. The author is gay and close to his sister but is uncomfortable with the idea because he wants to be a father himself someday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is close to his sister, who has been supportive. He's being asked to help her start a family, which is a big deal. But he's declining because he wants to have his own children. Is that selfish? Well, personal desires are valid. The sister might feel hurt because she's asking for help, and the author is declining. But is it his responsibility to help?\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision is about his own future as a parent. He's not willing to sacrifice his chance to be a father for his sister's needs. That's a personal choice. On the other hand, his sister might feel rejected or that he's not supporting her. \n\nI should also think about the context. The author is not in a position where he's being forced to donate. He's making a choice based on his own desires. The sister is using her brother's sperm not for herself but her partner, which the author is okay with in terms of the procedure but not the emotional aspect. \n\nThe author mentions that donating sperm is a simple process for him, but he's prioritizing his own potential future. Is that unreasonable? Maybe the sister expects him to help since it's easy for him, but the author's emotional attachment to being a parent is a valid concern. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be a parent himself. However, the sister's feelings are important too. But ultimately, the author's right to decide his own life and future is key here. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that since it's an easy request, he should say yes, but that's a different perspective.\n"
