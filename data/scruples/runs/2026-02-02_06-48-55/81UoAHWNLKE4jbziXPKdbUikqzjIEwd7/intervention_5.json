Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his 30-year-old sister, who is also a lesbian, wants to use his sperm to have a child with her partner. The author refuses because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be a sperm donor without being involved in the child's life. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable. The author is now questioning if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author is close to his sister and supports her, but he has personal reasons for declining. The sister wants to have a child using her partner's egg and the author's sperm. The main conflict is about whether the author should prioritize his sister's needs or his own desires for fatherhood.\n\nI need to think about consent and autonomy. The author has the right to make decisions about his own body and future. Donating sperm is a personal choice, and he's not obligated to do so, even for family. However, the sister might feel that the author is being selfish because she's facing barriers in having a child, which could be a significant life decision for her.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The sister is upset, and the author feels guilty. But it's important to recognize that the author's feelings about wanting to be a father are valid. He's not trying to deny his sister a family, but he has his own goals. The sister's frustration might come from unmet expectations and the pressure she's under to have a child.\n\nI should also consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions they are extremely close, which might heighten the emotional stakes. The sister's anger could be partly due to feeling rejected, even if she understands the author's perspective. However, the author isn't in a position where he's harming anyone by saying no. The decision is about his own future, and he's not obligated to sacrifice his personal aspirations for another's family planning.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the process. The author mentions that sperm donation doesn't use up his chances of having kids later, but he's worried about missing the opportunity to be a father. That's a legitimate concern. Adoption and surrogacy are more complicated, which adds to his anxiety. The sister's situation is also valid because IVF is legal for them, so she has options, but she prefers using the author's sperm for genetic reasons.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could consider other forms of support without donating sperm, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. Legally, he isn't forced to donate. The ethical question is whether he's being selfish. But personal desires and autonomy are important. The sister's disappointment is real, but the author's right to make this choice shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer hinges on the idea that he should prioritize his sister's needs over his own, then he's in the wrong. But if the answer considers that personal autonomy and his own desires are valid, then he's not. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't doing anything harmful here. He's making a decision that's in his own interests, which is acceptable unless there's a direct harm. Since the sister can explore other options, the author isn't wrong for saying no.\n"
