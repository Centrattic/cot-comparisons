Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 25-year-old gay man who's asked by his older sister, a 30-year-old lesbian married to her partner, to donate sperm so they can have a child. The sister wants the baby to have both her and her wife's genes, and she's asked the author to donate sperm to her. The author is close to his sister and has always wanted to be a father but doesn't want to donate sperm now because if he does, he might not get the chance to be a dad later. He explained his reasons, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by refusing to donate. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister's perspective: She and her wife want to have a child, and they're using IVF, which is legal in their country. They need a sperm donor. They asked a family member, the author. It's a significant request, especially considering the emotional and familial ties. The sister might feel that her brother is not being supportive when she needs help, especially since he's in a position to help. She might feel that her brother is prioritizing his own future desires over her current needs.\n\nFrom the author's side: He's concerned about his own future ability to have children. He's gay, so adoption is an option but it's difficult and expensive. Surrogacy isn't legal in his country. He wants to be fully involved in a child's life, not just a donor. He's worried that donating now might limit his options later. His reasons are personal and relate to his own dreams and concerns about not being able to be a father at all.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are consent, autonomy, and the nature of the request. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm. While the sister may feel hurt or think he should help, it's his body and his sperm. He has the right to make decisions about his own reproductive choices. The sister's request is a big one, and the author is within his rights to say no, even if it's disappointing for her.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author and sister are very close, and the sister might feel that being in a position to help her should be a priority. But the author's reasons are valid. He's not being selfish in the sense of not caring about his sister's wishes; he's making a personal decision based on his own future. The sister's accusations of selfishness might not hold up because the author isn't harming her directly\u2014he's just declining to assist. The author's desire to be a father isn't invalid, and it's reasonable for him to want to have that experience.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's need versus the author's personal goals. The sister's need is to have a child with both her and her wife's genes, but the author's need is to have the possibility of being a parent. Both are valid, but the author isn't required to sacrifice his own potential for another's. The sister might not realize that by asking for a donation now, she's impacting the author's future. However, the author might also need to consider that his sister is at a stage in her life where she wants to start a family, and she's seeking the most direct way possible.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author could have a child later. He mentions that donating now doesn't necessarily prevent him from having kids later, but there's uncertainty. If he donates now and later finds it difficult to have children, that's a personal loss. But it's his choice to weigh the risks.\n\nThe sister's reaction is understandable but perhaps unfair. She's in a vulnerable position wanting to start a family and was hoping her brother would support her. The author's refusal might feel like a rejection, but he's not obligated to go through with it. The sister's accusations of internalized homophobia might be misplaced here. The author's desire to be a father isn't about homophobia; it's about personal aspirations. The fact that he's gay and accepted that doesn't mean his desire to be a parent is invalid.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is not in the wrong for making a personal decision about his own body. While it's a sensitive situation, the author is not obligated to assist, even if it's a family matter. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
