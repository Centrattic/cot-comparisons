Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, their sister is 30. The sister is a lesbian, married to her partner. They want to have a child using the author's sperm. The author is gay and also wants to be a father but doesn't want to donate because they want to be actively involved in the child's life. They feel they can't just be an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for saying no. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help from her sibling, someone who's supposed to be close. The author is using their own desire to be a parent as a reason to say no. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own potential future over their sister's current need. Also, the author mentions that they can still have kids later, so the refusal might seem selfish from the sister's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons. They want to experience parenthood and aren't willing to be a genetic father without being involved. It's their body, and they have the right to make decisions about their own reproductive choices. Their feelings about wanting to be a parent are legitimate. The sister's request is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to comply. The sister could explore other options like a sperm bank or other donors.\n\nThe key points are autonomy and personal choice. The author isn't in a position where they owe the sister their sperm. While the sister is upset, the author isn't being unethical or wrong for setting their own boundaries. The sister's hurt feelings are understandable, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own future family plans. The decision is personal and not about selfishness per se, but about personal values and goals.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is wrong, but considering the analysis, the author's stance is reasonable. They're making a choice that affects their own life goals, and it's not about the sister's needs versus their own in a selfish way. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
