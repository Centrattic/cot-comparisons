Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister, a lesbian, is 30 and wants to have a baby. She's asked him to donate sperm so she and her wife can have a child. The sperm would go into the sister-in-law, not the sister. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to donate his sperm for her family since he might not get the chance to have kids later. He said no, and his sister is upset, calling him selfish. The author is now wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is wrong, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. \n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help to build her family, which is a big deal. The author is a relative who's being asked to contribute genetically. The sister might feel hurt because her sibling is turning down a request that she sees as a way to create a family with both her and her partner's genes. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in a significant life decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has his own desires and concerns. He wants to be a father and doesn't want to give up the opportunity to have a biological child. He's worried about not being able to have kids later, especially with adoption being difficult and surrogacy not legal. His feelings are valid because personal reproductive choices are important. He's not obligated to donate sperm, even if it helps his sister. \n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. People have the right to make decisions about their bodies, including sperm donation. The sister's request is understandable, but the author isn't required to comply, especially if it conflicts with his personal goals. The sister's reaction might be hurtful, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong in saying no. \n\nThe sister might feel wronged because she was hoping for support, but the author's reasons are about his own future. The question is whether prioritizing one's own dreams over a family member's request is wrong. It's a personal choice, and while it might cause strain, it's not inherently unethical. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not being homophobic or jealous, which the sister accused him of. The key issue is about his personal reproductive aspirations versus his sister's needs. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say the author is being selfish, but others would respect his decision to prioritize his own goals. The law might not require him to donate, so it's a matter of ethics and personal values. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, it's a complex situation. He's not legally obligated, and his feelings are legitimate. However, the sister is also in a position where she needs support. The answer might depend on whether the author is being considerate of both his own desires and his sister's. The author tried to explain his feelings, but the sister is upset. It's possible the author is in the right because he's making a personal choice, even if it causes hurt. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
