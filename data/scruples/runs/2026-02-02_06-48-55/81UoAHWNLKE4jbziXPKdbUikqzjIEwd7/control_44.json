Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a man refusing to donate sperm to his lesbian sister and her wife. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, his sister is 30. They're very close. The sister wants to have a family and is asking him to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be genetically related to the child. He's gay, and she's a lesbian. The sperm would go into the sister-in-law. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to have a child he's not involved in. He feels it's about his own desires versus his sister's needs.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister is in a situation where she wants to start a family and is asking a close relative for help. The author is refusing, which could hurt her. He's accused of being selfish. On the other hand, the author has his own dreams of fatherhood and is making a personal choice. He's not obligated to donate his sperm, even if he's close to her. \n\nThe sister might feel let down, but the author's feelings are valid too. The article mentions that he's considering adoption and surrogacy, which aren't easy in his country. He's prioritizing his own future as a parent. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize your own desires? Maybe not. People have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Donating sperm is a big commitment, and he's choosing not to because he wants to be a father himself. His sister's needs are important, but so is his right to his own family plans. \n\nHowever, the sister might see this as a lack of support. But the author isn't being mean-spirited; he's explaining his reasons. The sister's upset is understandable, but the author isn't in the wrong for having his own boundaries. The answer might be B, that he's not in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his own family plans.\n"
