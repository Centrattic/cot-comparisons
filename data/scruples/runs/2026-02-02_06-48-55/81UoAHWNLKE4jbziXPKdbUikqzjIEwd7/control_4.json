Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The writer is gay, as is their sister. The sister wants a child with both her and her partner's genes, so she's asking the brother to donate sperm. He's refusing because he wants to be a father himself in the future, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is seeking a way to have a genetically related child, which is a valid desire. The brother is declining because of his own future plans. Is it selfish? Well, he's explaining his reasons, which are about his personal dreams and concerns about adoption/surrogacy options. The sister's reaction is emotional, calling him selfish, but the brother's reasons are about his own values and aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her needs are being overlooked. However, the brother has a right to his own reproductive choices. Donating sperm is a significant decision, and he's not obligated to do so just because they're family. The fact that he's being asked to give up something he wants for himself (fatherhood) in favor of her using his genes without him being involved in parenting is a key point.\n\nThe sister's use of terms like internalized homophobia and jealousy might be a projection or misunderstanding. The brother's reasoning isn't about homophobia but about his personal desire to be a parent. The sister's needs are valid, but so are the brother's. It's a conflict between their personal goals. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to respect each person's autonomy. The brother isn't being a complete jerk; he's making a choice based on his own life plans. While the sister is hurt, her needs don't override his right to say no. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his own values and future goals, and it's not inherently selfish to prioritize one's own desires in such a context.\n"
