Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her partner. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would go into her via IVF. The author is gay and doesn't want to be a father now because he wants to have his own kids someday, and he's worried about not being involved in the child's life. His sister feels hurt and calls him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. He's not opposing his sister having kids but is prioritizing his own future desires. He's concerned about not being a father and the emotional impact of donating sperm. On the other hand, his sister is in a position where she wants to have a child with her partner, and using his sperm is a way to have a biological connection. \n\nThe question is whether his refusal makes him the asshole. It's important to think about autonomy and personal choice. Donating sperm is a significant decision, and he has the right to say no. However, the sister argues that he's being selfish. But is it really selfish if he's not willing to compromise his own future? \n\nAlso, the sister's feelings are hurt, which is valid. They're close, and she was hoping for support. But does that mean he's obligated to say yes? Maybe not. Everyone has different priorities, and while it's sad that the relationship is strained, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his own goals.\n\nAnother angle: sperm donation to relatives can have complex emotional and legal implications. The author might be right to consider how this would affect him in the long run. Even though he could have kids later, the desire to be a parent is strong. So, his reasons are personal and valid.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about whether someone oversteps. Here, the author didn't overstep; he's asserting his own boundaries. His sister might feel let down, but that doesn't make him the asshole. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice, even if it's difficult for the sister.\n"
