Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The situation involves family dynamics, personal desires, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the author's main reason for refusal is their own desire to have children and be actively involved as a father. They feel that donating sperm would mean not having the chance to be a parent, which is a valid personal goal. It's important to respect someone's aspirations, especially regarding their family planning.\n\nThe sister is upset, feeling rejected and accused the author of being selfish. But is the author really being selfish? They are prioritizing their own future family over helping their sister, which is a personal choice. However, family relationships can be complex. The sister might feel entitled to the author's help, given their close bond and the fact that the author is a sibling. But the author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their body and reproductive choices.\n\nLegally, in many places, individuals have the right to decide whether to donate sperm, regardless of family ties. Ethically, while the sister's desire for a family is understandable, the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own dreams. The sister's reaction includes accusations of internalized homophobia and jealousy, which might be a way to cope with rejection but doesn't negate the author's legitimate feelings.\n\nThe author also mentions that they considered the situation carefully and explained their reasons. They acknowledge that their sister might see them as selfish, but they are standing by their decision. The key here is whether the refusal is unjustified. Since the author isn't causing harm beyond not helping, and their own desires are valid, it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nHowever, the emotional impact on the sister is significant. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author hasn't been offered alternatives. Still, the decision to donate sperm is personal. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own future family. The answer should be B.\n"
