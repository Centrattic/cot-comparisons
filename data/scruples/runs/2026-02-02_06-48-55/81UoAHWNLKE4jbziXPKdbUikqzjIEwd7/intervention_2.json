Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, and the sister is also a lesbian. The sister wants to have a biological child with her partner using the author's sperm. The author is reluctant because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just the sperm donor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are very close, and the sister feels rejected. The author's reasons are about their own desire to be a parent and not just a sperm donor. Is that a valid reason? \n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help to build her family, which is a significant life step. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their own future over the sister's needs. But on the other hand, the author has a legitimate desire to be a father, which is a personal goal. \n\nThe sister is upset and feels the author is selfish, but the author is explaining their emotional reasoning. The key here is whether the author's decision is reasonable given their personal values and future plans. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries for their own life and future. However, the way they handled it might have been hurtful. They could have tried to find another solution or suggested alternatives, but ultimately, it's their choice. The sister's needs are important, but so is the author's right to make decisions about their body and future. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
