Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister, who is a lesbian, wants to use his sperm to have a child with her partner. The author is also gay. He's close to his sister and wants the best for her, but he's uncomfortable with donating sperm because he wants to be a father himself someday. He feels that if he donates, he'd just be an uncle, not a dad. He turned her down, and she's upset, calling him selfish and such. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister wants to start a family and sees the author's sperm as a way to have a biological child. She might feel that the author is in a good position to help, especially since they're close. On the other hand, the author has his own aspirations of being a father. He's concerned about not being able to fulfill his dream because donating sperm now would mean that child isn't his. He also mentions practical issues like adoption and surrogacy being difficult, so he's under pressure to decide.\n\nThe question is whether his refusal makes him the asshole. From what I read, the author isn't refusing because of prejudice or lack of care for his sister. He's genuinely conflicted because he wants to support his sister but also has his own goals. He's not making a decision out of spite; it's about his own future. However, his sister is clearly hurt, which is understandable. She might feel like her needs are being ignored, especially if she's putting a lot of hope into this.\n\nBut is he being selfish? He's not a parent yet, so he's not in a position where he's already a father and can't help. He's making a choice based on his own future. It's not like he's refusing to help without any valid reason. Also, the sister's partner is involved, and it's their family they're trying to build. The author is being asked to contribute something personal\u2014his sperm\u2014which is a big deal. His feelings about wanting to be a father are valid. Maybe the sister is struggling to understand his perspective because she's focused on her own desire for a child.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspects. If he donates sperm, there might be legal implications about parental rights. If he's not the legal father, that could complicate things. The author might have concerns about that, even if he didn't mention it. Also, there's the emotional aspect of having a child he's not involved with. For some people, that's a deal-breaker.\n\nThe sister's reaction might stem from feeling that her needs are being denied, especially by someone she's close to. But does that make the author selfish? He's not obligated to donate. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The author is prioritizing his own dreams, which he's explained are important to him. It's a tough spot, but it's not clear that he's wrong for choosing himself in this case.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a personal choice based on his own desires and circumstances. His sister's needs are important, but so are his. The answer would be B (No), he's not the asshole.\n"
