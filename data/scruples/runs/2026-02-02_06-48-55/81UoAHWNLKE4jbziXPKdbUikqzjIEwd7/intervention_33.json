Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's sister wants to donate his sperm to have a kid with her wife. The author is gay and wants to be a dad, so he says no. The sister is upset, calling him selfish. The author is wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is close to his sister, and she's asking for a big favor. He's not willing to donate sperm because he wants to be a father himself. The sister is a lesbian, and using his sperm would mean she and her wife can have a biological child. But he's worried about not being the dad, just an uncle. The sister feels betrayed, and he's questioning his own reasons.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, donating sperm is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to do it, even though they're siblings and close. The sister's request is valid because she wants to start a family, but the author has his own desires. The sister might feel he's not supporting her, but his reasons are about his own future as a parent.\n\nOn one hand, the sister might feel like he should help since they're family, but on the other, the author has the right to decide what he's comfortable with. The idea that he's being selfish is debatable. He's not harming her directly; he's just not willing to compromise his own goals. It's a conflict between his wishes and hers.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact: making the sister sad is tough, but he's not forcing her to have kids without his help. There might be other options for her, like using a sperm donor. However, he mentions that IVF is legal but surrogacy isn't, and adoption is hard. So maybe she's relying on him because it's easier.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, I think the author isn't in the wrong. People have the right to choose how they use their bodies and their genetic material. Even though the sister is upset, the author's decision is based on his own life goals. It's a tough situation, but he's not obligated to donate sperm. The sister might need to accept his choice and explore other options. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
