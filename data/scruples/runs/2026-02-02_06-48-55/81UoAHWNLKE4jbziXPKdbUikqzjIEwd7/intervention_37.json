Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is being asked by their sister to donate sperm for her and her wife to start a family. The sister wants the author's sperm to ensure both her and her partner's genes are in the child. The author is reluctant because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, and there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and feelings of both parties. The author's main argument is that they want to have their own children and don't want to give up the chance to be a parent. The sister, on the other hand, is trying to build a family and sees the author as a willing participant since they are close. \n\nI remember that donating sperm is a big decision. It's not just about giving a sample; it can have emotional and legal implications. The author is justified in considering their own future. However, the sister is in a position where she needs support, and the author is a family member who's being offered as a solution. \n\nBut, family dynamics can be complex. The sister might feel that the author is choosing their own desires over their sister's needs. The author might feel their personal goals are being dismissed. The key here is consent. The author isn't obligated to help unless there was a prior agreement. Since there wasn't, the author has the right to say no. \n\nHowever, the way the author explains their reasons might come off as self-centered. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own potential future over helping their sister in a meaningful way. But the author isn't being cruel for having those feelings. It's about personal choice. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to pursue their own family goals. However, the sister's disappointment is understandable. The author could have handled the rejection more sensitively, perhaps offering alternative support. But the decision itself isn't wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has valid personal reasons and isn't obligated to donate.\n"
