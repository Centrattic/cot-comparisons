Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is being asked if they're at fault for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The main points here are about family dynamics, personal boundaries, and the emotional impact on both sides.\n\nFirst, the author explains their reasons clearly. They want to have children themselves in the future and feel that donating sperm for this scenario would mean they wouldn't be the primary parent. They also mention the legal and process challenges they might face if they try to have kids later. Their reasons are about personal goals and feelings, not about denying their sister the chance to have a family. \n\nOn the other side, the sister is upset, calling the author selfish. She wants to have a child with her partner and sees the author's sperm as a way to include both their genes. She might feel hurt because the author is close to her and she expected support. However, the author is also in a position where they need to consider their own future and emotional well-being. \n\nThe key here is whether it's reasonable for the author to set such a boundary. People have different priorities and rights over their bodies. The author isn't preventing their sister from having a family entirely; they're just declining to be the sperm donor. They can still support her in other ways. The sister might have strong feelings, but the author's decision is about their own desires and fears. \n\nSaying \"AITA\" often hinges on whether the person's actions are seen as selfish or not. While the sister is in a tough spot, the author isn't obligated to donate their sperm. Their reasons are valid for themselves. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own future and emotional health. They should probably communicate better to mend the relationship, but the core decision isn't inherently wrong.\n"
