Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The author is gay, and the sister is a lesbian. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, so that both she and her partner can be biologically related. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister is seeking a way to have a child, which is a common desire for many couples. The author is in a position where they could help, but they choose not to because they want their own family. The author argues that they want to experience parenthood fully, not just be a sperm donor. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, the sister is in a situation where she can't conceive through traditional means, so using a sperm donor is necessary. The author is a relative and might be a convenient option. However, the author also has their own goals. The key point is that the author is not obligated to donate their sperm. It's a personal choice. The sister might feel hurt because they expected the author to be willing, especially given their close relationship. \n\nBut is the author wrong for prioritizing their own desires? In some contexts, people might say that family comes first, but others might argue that individuals have the right to make personal decisions about their bodies. The sister might have explored other options, like using an anonymous donor, but maybe they prefer a family member. The author isn't forcing them; they just don't want to be the donor. \n\nThe sister's frustration is understandable, but the author isn't in the wrong for having personal boundaries. It's a sensitive situation, but the decision to donate sperm is a personal one. The author isn't denying their sister the opportunity entirely\u2014they're just not the donor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their own future wishes. The sister might need to accept the answer, even if it's disappointing. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're being honest about their limitations.\n"
