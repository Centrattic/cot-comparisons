Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author is gay and close to their sister, who is a lesbian. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, so both she and her partner can be genetically related. The author refuses because they want to be a father themselves in the future, not just an uncle. They feel that donating would mean missing out on fatherhood.\n\nNow, the sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable. The author is questioning if they are being an asshole. The key points here are autonomy, personal goals, and family dynamics.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, each person has the right to make decisions about their own body. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm unless they have a prior agreement, which they don't. Their reasons\u2014wanting to have their own children\u2014seem valid. The sister's desire to have a child is important, but so is the author's desire to be a parent. \n\nHowever, the sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own future over their sister's needs. But it's not as simple as one being right or wrong. The author's decision is personal and based on their own life goals. The sister's reaction might stem from hurt and feeling rejected, which is understandable but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they can still have children later, so their refusal isn't preventing the sister from having a child entirely; she can explore other options like sperm donation. The author isn't denying her the right to have a child but is prioritizing their own wishes.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the author is close to their sister, and the refusal caused emotional pain. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author isn't violating any obligation and is acting on personal choice, they aren't in the wrong. The sister's feelings are valid, but the author's decision is their own right.\n"
