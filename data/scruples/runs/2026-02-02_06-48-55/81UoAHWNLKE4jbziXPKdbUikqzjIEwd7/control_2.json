Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their lesbian sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm so that both she and her wife can be genetically related to the child. The author feels uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves, not just an uncle. They're worried about missing out on fatherhood, given the challenges with adoption and surrogacy in their country.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of being jealous or having internalized homophobia. The author is conflicted between their desire to help their sister and their own aspirations of being a parent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the sister is seeking help to have a family, which is a big deal. The author is a sibling who's close to her, and saying no might feel like a rejection. On the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons. They want to be a parent, and donating sperm now might limit their future options. Also, the emotional aspect of wanting to be fully involved in a child's life is a personal choice that's hard to dismiss.\n\nLegally, sperm donation is a personal decision, and people have the right to choose not to donate. The author isn't obligated to help, even if it's a family member. The sister's frustration is understandable, but the author isn't morally wrong for prioritizing their own future. \n\nHowever, the author might be seen as selfish because they are close to the sister and she's in a position where she needs support. But considering the author's reasons are genuine and the fact that they do want their sister to have kids (just not through this method), it's more about personal choice rather than being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own future and feelings about parenthood. The sister's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to donate. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points, but the decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
