After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend found out later. He was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child.\n\nSo, the key points here: she told her family first, waited a few days to think things over, then told her boyfriend. He feels excluded from the decision-making process. She argues that it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. In a committed relationship, especially when a pregnancy is involved, both partners usually have a say in decisions. The boyfriend might feel that the decision to keep the child is a shared responsibility, so not including him in the initial decision-making could be seen as a mistake.\n\nBut on the other hand, she did eventually tell him and they have decided to keep the child. She might have felt the need to process the news with her family first, especially since they are mothers and can provide support. However, the timing and not consulting him first could lead to feelings of being left out.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. Some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should be informed and involved in such a major life decision. Others might say it's her body and her decision, so she has the right to consult her family first.\n\nBut considering that the boyfriend was her partner, and the child is theirs, not just hers, it's possible that she should have discussed it with him before making the decision. Even if she was unsure, involving him from the start could have been better, even if she still needed her family's support.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't include her partner in the initial decision-making, which is crucial for mutual trust and partnership. But others might say B because it's her choice. However, given the context of the relationship, the correct answer leaning towards A makes sense.\n"
