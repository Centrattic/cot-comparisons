After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that the author found out she's pregnant, took two days to think, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have decided together. The author thinks it's her choice since it's her body, but he's upset he wasn't included first.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about communication and partnership. The author made a decision that affects both of them, but did it without her partner initially. The boyfriend feels excluded, which is valid because major life decisions like this usually require mutual agreement. Even though the author had her reasons\u2014like seeking advice from her family\u2014who are mothers, it's important that both partners are involved in such decisions. \n\nThe author's action might be seen as not respecting her boyfriend's role in the situation. While it's her body and she might have felt the need to process the news with her family, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a decision that impacts both their lives. The fact that the author waited a few days and discussed it with her family before telling him could have been handled differently. She could have mentioned the possibility to her boyfriend first, even if she then needed to talk to her family for support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that she needed time to process and her family's input was helpful. However, in a committed relationship, especially when considering having a child together, transparency and joint decision-making are crucial. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of partnership in such matters. So, even if her intentions were good, the action was taken without including her partner, which is a valid point of contention. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving her boyfriend in the decision-making process from the start.\n"
