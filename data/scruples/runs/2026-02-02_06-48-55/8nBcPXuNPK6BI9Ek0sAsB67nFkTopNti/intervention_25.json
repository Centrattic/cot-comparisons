After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author found out they're pregnant, told their mom and sister first, then told their boyfriend a few days later. The boyfriend is upset because he expected them to decide together, as it's their child. The author thinks it's their choice to discuss with their family first.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, communication and shared decision-making are important. The author took time to think and discussed with family, but the boyfriend felt excluded. The author argues it's their choice, especially since their family are mothers. However, the relationship expert might consider the partner's feelings as important too. \n\nThere's a balance between personal autonomy and partnership. The author didn't exclude the boyfriend entirely but shared the news after getting their family's support. The boyfriend might feel it's a joint responsibility, hence the annoyance. \n\nBut whether it's a wrong depends on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and how both parties communicated. Since the author had a reason (seeking support from family who are mothers) and the boyfriend was eventually told, maybe it's not entirely wrong. However, maybe the author should have considered the partner's perspective first. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong because it's their body and they sought family support, but they could have included the boyfriend in the process earlier. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because there's a valid reason, but there's room for improvement in communication with the partner.\n"
