After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. Her boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. She argues that it's her choice and that her family are mothers themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. In relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel excluded because he wasn't the first to know. He wanted to be part of the decision-making process. The author did tell her family first, which could be seen as prioritizing her family over her partner. However, she did consult with her family, and her boyfriend was okay after being told. \n\nThe main point of contention is whether involving family before the partner is wrong. In some relationships, the partner expects to be the first to know about such a major life event. It's about trust and shared decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt left out, even if the outcome was positive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been processing the news and seeking support from her family, which is natural. She did involve her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay with the decision to keep the baby. However, the fact that she delayed telling him and made the decision without him could be a point of conflict. \n\nCulturally, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some might say the partner should be the first to know, others might see family support as crucial. The key issue is the communication gap. The author could have included her boyfriend in the initial discussions with her family, but she didn't. That might be where she went wrong. \n\nSo, even though her intentions were understandable, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The wrong isn't about the decision to tell family first, but about not including the partner in the process. The answer might be that the author is partially in the wrong because she didn't involve her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, which is a shared responsibility in a committed relationship. But others might argue that it's her body and her choice, so she's not in the wrong. \n\nI need to weigh the two perspectives. The boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, while the author's action is about seeking support. The right answer might depend on the relationship's expectations. However, in many cases, partners expect to be involved in such major decisions. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consult her boyfriend first. But others might say B (not in the wrong) because it's her decision. \n\nBut the author says she discussed it with her family and then told her boyfriend, and he was okay with the decision to keep the baby. The main issue is the order of disclosure. If the boyfriend felt it was important to be the first, then the author might be in the wrong. The question is whether the order matters more than the content of the decision. The boyfriend's annoyance is about being left out of the process, not the decision itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't include her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, which is a significant partnership matter. Even though she had her family's support, the boyfriend's feelings about shared responsibility are valid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
