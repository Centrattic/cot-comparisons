After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. The situation is that the author found out they're pregnant, told their mom and sister first, then took a few days to think and discuss with family. They decided to keep the baby, then told their boyfriend, who was upset that they didn't include him in the initial decision and the delay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a woman, so the pregnancy is her body. They told their family first, probably seeking support since they are mothers themselves. The boyfriend's reaction is being annoyed because he feels it's their child and should have been involved from the start. \n\nThe key points are: the author made the decision independently before informing the boyfriend, which he feels was a mistake. The question is whether this makes the author at fault. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt the need to consult her family first, especially since they are mothers and could offer immediate, personal advice. It's common for people to share such news with close family first. Also, the decision to keep the pregnancy is significant and might have been influenced by her family's input. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is a part of the relationship, and major life decisions like this often require mutual discussion. The author waited a few days without consulting him, which could make him feel excluded. Even though it's her body, the relationship aspect implies teamwork, so not including him in the initial decision might be seen as not respecting his role in the relationship. \n\nI should also think about societal norms. While it's her choice to make, sharing the news with family before the partner might be considered a breach of the relationship's partnership, depending on the couple's dynamics. However, some might argue that involving family for immediate support is reasonable, especially if the partner wasn't present during the initial discovery. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a joint decision. The author's reasoning is that it's her choice and her family's support was necessary. The answer might depend on the expectations within the relationship. If the couple has always made decisions together, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the boyfriend wasn't around or the situation required immediate family support, it could be seen as understandable. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate based on the information given. The article mentions the author discussed with her family for a few days before telling the boyfriend, which he found annoying. The author justifies it by saying it's her choice and her family's experience. \n\nI think the correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because while it's her body, the relationship requires communication and joint decision-making. However, there's a gray area. The author might not be at fault if the boyfriend was unaware of the initial plan to discuss with family first. But the boyfriend's perspective is valid as a partner in the relationship. The decision to have a child is a mutual one, even if the initial decision is made by the pregnant person. The delay and not including him upfront could lead to feelings of exclusion. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here.\n"
