After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. So the situation is that she found out she was pregnant, took a few days to think, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. He was upset because they should have decided together, but she thinks it's her choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key issue is whether informing family before the partner is wrong. The boyfriend feels excluded from the decision-making process, which makes sense because it's their child. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed and needed support from her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves. \n\nOn one hand, in a committed relationship, major decisions like having a child should be mutual. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because it's a joint responsibility. But on the other hand, the author might have had good reasons to seek her family's input first. It's about communication and expectations. Did the couple have prior discussions about such matters? If they didn't, then both might have different expectations. \n\nThe author does mention she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it, so she took time to think. That shows she was trying to be careful. However, not including the partner in the initial decision-making could be seen as not respecting their role in the relationship. \n\nBut is it a case of being \"in the wrong\"? It's a bit subjective. The author's actions were out of seeking support, but the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend was upset about not being included, but the author had her reasons, maybe it's a grey area. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't wrong because it's her body and she needed to process the news. But others might say that in a partnership, such big decisions should be made together. The answer might be that it's not a clear right or wrong, but the author's actions could have been handled differently. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
