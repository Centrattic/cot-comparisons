After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: the author told her family first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's their child and they should have made the decision together. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel that discussing the pregnancy with her immediate family first is natural, especially since they are mothers and can offer support. They might provide emotional support and advice, which is important. Also, the author took time to think things over, which could be necessary for a big decision like this.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is about partnership. He might feel excluded from the decision-making process, which is crucial for both of them. The pregnancy affects both their lives, so not involving him immediately could lead to feelings of being left out or not trusted. The author decided to keep the baby before discussing with him, which might have been a significant decision without his input.\n\nBut then, the author did talk to her family first, which could be a common practice in some families. However, since this is a shared life decision with her boyfriend, the order of informing could matter. The boyfriend's reaction is about the decision-making process, not just who was told first. The fact that she waited a few days to decide without him is a point of contention. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe it's not a clear right or wrong. It's more about the relationship dynamics. If the couple had prior expectations about how such decisions should be made, then not following those could be an issue. But if there were no such agreements, the author's actions might be seen as her right to consult her family first. However, keeping her decision from her partner for a few days might have been a mistake, especially if it's a joint responsibility. \n\nThe author says she can see his point but doesn't feel she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is in the wrong, but I'm supposed to decide. Considering the boyfriend's valid concern about partnership, maybe the author should have included him in the decision-making process from the start. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). But some might argue B (Not in the wrong) based on family support. It's a bit of a grey area, but the main issue is the decision-making without him. So I think A makes sense here.\n"
