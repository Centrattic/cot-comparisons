After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The key points here are the timeline and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She says she didn't know how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Then, when she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she went to her family first and made decisions without him. He argued it's their child, so they should have decided together. The author thinks her family's input was valid since they are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend feels like he was left out of a major decision that affects both of them. His reaction is understandable because a pregnancy is a life-changing event, and sharing it with others before your partner might come off as not considering their feelings or involving them in the process. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had reasons: she was unsure how her boyfriend would react, and she sought advice from her family, especially since they are mothers. She did eventually tell him, and he was okay with the decision. But the issue is the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel that major decisions, especially about their future together, should be made jointly. The author's decision to involve her family first could be seen as prioritizing her own emotional support and advice, which is valid, but the timing and lack of immediate communication with her partner might have caused hurt feelings. \n\nHowever, there's no clear right or wrong here. The author might not be in the wrong if her intention was to seek support and make a decision, especially if her boyfriend's reaction wasn't overly negative. The key is whether both partners felt involved. Since the author did eventually include her boyfriend and they made the decision to keep the baby together, maybe the main issue is the initial delay in informing him. \n\nBut since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and considering that in a committed relationship, both partners should ideally be involved in such decisions, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. The author might have made a good decision for herself but didn't consider her partner's feelings in the process. So the answer could lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong), but it's nuanced. However, given the options, the most balanced answer might be A, since she did make the decision without him, which is a common point of contention in such situations.\n"
