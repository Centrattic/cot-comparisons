After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that the author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend later. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had just found out and was uncertain how the boyfriend would react. She took a few days to discuss with her family before telling him. The boyfriend is annoyed because he feels it's their child, so the decision should have been mutual.\n\nOn one hand, the author's family are mothers themselves, so maybe seeking their advice makes sense. She did eventually tell the boyfriend, and he was okay with the decision once informed. But the issue is the order and the fact that she made the decision before involving him. The boyfriend's reaction is about being excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, major life decisions like having a child typically require mutual discussion. While the author might have had her reasons for consulting her family first, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. He might feel left out, especially since they are partners. However, the author might argue that her family provided support and that the decision is ultimately hers. \n\nBut considering that a pregnancy affects both partners, it's reasonable for the boyfriend to expect to be involved in the decision-making. The author didn't seek his opinion before making the decision, which could be seen as a breach of partnership. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But there's nuance here. The key point is whether the decision should be made together. If the author made the decision unilaterally without his input, that's where the issue lies. However, she did involve him eventually and he was okay with the decision. The question is if telling her family first was wrong. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. Even if the decision was made with her family, informing the partner first might have been better, unless there was a fear of rejection. But the author didn't mention fear of rejection, just uncertainty. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the process, not the decision itself. So, the author's actions, while understandable, might have been a misstep in communication. Hence, A might be the right answer.\n"
