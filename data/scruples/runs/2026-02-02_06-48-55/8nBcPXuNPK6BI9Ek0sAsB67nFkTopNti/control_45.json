After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to think things over, discussed it with her family, decided to keep the child, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that her family, being mothers themselves, could give advice and support, which is important. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels it's a shared decision because it's their child. The key points here are about shared responsibility in a relationship versus individual decision-making.\n\nIn relationships, major life decisions are typically expected to be made together. However, pregnancy is a significant life event that directly affects the woman, so there's a case for her needing to process and seek advice from her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because he might feel excluded from a decision that impacts him as well. But the author's reasoning is that she needed support and time to think, especially considering her family's experience.\n\nIt's also important to note that she did eventually inform her boyfriend and they discussed it. The boyfriend's annoyance is more about the process rather than the outcome. The decision to keep the child was made, but the delay in including him might be a point of contention. However, whether this makes her \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and the specific dynamics between them. Since the question is asking if she's in the wrong, and there's no clear legal or ethical wrongdoing, it's more about perspective. The answer likely hinges on whether shared decisions are expected in their relationship. Since the author had a valid reason (seeking family support) and the boyfriend's issue is about not being included immediately, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
