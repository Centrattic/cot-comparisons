After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, and then told her mom and sister. She waited a few days to decide on keeping the baby, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was okay with the decision to keep it. However, he was annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him, thinking it should have been a joint decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a significant life decision (whether to keep the baby) and involved her family first, then informed her boyfriend after making the decision. The boyfriend feels left out and thinks it should be a mutual decision since it's their child. The author feels she had the right to consult her family, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. In relationships, especially serious ones where both partners are committed, major decisions like having a child are typically expected to be mutual. Even though the decision is ultimately hers (as she's the one carrying the child), the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the process. \n\nOn one hand, consulting family for support is understandable, especially when making such a big decision. The author might feel she needed time to process and get advice. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that since it's their child, his input and presence in the decision-making are important. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice, which is true legally, but emotionally, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The issue here is communication and partnership. Even if the decision is hers to make, not including him in the process could lead to feelings of betrayal or being undervalued. \n\nThe answer depends on the expectations in their relationship. If they've always made decisions together, then this might be a breach. However, if she felt she needed time alone to decide, maybe that's understandable. But in a committed relationship, transparency is key. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not involving her boyfriend from the start, even if she ultimately made the decision. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of partnership in such matters. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But there's nuance here. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the boyfriend's perspective is valid, I think the answer is A.\n"
