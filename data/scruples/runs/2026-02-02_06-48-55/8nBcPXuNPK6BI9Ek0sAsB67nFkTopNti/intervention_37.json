After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her family before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. He's upset because he thinks they should have decided together as it's their child.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that she wanted to process it first, and her family are mothers themselves. She kept discussing with them. The boyfriend feels left out and wants joint decision-making. \n\nSo, the key points are: communication, joint decision-making in a relationship, and the impact on the boyfriend. In relationships, big decisions like this are usually expected to be made together. Even if she needed time, not involving him immediately could be seen as a breach of partnership. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a decision that affects both of them. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have needed support and her family could provide that. But ideally, major life events should be shared with the partner first, especially when it's a joint responsibility. The boyfriend's point is valid because it's their child. However, the author might not have considered that her family's opinions could influence her decision, leading to a delay in informing him. \n\nSo, maybe the author made a mistake by not including her boyfriend from the start, even if she discussed with family. The right approach might have been to tell him first, then seek family input. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
