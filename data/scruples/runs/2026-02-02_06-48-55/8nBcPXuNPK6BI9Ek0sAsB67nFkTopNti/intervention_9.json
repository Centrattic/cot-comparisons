After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. He was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made the decision to tell her family first, consulted with them, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he thought they should have discussed it together. The author argues that it's her choice and that her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. In a committed relationship, especially when planning to have a child together, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable. However, the author had a reason to involve her family first\u2014perhaps for support and advice, especially since her family members are mothers.\n\nBut is that a valid reason? The boyfriend might feel that major life decisions like having a child should be mutual. The author's decision to involve her family first could be seen as prioritizing her own support network over including her partner in the initial steps. However, the author might also feel that involving her family was necessary for her own emotional processing and decision-making.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a relationship perspective, transparency and mutual decision-making are important. The author didn't act out of malice but perhaps out of personal need to process with her family. However, not informing her boyfriend first could be seen as a breach of partnership. On the other hand, if the boyfriend was already aware of the possibility and the author needed time to process, maybe it's more about differing expectations.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the relationship's communication norms. If both partners expected to discuss such matters together, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author had a legitimate need to seek family support first and the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, it's a matter of perspective. However, in a committed relationship, making such a significant decision without the partner could be problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including her boyfriend from the start, even if she involved her family.\n"
