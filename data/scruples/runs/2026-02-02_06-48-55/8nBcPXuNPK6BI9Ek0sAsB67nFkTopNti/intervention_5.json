After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her family about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together. The author says she wanted to process it with her family first, and now she's keeping the baby.\n\nSo, from the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel left out of a major decision that affects both of them. It's important to consider communication in a relationship. When big life decisions are made, partners usually expect to discuss them together. Even if the author needed time to think, not involving her partner early on could lead to feelings of being excluded.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt the need to talk to her family first, especially since they are mothers and could offer support. She might have been emotionally overwhelmed and needed their input before discussing with her boyfriend. That makes sense, but it's also about mutual respect in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's part of the future child's life too.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's a bit situational. There's no clear right or wrong here. However, since the decision affects both partners, ideally they should have been included from the start. The key point is that the author didn't consult her boyfriend first, which is a common expectation in relationships for such matters. So, while her actions are understandable, the boyfriend's feelings are valid, and she might have handled it differently to include him earlier. Therefore, she could be seen as in the wrong for not involving her partner first.\n"
