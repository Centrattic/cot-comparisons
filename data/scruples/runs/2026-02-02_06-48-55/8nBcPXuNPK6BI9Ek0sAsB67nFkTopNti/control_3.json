After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author found out they're pregnant, told their mom and sister first, then discussed with family for a few days before telling the boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together, as it's their child. The author thinks they're not wrong because they talked to their family, who are also mothers.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication in a relationship and shared decision-making. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the boyfriend felt excluded. Even if the author considered their family's input, the partner's reaction is valid because major life decisions, like having a child, typically involve both partners.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If they had prior discussions about such matters, maybe the author acted out of line. However, the author might not have been sure how the boyfriend would react, which is understandable. Still, deciding without involving the partner could be seen as not respecting their role in the decision, even if the author's own family was involved.\n\nThe boyfriend's point is that it's their child, implying joint responsibility. So while the author's actions might be justifiable from their perspective, the boyfriend's feelings of being left out are valid. The answer might hinge on whether the author communicated their plan to involve family before making the decision. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with the boyfriend first, there's a case that they should have included him in the decision process from the start.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they made a significant decision without involving their partner, even if the partner's reaction was calm. The decision affects both of them, so ideally, they should have discussed it together. The fact that the author waited a few days to think things over might not be sufficient if they didn't involve the boyfriend in that process.\n"
