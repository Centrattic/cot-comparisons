After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, and he was annoyed because she told her family first and made the decision without including him. The author says she can see his point but feels it's her choice and doesn't think she's wrong because her family are mothers and can help. \n\nHmm. The question is whether she's at fault. Let's break it down. First, the boyfriend's reaction is annoyance because he feels left out of the decision-making. He considers the child to be theirs, not just hers, so he might expect to be involved in the big decisions. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her choice and turned to her family first for support. \n\nI think the key points here are communication and shared responsibility. In a relationship, especially when considering a major life event like a pregnancy, partners usually expect to be involved in the discussions. The author waited a few days and discussed it with her family before informing her boyfriend. Even if her family has experience, the boyfriend might feel that his input was necessary. \n\nBut then, is the author really in the wrong? She did tell her family first, which can be seen as seeking support, but she did eventually tell her boyfriend. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the timing and not being included in the decision-making process. The author might have thought her family could provide immediate support, but the boyfriend's perspective is that they should have made the decision together. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the author was in a committed relationship, the expectation might be that both partners are in the decision together. However, she did reach out to her family first because they are mothers and could offer guidance. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is a valid feeling. But does that mean she was wrong? \n\nI think it's possible that the author made a good decision based on her own reasoning and support system, but she could have considered her boyfriend's feelings more. Maybe she should have told him as soon as she had the information, even if she wasn't sure yet. However, she did tell him eventually and they made the decision to keep the child together. \n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is the sequence of communication. He might feel that the decision is mutual and thus should be discussed with him first. But the author's reasoning is that she needed support and perspective from her family. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I'm leaning towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the decision to have a child is a shared responsibility in a committed relationship. Even if she wasn't sure at first, she could have discussed it with her boyfriend as she was considering it. However, the opposite argument is that she had her reasons and eventually shared the news. The answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. \n\nBut since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, and the boyfriend's reaction is about being left out, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. The author's intent was to get support and make a decision, but the timing and order of communication might have been a mistake. So, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
