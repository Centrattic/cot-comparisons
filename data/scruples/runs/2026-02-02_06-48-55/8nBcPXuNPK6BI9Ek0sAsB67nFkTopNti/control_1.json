After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed with her family over a few days before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The main point here is about communication and decision-making in a partnership. The author mentions that she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take the news and took time to process it with her family. She decided to keep the baby. Then when she told her boyfriend, he was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together. \n\nThe author argues that it's her choice, especially since her family are mothers themselves. But the boyfriend's perspective is that it's their child, so the decision should be mutual. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the expectations in their relationship. If they had prior agreements about such matters, not including him might be an issue. However, if there was no such agreement, her action might be seen as her right to make the decision. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, major decisions like having a child usually require mutual discussion. By not informing her boyfriend first, even if she was uncertain, she might have overlooked his role as a partner. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels left out of a crucial decision. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that she needed time to process and that her family could provide support. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether informing family before the partner is wrong. In many cases, people might prioritize telling their partner first, but there's no universal rule. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. If the author didn't communicate her intentions beforehand, that could be a problem. But if she was in a state of uncertainty and sought family support, maybe her actions are understandable. \n\nThe answer hinges on relationship norms. If the boyfriend expected to be involved in the decision-making process, then the author might be in the wrong for not including him. However, if she had her reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is about differing expectations, it's more about how they handle the situation moving forward rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might be understandable given her uncertainty, the boyfriend's perspective is valid as well. The situation is complex, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the decision to have a child affects both partners, not discussing it with him first could be seen as a misstep. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
