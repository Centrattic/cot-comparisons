After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before telling her boyfriend, and then when she did tell him, he was annoyed because he thought they should have made the decision together. She's saying that she didn't feel wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, and her family can offer support. She might have felt uncertain and needed time to think with her family. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable because it's their child. The question is whether she made a mistake by not involving him first.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. A big life decision like pregnancy definitely involves both partners. By waiting a few days and consulting her family before telling her boyfriend, she might have overlooked his right to be part of that decision. Even if she was uncertain, involving her partner could have been a better approach. However, it's also true that she might have felt the need to process the news with her own family first, especially since they are mothers and can provide maternal perspective.\n\nBut then again, relationships require mutual decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because this is a shared responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but she could have handled it better by including her partner from the start. It's a balance between personal autonomy and partnership. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't include her partner in the initial decision-making, which is important in a relationship. Even if her intentions were good, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. But some might argue B (No) because it's her body and her choice. However, in a committed relationship, it's usually expected to make such decisions together. So leaning towards A.\n"
