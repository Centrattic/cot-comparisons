After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed it with her boyfriend later. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author kept the baby, and her family are mothers themselves, so she might have felt comfortable discussing it with them.\n\nNow, the key points here are the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. The boyfriend's main issue is that he wasn't involved upfront. He might see this as a joint decision, so being excluded from the initial discussions could hurt him. On the other hand, the author might feel that consulting her family was necessary, especially since they have experience as mothers.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, big decisions like this are supposed to be made together. However, the author might have felt uncertain and needed support from her family first. The timing is important\u2014she told the boyfriend eventually, but after her family. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he wanted to be part of the process from the start.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It depends on the relationship's expectations. If there was an unspoken agreement to discuss such matters together, then she might have breached that. However, if the boyfriend didn't communicate his expectations clearly before the decision was made, that's also a factor. The author might not be in the wrong if she acted in good faith but the situation highlights a need for better communication moving forward.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the action was reasonable. The author's reasoning\u2014seeking family support and eventually informing her boyfriend\u2014could be seen as reasonable. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The answer might be a nuanced 'No' because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for discussion about partnership in decisions.\n"
