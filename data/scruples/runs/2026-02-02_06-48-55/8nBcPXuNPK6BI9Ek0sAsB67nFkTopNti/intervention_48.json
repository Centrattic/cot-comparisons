After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to think things over, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made decisions together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the boyfriend has a point. When a couple has a child together, major decisions like this usually require mutual discussion. The author did make the decision to keep the baby without telling him first, which might make him feel left out. But on the other hand, she did involve her family, who are mothers, which might have been a source of support for her. Also, she did eventually tell her boyfriend, and he was okay with it, just annoyed about the order.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether informing her family first was wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the decision-making process. The author's reasoning is that it's her choice and her family's support is important. However, since it's a joint decision affecting both partners, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. The author might have handled it better by discussing it with her boyfriend first, even if she needed family support. But she didn't do that. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she didn't include her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, even though her intentions were to seek support from her family. The boyfriend's reaction is about joint responsibility, which is a legitimate concern.\n"
