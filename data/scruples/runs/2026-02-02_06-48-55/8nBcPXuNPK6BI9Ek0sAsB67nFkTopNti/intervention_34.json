After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out she was pregnant and told her mom and sister right after the second positive test. She then took a few days to think it over and discuss with her family. She decided to keep the baby and later told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because she told her family first and made decisions without him. He felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, in a relationship, major life decisions like having a child are usually expected to be mutual. The boyfriend might feel excluded and that his partner didn't consider his feelings. The author's actions might have been impulsive from his perspective, even if she had good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt the need to talk to her family first, especially since they are mothers and could offer support. She might have been processing the news and seeking advice before involving her partner. It's also possible that she was anxious and needed to share the news with her family first.\n\nBut the key issue here is communication and mutual decision-making. Even if the author had valid reasons for telling her family first, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of an important decision. The fact that she decided to keep the baby without his input might be the bigger issue. While it's her choice ultimately, in a committed relationship, partners often expect to be involved in such decisions together. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong for seeking support from her family, the decision to not involve her boyfriend in the initial stages and the decision-making process could be seen as a mistake. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the lack of collaboration. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not including her partner from the start, even if the family's input was helpful.\n"
