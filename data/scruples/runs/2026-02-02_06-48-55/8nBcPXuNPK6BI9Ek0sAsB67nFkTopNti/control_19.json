After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She took a few days to think it over and discuss with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. She told her boyfriend later, and he was upset because he thought they should have made the decision together. The author feels she isn't in the wrong because she had support from her family and it's her choice.\n\nThe key points here are about communication in a relationship and shared decision-making. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision, which is a valid concern because a pregnancy does affect both partners. But the author might feel that discussing it with her family first was necessary for her emotional support and that it's her body, so her choice is important too.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for both partners to want to be involved in major decisions. However, the author might have her reasons for reaching out to her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be part of the process, but the author's action could be seen as her needing support from her own family. \n\nIt's possible that both have valid points. The author isn't wrong for seeking support from her family, especially since they are mothers and might offer practical advice. But the boyfriend might feel that a joint decision was necessary. However, the author did eventually inform her boyfriend and included him in the next step of telling their families. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit subjective. The question is whether she should have waited to tell her family until after telling her boyfriend. Since she did inform him eventually and he had input after the fact, maybe she isn't entirely in the wrong. The main issue is about the order of communication. Some might argue that the boyfriend should have been told first, but others would agree that seeking family support is okay. \n\nGiven that the author made the decision to keep the baby after discussing with her family and then informed her boyfriend, it's a shared outcome. The boyfriend's annoyance is valid, but the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong, especially if she had her reasons. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's a cultural or relational norm that emphasizes joint decision-making here. However, since the author's decision was communicated to the boyfriend and he was involved after the fact, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
