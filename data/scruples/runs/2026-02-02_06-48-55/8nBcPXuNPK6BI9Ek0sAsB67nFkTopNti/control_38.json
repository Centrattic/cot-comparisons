After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and called her mom and sister first. She was uncertain about how her boyfriend would react, so she took time to think and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: Did she wrong the boyfriend by not telling him first? Is the decision-making process shared? The boyfriend feels left out. But the author had her reasons\u2014uncertainty about his reaction and seeking support from her family. \n\nOn one hand, in a relationship, major life decisions like having a child are typically considered joint decisions. So not involving the boyfriend immediately might be seen as not respecting his role in the decision. But on the other hand, the author felt the need to process the news and seek support from her family first, which is understandable. Also, she did make the decision to keep the child, which she shared with her boyfriend after, and he was okay with it. \n\nThe boyfriend being annoyed is about the process, not the outcome. The author's actions were out of her own considerations, but the boyfriend might feel that the decision should have been made together. However, the decision was made in the end, and the boyfriend was informed and accepted it. \n\nSo whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the issue is about communication and joint decision-making, then maybe she should have discussed it earlier. But if it's about the time she took to process and the support she needed from family, then she's not wrong. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she did inform her boyfriend eventually, and her reasoning is valid. However, there's a valid point from the boyfriend's side about shared decisions. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since the author's actions were based on her need and she did involve the boyfriend afterward, maybe B is the answer.\n"
