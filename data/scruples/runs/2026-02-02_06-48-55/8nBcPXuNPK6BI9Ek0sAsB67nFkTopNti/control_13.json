After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then told her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she discussed it with her family for a few days before telling him. The boyfriend was upset that she told her family first and made decisions without him. She argues that it's her choice and that her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication in a relationship, shared decision-making, and the expectations of both partners. \n\nIn relationships, partners usually expect to be the first to know about significant life events, especially regarding their future together like pregnancy. The author's boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because it's their child. However, the author had her own reasons for involving her family first, possibly for emotional support and guidance, given that her mom and sister are mothers.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting one's own family and including the partner in major decisions. While the author might not feel she's in the wrong, the boyfriend's perspective is about partnership. The answer might depend on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and how each person views shared responsibility.\n\nI need to consider if there's a general consensus here. Some might say she should have included her boyfriend from the start because it affects him too. Others might say her choice to consult her family is her right. The boyfriend's reaction is about being part of the decision, which is reasonable. So, there's a valid point on both sides.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend is part of the decision-making process, then not including him could be seen as a mistake. However, if her actions were out of fear of his reaction and seeking support, it's a bit more nuanced. It's possible she's not in the wrong but could have handled it differently. However, the boyfriend's feelings are important, so maybe there's some fault in not considering his perspective earlier.\n"
