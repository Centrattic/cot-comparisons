After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he wanted to make the decision together as it's their child.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the relationship dynamics. The author is in a committed relationship, presumably with her boyfriend. The main issue here is who should have been informed first and whether the decision to keep the child was made jointly. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is a valid concern in a partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt the need to discuss it with her family first, especially since they are mothers and could provide support. She may have been emotionally overwhelmed and needed to confide in her close family members. She did eventually tell her boyfriend, and he was okay with the pregnancy, just upset about the timing and lack of joint decision-making.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and how both parties communicate. In many relationships, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be made together. However, the author might not have known how her boyfriend would react and needed time to process. \n\nBut even so, the boyfriend's reaction points out that the decision should have been mutual. While it's her body and her choice, the partner's input is important in a partnership. Not involving him in the initial decision-making could be seen as neglecting his feelings and the shared responsibility. \n\nHowever, the author didn't keep it a secret entirely; she told her family first. It's about priorities and communication. The boyfriend's annoyance is about not being included in the decision-making process, which is a relationship aspect. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a middle ground here. The author might not be entirely wrong because she had her reasons, but from the boyfriend's perspective, it's a valid grievance. The key is open communication and mutual respect. Since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer might be a bit nuanced, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nGiven that the author did inform her boyfriend eventually and he's okay with the pregnancy, but the issue is about the process, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should be involved in such decisions. The fact that she made the decision to keep the child without discussing it with him might be seen as a mistake, even if she later explained her reasoning. So perhaps the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong for not involving him in the decision-making process. However, others might argue B, considering her actions were based on seeking family support. But the boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of partnership in such matters. I think the answer is A because the decision should have been mutual.\n"
