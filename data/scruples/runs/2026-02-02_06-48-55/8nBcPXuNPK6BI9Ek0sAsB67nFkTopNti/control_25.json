After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mom and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together. The author defends her decision by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, so they could give advice.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Relationships often require communication and mutual decision-making. The boyfriend's argument is that it's their child, so he should have been involved in the decision. The author felt her family's input was necessary, but maybe she should have considered her partner's feelings as well.\n\nIs it her fault? Well, she made a choice based on her own needs and her family's support. However, not involving the partner in the decision might have been a misstep. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's a co-parent. But the author might have her reasons for seeking her family's advice first.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the decision should have been a joint one. If the author thinks it's her choice, but the boyfriend feels excluded, there's a conflict in expectations. The question is whether her action was wrong. Since both perspectives can be valid, but the boyfriend's reaction is about being left out, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. But some might argue she should have communicated better with him first. However, given that she did tell him eventually and they are deciding together now, perhaps it's not her fault entirely. So leaning towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
