After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the person found out they were pregnant, told their mom and sister first, spent a few days thinking things over with family, then told the boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author did involve their family, who are mothers themselves, which could be valid for support and advice. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel left out of the decision, especially since it's their child. The author's reasoning is that it's their choice, but relationships often require mutual decision-making.\n\nBut wait, is it a shared responsibility from the start? Even though the author made the decision initially, once they've decided to keep the child, it's a joint responsibility. So maybe the author should have included the boyfriend earlier, even if they were uncertain. However, the author did eventually involve the boyfriend, and he was okay about it, just annoyed about the order. \n\nThe key point here is communication and mutual respect. The author might have thought consulting family was necessary, but the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt excluded. The question is whether the author had the right to decide first or if the decision should have been made together from the start. I think it's a gray area, but in a relationship, major decisions affecting both partners should be discussed together. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not including the boyfriend immediately, even if they were unsure. So the answer would be A.\n"
