After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about telling family before the boyfriend about a pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, waited a few days to think it over, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he thought they should have discussed it together. She argues it's her choice since it's her body and her family are mothers too.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think this depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, big decisions are made jointly. However, the author might feel the need to seek advice from her own family first, especially since they're experienced mothers. The boyfriend might feel left out, but the author's actions were to process the news and seek support from her family before involving her partner.\n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. The author might not be in the wrong because it's her decision, but there's also a valid point that the boyfriend should be part of the conversation. However, since she did tell him eventually and he's okay with it, maybe the issue is more about communication timing rather than the decision itself. \n\nSo, considering that the author made a personal choice and involved her family for support, I'd lean towards B (not in the wrong). The key is that she informed her boyfriend later and they can discuss it moving forward. The boyfriend's annoyance is understandable but doesn't necessarily make her wrong. It's a matter of differing expectations in the relationship.\n"
