After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author found out she was pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She waited a few days to discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. When she did tell him, he was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could give her advice.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did she wrong her boyfriend by not telling him first? 2) Is the decision about the pregnancy solely hers or should it be mutual?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency and communication are important. Even though the decision is hers medically, major life decisions like this typically involve both partners. By involving her family first and delaying the conversation with her boyfriend, she might have caused him to feel excluded. However, she mentions discussing with her family because they are experienced mothers, which can be a valid reason for seeking their advice.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a decision that affects both of them. It's reasonable for him to feel that way. The author's argument that it's her choice is valid in terms of bodily autonomy, but relationships often require shared decision-making, especially regarding children.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author considered her boyfriend's perspective. While she had a reason to involve her family first, not telling her boyfriend immediately could be seen as a misstep. So, she might be in the wrong for not consulting him first, even if her intentions were good. But there's nuance here. The decision to keep the baby is her decision biologically, but the relationship aspect requires mutual discussion. \n\nSo, maybe she's partially at fault, but not entirely. However, according to the options, the answer is either A or B. The question is whether she's in the wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes) because she prioritized her family and delayed informing her partner, which can be seen as not respecting his role in the decision-making process. However, there's also a counterpoint that she had valid reasons. But given the boyfriend's reaction and the importance of shared decisions in a relationship, the answer is A.\n"
