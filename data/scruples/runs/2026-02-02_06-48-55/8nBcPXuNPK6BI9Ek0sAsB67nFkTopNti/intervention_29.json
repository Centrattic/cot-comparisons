He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me try to break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant. She did two tests, both positive. Then she called her mom first, then her sister. She says she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Later, she told her boyfriend, who was \"pretty great\" but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. He felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nThe author argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could help her decide. The person asking the question (AITA) is the author, and they want to know if they're in the wrong. The user who posted the question thinks the author is in the wrong and is asking for others' opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author told her family first, waited a few days, and made the decision to keep the child before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend felt excluded from the decision-making process. The author believes she had the right to decide and consult her family.\n\nNow, considering relationships and communication, it's generally expected that major life decisions, especially involving a partner, should be discussed together. Even if the decision is ultimately the author's (like in the case of an abortion, but here she decided to keep the child), involving the partner in the process can affect the relationship dynamics. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out and not being part of the decision-making, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the author might have her reasons: maybe she was unsure how the boyfriend would react, so she turned to her family first for support. It could also be a matter of cultural or family norms where close family is informed first. \n\nBut in a committed relationship, especially when considering having a child together, the partner's input is typically considered crucial. The fact that the author waited a few days and made the decision without discussing it with her boyfriend could lead to feelings of betrayal or exclusion, even if her intentions were good. \n\nSo, while the author might not be \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, in a relationship context, not involving the partner in such a significant decision could be seen as a misstep. The boyfriend's reaction is about the process rather than the outcome. The question is whether the author was wrong to not include her partner in the decision-making process. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's expectations. If both parties had agreed beforehand on how to handle such a situation, it would be different. But since there's no mention of prior discussion, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The author might have acted out of need for support, but the decision to keep the child is a joint one once the partner is involved. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including her boyfriend in the decision-making process, even if she consulted her family. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted because it's a personal choice. However, in a relationship, important decisions usually require mutual discussion.\n"
