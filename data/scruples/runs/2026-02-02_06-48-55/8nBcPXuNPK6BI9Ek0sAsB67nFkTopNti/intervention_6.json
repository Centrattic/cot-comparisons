After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and called her mom and sister right away. She didn't tell her boyfriend immediately because she was unsure how he'd react and wanted to think things over with her family. Then, she decided to keep the child. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed that she told her family first and waited a few days without involving him. He felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author sees his point but doesn't feel wrong, thinking it's her choice and that her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author told her family first, waited a few days, made a decision without him, and then only told him after. The boyfriend is upset because he feels he should have been part of the discussion since it's their child. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and her family's support is important.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, when a couple is in a long-term relationship, major life decisions like having a child are typically expected to be discussed together. The boyfriend might feel left out or not trusted enough to be part of the initial decision-making process. On the other hand, the author might have her reasons\u2014maybe she felt unsure about his reaction, or she needed her family's support first. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's no clear right or wrong, but expectations in relationships often involve communication and shared decision-making. If the couple considers themselves partners, then involving each other in such significant decisions is important. The author's decision to wait could be seen as prioritizing her family's input over her partner's, which might be viewed as a mistake. However, she also had a valid reason to seek family support, especially if they're experienced mothers.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of perspective. If the boyfriend expected to be involved from the start, then the author's action might be seen as not respecting his input. But if the author felt she needed time and support, maybe she's justified. However, in a committed relationship, partners usually expect to be informed immediately and involved in decisions. Delaying the conversation with the partner could be seen as not honoring the partnership aspect. So, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because she didn't inform her boyfriend right away, which is a significant decision affecting both of them. Even if she had her reasons, the expectation in most relationships is to communicate major news to each other before others. Her family is important, but the partner is equally a key stakeholder in this decision.\n"
