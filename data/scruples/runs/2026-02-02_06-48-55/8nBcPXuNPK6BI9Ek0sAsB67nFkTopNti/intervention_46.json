After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because she wanted to discuss with her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the key points: the woman found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. He's upset because he wanted to be involved in the decision-making process together. She had a few days to think and discuss with her family before telling him. He's annoyed about being left out initially.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship. When a couple is in a committed relationship and expecting a child, major decisions like whether to continue the pregnancy are typically considered joint decisions. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels excluded from a major life decision that affects both of them. Even if the woman felt the need to discuss with her family first, not including her partner in the initial decision-making could be seen as disregarding his feelings and the partnership aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might feel that her family, being mothers themselves, could provide support and guidance, which is important. However, the timing and the fact that she waited a few days to involve her boyfriend might have contributed to his hurt feelings. The boyfriend might feel that his role as a partner was overlooked, especially since it's their child together. \n\nIn many relationships, open communication and involving each other in significant decisions is crucial. While it's okay to seek support from family, doing so before the partner could be perceived as not valuing the partner's input. The woman might not be in the wrong from a personal standpoint, but from a relational perspective, not including the boyfriend in the initial discussions could be seen as a mistake.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the boyfriend's feelings are valid, and the woman's actions might have caused unnecessary hurt. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including her boyfriend in the decision-making process from the start, even if her intent was to seek family support.\n"
