After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She waited a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have decided together since the child is theirs.\n\nSo, the main point here is the order of telling. The boyfriend feels left out and believes it's their shared decision. The author thinks it's her choice because it's her body and her family are also mothers who can provide support.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's argument is about shared responsibility, as the child is theirs. On the other hand, the author might feel that involving her family first was necessary for emotional support and decision-making, especially since they're experienced as mothers.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm regarding this? In some cultures, family involvement is key. Also, the author might have felt uncertain about her boyfriend's reaction, so talking to her family first could be a way to seek reassurance before discussing it with him.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is valid too. A pregnancy affects both partners, and decisions about the future, like careers, living arrangements, etc., would involve both. Delaying discussion with him could lead to feelings of exclusion or mistrust.\n\nHowever, the author didn't keep the pregnancy a secret from the boyfriend forever. She did inform him eventually and he was supportive. The issue is about the order and the decision-making process. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to tell her family first. Since the decision to keep the baby is hers and hers alone in terms of legal and medical authority, she might not be in the wrong. However, from a relationship standpoint, involving the partner early might be expected for shared decisions.\n\nBut the author had a valid reason: she wasn't sure how he would react and needed time to think. Her family's support was crucial during that time. The boyfriend's annoyance is about feeling excluded, but the author's actions were done with good intentions to seek support.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the decision is hers alone or a shared one. Since the article asks for AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community would weigh both sides. In this case, the author might not be the asshole because she had her reasons and eventually included her boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She made a choice that prioritized her emotional needs and family support, and while the boyfriend's feelings are valid, her actions don't make her the asshole here.\n"
