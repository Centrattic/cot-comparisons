After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took a few days to process, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author thinks her family's input was important, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the main points here are about communication in a relationship versus family support. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable. When two people are in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child typically involve both partners. The author made the decision to tell her family first and waited a few days to tell her boyfriend, which he found frustrating.\n\nBut the author also mentions that she took time to think and discussed it with her family, and eventually told her boyfriend, who was supportive. However, the key issue is the timing and the process of decision-making. By telling her family first and not including her boyfriend in the initial decision, she might have overlooked his role as a partner. \n\nOn the other hand, seeking advice from family, especially mothers, is common and can be comforting. But in a relationship, transparency and shared decision-making are crucial. The boyfriend's reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh, is valid because he feels it's their child and he should have been involved from the start.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had good intentions, but maybe she should have communicated better with her boyfriend first. However, consulting family isn't inherently wrong. The main issue is not including her partner in the process. Since the decision affects both of them, involving him earlier would have been better. \n\nGiven that, the author might have been in the wrong by not including her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, even if she had valid reasons for involving her family. The boyfriend's perspective is that it's a joint responsibility, so the answer might lean towards yes (A). However, others might argue that seeking family support is okay. But considering the context of a relationship, the answer is probably A.\n"
