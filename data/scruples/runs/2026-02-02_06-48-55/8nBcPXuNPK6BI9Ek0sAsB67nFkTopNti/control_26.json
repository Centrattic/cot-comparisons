After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to think things over, discussed it with her family, decided to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together first, as it's their child. The author thinks it's her choice and doesn't feel wrong for involving her family first, who are both mothers.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sequence of communication and the boyfriend's reaction. The author's reasoning is that she needed time to process and that her family, being mothers themselves, could provide support. The boyfriend's concern is about shared decision-making since it's their child.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, major life decisions like having a child are considered joint responsibilities. The boyfriend might feel excluded by not being informed first. However, the author might feel that seeking family support is natural, especially since her sisters are also mothers and can offer practical advice.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. Some might argue that the boyfriend's feelings are valid because it's a shared future, so he should be involved from the start. Others might empathize with the author needing family support first. The author's decision to involve her family might be seen as seeking support, which is common. However, the boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of communication and mutual decision-making in a partnership.\n\nThe author's action isn't necessarily wrong, but it could be seen as a misstep in not including her partner immediately. However, cultural and personal factors play a role. If the couple had prior discussions about such scenarios, that would matter. Since there's no mention of prior expectations, it's hard to say definitively. The key is whether the author acted with good intentions (seeking support) versus keeping information from her partner. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the lack of joint decision-making, but the author's choice was to involve her family first.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The answer would depend on the relationship's norms. Since the author didn't act maliciously and had valid reasons (seeking support), many might side with her not being in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The answer is likely B (No), as it's a personal choice influenced by seeking family support, and the author didn't act with intent to exclude her partner but rather to process the news with her own family first.\n"
