After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was okay with the decision but upset that she didn't tell him first and involved her family without him. He felt it should have been a joint decision since it's their child.\n\nThe author defends her actions by saying it was her choice and that her family is supportive, being mothers themselves. The question is whether she was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. In a relationship, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a major decision. Even though the woman had her reasons, the boyfriend might feel that since it's their child, he should have been part of the initial decision-making process. However, the woman might argue that as the one carrying the pregnancy, the decision is hers to make, and consulting her family was natural.\n\nCultural and personal factors also play a role. Some people prioritize family input, others prioritize partner communication. The boyfriend's reaction is valid in that he wants to be included in major life decisions. But the woman's actions aren't necessarily wrong if she believes it's her right to make the decision and discuss it with her family first.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a nuanced situation. The key is whether the woman's actions were disrespectful or dismissive of her boyfriend's perspective. She did eventually tell him and they made the decision together. But she told her family first without his input. Depending on the relationship's expectations, this could be seen as a misstep. However, the woman doesn't feel wrong, which is important.\n\nIn many cases, people might say the woman is in the right because it's her body and choice. Others might say the boyfriend has a point in wanting to be included. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on common perspectives.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that while the decision is the woman's, involving the partner early is important. The woman didn't do that, which could be seen as a mistake. However, her intent wasn't malicious; she was taking time to process. So, maybe she's not in the wrong, but it's a minor issue. Alternatively, if the relationship expects joint decisions, then she might be in the wrong for not including him first.\n\nGiven that the woman did involve her family and the boyfriend was informed eventually, and the decision was made to keep the child, it's possible that she isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But if the key point is that the boyfriend wasn't included in the initial decision-making, it's a yes. But given the options, the answer could go either way. However, considering the emphasis on the woman's right to make the decision and consult her own family, maybe the answer is B.\n"
