After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about their pregnancy before their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author found out they're pregnant and initially reached out to family, then took a few days to decide to keep the child. Then they told the boyfriend, who was upset because he felt the decision should have been mutual.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the process, which is a valid concern. When a couple is in a committed relationship, major life decisions like pregnancy typically involve both partners. The author's reasoning is that it's their choice and that discussing with family, who are mothers themselves, was appropriate. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt it was a joint matter.\n\nBut then again, the author might have felt the need to process the news with their own family first, especially since it's a big decision. They mentioned taking time to think it over, which shows they weren't impulsive. However, the delay in informing the boyfriend and making the decision without him could be seen as not considering his role in the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a relational standpoint, transparency and involving the partner in such decisions is important. The author didn't exclude the boyfriend maliciously, but their approach might have overlooked his expectations. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because he sees the child as a product of both their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did eventually share the decision and the pregnancy, so there's no malicious intent. It might be more about differing expectations on communication timelines rather than a clear wrong. However, the fact that the author made a significant decision without including their partner could be seen as a breach in trust or partnership, even if well-intentioned. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not including the boyfriend in the decision-making process, even if it's their body. The balance between personal autonomy and partnership is tricky here, but relationships often require mutual decision-making on shared responsibilities.\n"
