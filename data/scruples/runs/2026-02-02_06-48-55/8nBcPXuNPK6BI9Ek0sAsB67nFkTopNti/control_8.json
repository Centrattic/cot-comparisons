After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed for a few days before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together, but she thinks she was right to involve her family first.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman told her family before her partner. The boyfriend is upset because it's their child, so he feels it should have been a joint decision. She argues that it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, communication and shared decision-making are important. However, the woman's actions might be seen as not including her partner in the initial decision-making process. But on the other hand, she did consult her family and eventually told her boyfriend, who was okay with the decision. She also considered her family's advice since they have experience as mothers.\n\nDifferent perspectives: The boyfriend's point is valid because it's their child, so he might want to be involved from the start. However, the woman's decision to seek support from her family isn't inherently wrong, especially if she felt uncertain. It's possible that she didn't want to burden him with the news immediately and needed time to process herself.\n\nCultural and personal norms might play a role. In some cultures, family is central in such decisions. The woman's reasoning is that her family could provide support, and she did involve her boyfriend later. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the initial decision.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit subjective. The woman might not be in the wrong if her intention was to seek support and she did involve her partner eventually. However, not including him in the initial decision could be seen as a misstep in communication. The key factor is whether the woman acted out of self-interest versus seeking support. Since she did discuss it with her family and then told her partner, maybe the main issue is the delay and not directly involving him first.\n\nBut the boyfriend's feelings are valid because he's a co-parent. The woman might benefit from discussing with him first in the future or at least including him in the initial discussions once she made a decision. However, her actions don't seem malicious. She didn't hide the pregnancy; she just sought family input first.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's perspective is important, the woman isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a choice based on her need for family support and eventually shared the decision with her partner. The answer might be B (No), but there's a balance here. It's more about communication styles rather than right or wrong.\n"
