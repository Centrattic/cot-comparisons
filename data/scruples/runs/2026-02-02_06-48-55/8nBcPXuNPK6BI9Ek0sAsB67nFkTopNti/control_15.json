After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. He's upset because he feels they should have decided together, but she thinks talking to her family was her choice.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication in a relationship. The author went to her family first, which the boyfriend took as not involving him in the decision-making process. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of an important decision that affects both of them. On the other hand, the author might feel that discussing it with her family was necessary, especially since they are mothers and could offer support.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's point is valid because a pregnancy is a shared responsibility, and he might feel that he should have been part of the initial decision-making. However, the author's actions might stem from seeking support from her family first, which is understandable. The question is whether her actions were wrong. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. Even if the author's intentions were good, not involving her partner immediately could be seen as a misstep. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of mutual decision-making in significant life events. However, the author might not feel wrong because she later shared the decision with her boyfriend and they are now both on board with keeping the baby. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for both sides. The answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. But generally, in a committed relationship, involving the partner in such decisions is important. The author's decision to tell her family first could be seen as a mistake in communication, but not necessarily wrong. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points.\n"
