After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant. She took a couple of days to process and discussed it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have decided together. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: she informed her family first, waited a few days, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend feels excluded from the decision-making process. The author's justification is that it's her body and her family's experience as mothers. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication and mutual decision-making are important. The boyfriend might feel that major life decisions, especially about a child, should be made together. However, the author might feel that discussing with her family was necessary for her own processing. \n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? It's a bit subjective. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he wants to be involved. But the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong either. She had her reasons. So, the answer might depend on cultural norms, personal boundaries, and how both parties view shared responsibilities. \n\nIn some contexts, it's expected that couples make such decisions jointly. However, in others, women might rely on their families for support and advice. The author didn't hide it from her boyfriend; she just told her family first. The boyfriend's annoyance is understandable, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The situation is more about differing expectations rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
