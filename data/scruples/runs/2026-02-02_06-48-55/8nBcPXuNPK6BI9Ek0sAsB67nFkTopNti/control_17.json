After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about telling family first before the boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she talked to her family first. Her boyfriend feels excluded because he's the father and they should have discussed it together. The author justifies it by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, so they could offer advice.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. In many relationships, both partners are involved in major decisions, especially regarding pregnancy. Not discussing with the boyfriend immediately might be seen as not respecting his role. However, the author's reasoning is that she was uncertain about how he'd react and wanted support from her family first. \n\nBut pregnancy is a shared responsibility. Even though the decision to keep the child is hers medically, involving the boyfriend in the decision-making process is important for the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, which is valid because he's part of the couple now. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of medical decisions, but ethically, there's a gray area. The main issue is communication and partnership. She made a significant life decision without her partner, which could hurt the relationship. However, her intent was to seek support, not to exclude him. \n\nSo, whether she's in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the question is about the boyfriend's feelings and the partnership aspect, then she might be in the wrong. But if it's strictly about her right to make the decision, she's justified. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here. The boyfriend's perspective is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong either. The key is that communication is important, and she didn't communicate with him first. But her actions were out of seeking support, which is understandable. So, maybe B is the right answer, but with a note that both have valid points.\n"
