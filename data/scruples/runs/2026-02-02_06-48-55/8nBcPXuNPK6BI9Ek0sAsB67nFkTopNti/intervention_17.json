After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister right away. Then she spent a few days thinking things over with her family. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she went to her family first and made the decision without him. The author says she can see his point but feels it's her choice since it's her body and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication in a relationship and shared decision-making. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because a major life event like a pregnancy would typically be a joint decision. On the other hand, the author might feel that consulting her own family, especially mothers, is natural and that she had the right to process the news on her own first.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from the fact that he wasn't involved in the initial decision. Even though the author eventually told him and they decided to keep the baby together, the fact that she went to her family first without him might have caused him to feel excluded. In a committed relationship, partners usually expect to be included in major decisions affecting both of them.\n\nHowever, the author might have needed time to process the news and discuss it with her own family first. Her family's experience as mothers could have provided support. That being said, not informing her partner immediately could still be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. The decision to have a child affects both people's lives, so the partner's involvement is important.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit tricky. While her actions are understandable, the boyfriend's reaction is also valid. If the relationship is built on mutual trust and shared decision-making, then the author might have been wrong to not include her boyfriend from the start, even if just to discuss her intentions. However, if there was no prior discussion about how such news should be handled, it's a gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no absolute right or wrong here, but leaning towards the idea that the author should have included her boyfriend in the discussion sooner, even if just to let him know she was considering it. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but with some nuances.\n"
