After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think over and discussed it with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was okay with the pregnancy but was annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. He feels it's their child and they should have decided together.\n\nThe author's defense is that she wanted to process the news and consult her family, especially since they are mothers themselves. She doesn't feel she's in the wrong because it's her choice.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. In relationships, communication is key. Both partners should feel included in major decisions. The author made a significant life decision without informing her partner immediately, even though she had time to think and discuss. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. \n\nBut, pregnancy is a woman's health issue, and she might have valid reasons to talk to her family first. The mother and sister, being mothers, could provide support and advice. However, not informing the partner in a timely manner can lead to feelings of being left out, especially since the partner was okay with the pregnancy once told. \n\nIt's a balance between personal autonomy and partnership. The author acted on her need for family support, which is understandable. The boyfriend's point about it being their child is also valid. The key here is whether the delay and the decision-making process without him were justified. \n\nIn many cases, transparency and communication are emphasized in relationships. Even if the author felt the need to process, perhaps informing the boyfriend earlier would have been better, even if she wasn't sure. But since she did tell him eventually and he was supportive, maybe the main issue is the timing and not the decision itself. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, her actions were out of seeking family support. On the other, her partner felt excluded. The answer might depend on the relationship's norms and how both parties communicate. But in general, if the boyfriend is an equal partner, sharing such news promptly is important. However, since she didn't hide it and told him eventually, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer here would be B (No), because the situation is more about differing expectations in communication rather than her being wrong. The key is that she didn't maliciously exclude him, but rather needed to process the news with her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
