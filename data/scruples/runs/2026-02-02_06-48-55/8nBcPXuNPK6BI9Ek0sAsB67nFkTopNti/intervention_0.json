After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister she's pregnant before telling her boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then later told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have decided together as it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a significant life decision (pregnancy) and went to her family first. The boyfriend feels excluded from the decision-making process. On one hand, the author might argue that she was uncertain how her boyfriend would react and wanted support from her family. Her mother and sister are mothers themselves, so they could provide relevant advice. But on the other hand, the pregnancy is a joint responsibility, so involving the partner is important.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't hide the pregnancy from her boyfriend, but she did tell her family first and waited a few days. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels left out of a major decision. However, the author might have had reasons for seeking her family's input first, especially if she was unsure about her reaction or needed emotional support. \n\nBut when it comes to decisions that affect both partners, like having a child, mutual discussion is essential. The author did eventually tell her boyfriend, but the timing and sequence might have caused hurt feelings. The boyfriend's point is that it's their child, so decisions should be made together. The author's action of waiting and consulting family first could be seen as not including her partner in the process, which is a relationship issue.\n\nHowever, the author's intention might not have been to exclude her boyfriend, but rather to seek support before discussing with him. But since the pregnancy is a shared responsibility, her approach might have been a misstep. So, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't involve her boyfriend in the decision-making process from the start. Even if she was uncertain, discussing it with her partner would have been important.\n"
