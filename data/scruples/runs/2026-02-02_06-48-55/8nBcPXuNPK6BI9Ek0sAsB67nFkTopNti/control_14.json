After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. Her boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child. She says it's her choice and she doesn't feel wrong, especially since her family are mothers who could offer support.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication in a relationship. In a committed relationship, major decisions like having a child usually involve both partners. The author's action was to consult her family first and then the boyfriend, which might have made the boyfriend feel left out. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's a co-parent and might expect to be involved in the decision. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that it's her choice and she sought advice from her family, who are experienced in parenting. However, the boyfriend's point is that the decision is shared. So, is she in the wrong? Well, it's a bit of a judgment call. The author didn't necessarily do something unethical, but she didn't include her partner in the initial discussions. In relationships, transparency and mutual decision-making are important. Even if the decision was hers to make, involving the partner from the start could have prevented the boyfriend's annoyance. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't include her boyfriend in the initial decision-making process, which is crucial for a shared life decision. But some might argue B (No) since she had her reasons and the decision was hers to make. However, in most cases, a partner's input on such matters is expected, so leaning towards A.\n"
