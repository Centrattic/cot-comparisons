After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her family first, took a few days to decide to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. He was upset because he thought they should have discussed it together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's boyfriend is upset that she involved her family first and made decisions without him. He feels it's their child, so they should have decided together. On the other hand, the author thinks it's her choice because it's her body and her family, who are mothers themselves, could provide support.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. In relationships, communication is crucial. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a major decision. Even though it's her body, the emotional and life impact on both partners is significant. However, the author's actions were to seek support from her family, which is natural. She did involve her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay after the fact.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm here? Some might say that in a committed relationship, both partners should discuss such big news together. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed and needed support first. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the decision-making process. But the author's decision to keep the baby was made after discussions with her family, not necessarily without her boyfriend. She did tell him eventually, and he was supportive.\n\nSo, is she wrong? It depends on the relationship's expectations. If the couple had prior expectations of sharing such news together, then she might be in the wrong. But since there's no mention of that, and she did involve her boyfriend after making a decision, she might not be wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
