After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had a positive pregnancy test and immediately informed her family. She then took a few days to think and discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel that sharing the news with family first is natural, especially since her mother and sister are mothers themselves, and they could offer support. She might have wanted their input before discussing it with her boyfriend. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is valid because pregnancy is a shared responsibility. He might feel left out of the decision-making process, which is important for both partners.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. While it's common to share news with family first, involving the partner early is crucial when the decision affects both people. The author's actions might have been out of seeking support, but the boyfriend's perspective is about partnership. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. She did inform her boyfriend eventually, and he was supportive once told. However, the timing and the fact that she waited days to involve him could be seen as neglecting his role in the decision. Relationships require teamwork, especially in major life decisions like having a child. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were considered disrespectful or neglectful of her partner's input. While it's understandable to seek family advice, the decision to involve her partner immediately could have been a better approach to avoid hurt feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it with her boyfriend first, even if her intention was to seek support from her family.\n"
