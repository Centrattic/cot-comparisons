I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, took a couple of days to think it over, discussed with her family, and then told her boyfriend. He was upset because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author told her family first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's their child and they should have made the decision together. The author thinks it's her choice and doesn't feel wrong about consulting her family.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. It's a shared life decision, so communication and mutual decision-making are important in relationships. Not involving him right away could be seen as not respecting his role in the decision. But on the other hand, the author might have felt uncertain and needed support from her family first. Her family are mothers themselves, so they could provide valuable guidance.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a relationship standpoint, transparency and partnership are key. Telling family before the partner might be seen as not including the partner in the process. But the author might have had reasons like needing emotional support or wanting to process the information first.\n\nHowever, after deciding to keep the baby, she did tell her boyfriend, and he was upset about the delay. The fact that she waited a few days to think things over and then informed him after her family might have caused his frustration. The key issue is whether she should have included him from the start. Since it's their child, the decision affects both of them. So, maybe the author's approach could have been improved by involving her partner earlier, even if she needed to talk to her family first. But was she in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might say she's not wrong because it's her body and her choice, especially in the initial stages. Others might think that in a committed relationship, major decisions should be made together. \n\nThe answer might depend on the relationship's norms and communication style. If both parties usually make decisions together, then not including the partner could be wrong. If the author felt overwhelmed and needed time, maybe she had her reasons. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's reasoning is also understandable. It's a bit of a gray area. But according to the question, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the boyfriend was a co-parent and the decision affects both, the answer might lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she decided without including him. However, others might argue B (no) because it's her health and decision initially. The answer could be B if the focus is on her right to make the decision, but A if the focus is on partnership. I think it's more likely that the answer is B because the decision to have the child is hers, and consulting family first is her choice. The boyfriend's concern is about communication, but it's not necessarily her fault for seeking family support. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
