After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed it with her family for a few days before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together, considering it's their child. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, which might have influenced her decision.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. In relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from an important decision. Even though the author involved her family, the expectation in a relationship is that major life decisions, especially those involving both partners, should be discussed together. \n\nThe author might have thought she was seeking support from her family, which is understandable. However, the timing and the fact that she waited a few days without informing her boyfriend could lead to feelings of being left out. The boyfriend's point is valid because the pregnancy affects both of them, and joint decision-making is typically expected in such cases.\n\nBut the author also has a valid point in seeking advice from her family, especially since they have experience as mothers. The question is whether the order of disclosure was the issue. In some contexts, telling family first isn't inherently wrong, but when a partner is involved, it's important to consider their feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she didn't intend to exclude her boyfriend, but she did make the decision without him. On the other hand, she had her reasons for consulting her family first. The key here is that the boyfriend felt wronged, and the author acknowledged his point but still stood by her actions. \n\nIn these situations, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework often considers intent and harm. The author's intent was to seek support, but the harm is the boyfriend's feelings of exclusion. The answer hinges on whether the author should have prioritized involving her partner first. Since the decision affects both, it's reasonable for the boyfriend to expect to be included in the decision-making process. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including her boyfriend from the start, even if her actions were well-intentioned.\n"
