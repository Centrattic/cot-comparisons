After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The author found out she was pregnant, called her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together.\n\nHmm, first, the situation involves a relationship between a couple. The key points here are communication and mutual decision-making. The author made a decision to inform her family first and then shared the news with her partner. The boyfriend is upset because he believes that such a significant decision\u2014like having a child\u2014should be discussed as a couple. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she might have felt the need to talk to her family because they are mothers themselves, perhaps for advice or emotional support. She also mentioned taking time to decide to keep the pregnancy and then informing her boyfriend. However, the boyfriend's reaction is valid because involving each other in major life decisions is important in a relationship. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, sharing news with family for support is understandable. On the other hand, a partner might feel left out of the loop, especially regarding a decision that affects both of them. The author acknowledges the boyfriend's point but still feels she's not wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to consider the other person's feelings. Even if the author had her reasons, the boyfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid. The fact that the author decided alone might have been a misstep, even if her intentions were good. However, the situation isn't black and white. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might depend on cultural norms, the couple's communication style, and their expectations. But generally, the boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be involved in such a significant decision. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including her partner in the decision-making process from the start.\n"
