After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then told her mom and sister. She was unsure how her boyfriend would react, so she discussed it with her family and decided to keep the baby. Then she told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because she talked to her family, who are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, decision-making in a relationship, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because it's a shared responsibility. However, the author had her reasons\u2014uncertainty about how he'd react, needing support from her family, and consulting them. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are important. The author did inform her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay with the decision. The conflict here is about the order of informing. The boyfriend might feel that major life decisions should be mutual. On the other hand, the author might feel that involving her family first was necessary for support and guidance.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she had her reasons and communicated with her family. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The key is whether there was open communication. Since the author did inform her boyfriend eventually and he was receptive, maybe the issue is more about the initial decision-making process. But the author's actions don't seem malicious; she was seeking support and guidance from her family, which is common. The boyfriend's annoyance is understandable, but the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
