After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister before her boyfriend. She took a few days to think about it, discussing with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was upset because she didn't include him in the decision and told her family first. He believes they should have decided together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out, which is a valid feeling. In a committed relationship, major decisions like having a child usually affect both partners, so involving each other is important. However, the author had her reasons: she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she sought support from her family first. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit subjective. On one hand, the boyfriend's reaction shows he values being part of the process. On the other, the author had her own reasons for involving her family first. \n\nBut considering that it's their child, the author should have included her boyfriend in the decision-making process even if she wasn't sure how he'd react. Waiting a few days to discuss with her family might have been necessary, but informing her boyfriend earlier could have helped. The author's action might be seen as not respecting her boyfriend's role in their shared future. \n\nHowever, cultural and family dynamics could play a role here. The author's family being mothers themselves might have been a source of advice she trusted. But the core issue is the communication between the couple. Even if the decision is ultimately hers, involving her partner is crucial for relationship health.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards yes (A), the author is in the wrong because she didn't include her boyfriend in the process despite it affecting both of them. But there's nuance because of her uncertainty about his reaction. Still, the primary issue is the lack of communication with her partner.\n"
