After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, took a few days to think things over, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made the decision to tell her family first, possibly because she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react. She considered the decision on whether to keep the baby and then informed her boyfriend, who didn't mind the news but was upset that she didn't include him in the initial discussions.\n\nThe main issue here is about the expectation of partnership in decision-making. The boyfriend feels that since the child is theirs, the decision should be made together. The author, however, believes that consulting her family was appropriate given that they are mothers and she was unsure about her own feelings and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, significant life events like a pregnancy are considered mutual decisions. However, the author's actions might stem from a place of seeking support from her family, especially since her mother and sister are mothers themselves, which could provide her with emotional support and advice.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on a desire for involvement in the decision-making process. He might feel that being left out, even if it was out of concern for his reaction, undermines his role as a partner. On the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for needing time to process the news and discuss it with her family first.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the couple had prior agreements or expectations about such situations, that would influence the answer. However, without that context, the author's actions might be seen as self-protective rather than wrong. She prioritized her own emotional state and sought support from family, which can be a valid approach. However, the fact that her decision to involve her family first led to her boyfriend's feelings of exclusion could mean there's room for both perspectives.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might side with the boyfriend's need for partnership, but others might empathize with the author's need to process the news. The key here is whether the author acted with malicious intent or simply out of uncertainty. Since she didn't keep the decision from him permanently and did involve him eventually, her actions might be seen as understandable, even if the boyfriend felt slighted.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of the boyfriend's feelings versus her own need for support. Given that she did involve her family and then her boyfriend, but the boyfriend felt excluded, it's a nuanced situation. However, since she didn't act with intent to harm or exclude her partner but rather due to personal uncertainty, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
