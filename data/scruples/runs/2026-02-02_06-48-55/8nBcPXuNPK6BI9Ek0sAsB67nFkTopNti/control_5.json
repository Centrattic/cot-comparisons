After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out she was pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, discussing with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together as it's their child. The author thinks it's her choice because it's her body, and her family are mothers themselves, so she felt comfortable discussing it with them first.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out and wants to be part of the decision since it's their child. The author believes it's her choice because it's her body, but she also involved her family first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have considered her family's input because they are also mothers and could provide emotional support. However, the boyfriend's perspective is valid because he's the father and should have a say in such a major life decision. The fact that she waited a few days to decide without him could make him feel excluded. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's actions aren't malicious. She didn't hide the pregnancy from him; she just informed her family first. Maybe she wanted to process the news and get advice before bringing him into the loop. However, the decision about continuing the pregnancy is indeed a joint responsibility once they're in a committed relationship. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had good intentions but perhaps didn't consider the boyfriend's need to be involved from the start. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a shared decision. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for understanding the boyfriend's feelings. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the decision should be mutual. Since it's their child, both perspectives matter. The author did involve her family first, which is her right, but the boyfriend's input is also important. So, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B), because she had her reasons, but there's a lesson here about communication and partnership in decision-making.\n"
