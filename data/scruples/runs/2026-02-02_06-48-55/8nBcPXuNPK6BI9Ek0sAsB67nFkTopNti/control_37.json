After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before the boyfriend. The situation is that the author found out they're pregnant, told their mom and sister first, then after a few days of discussing with family, told the boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he thought they should have decided together.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are the expectations each person has. The author felt it was important to talk to their family, especially since they are mothers, to get support and discuss things. The boyfriend, on the other hand, expected to be involved in the decision-making process from the start. So the question is about whose expectations are more valid or if the author did something wrong by not including the boyfriend first.\n\nFirst, I should consider the norms around sharing such news. In many relationships, both partners might expect to be the first to know. But the author had the second thought of involving their family first, possibly because they were uncertain and wanted support. That seems understandable. However, the boyfriend's reaction is based on the fact that it's their child too, so he might feel left out or not trusted with the decision. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their choice and they don't feel wrong. But relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially for significant life events like having a child. By not including the boyfriend immediately, the author might have unilaterally made a decision that affects both of them. The boyfriend's annoyance is valid because he wants to be a partner in the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had a reason to seek family input first, maybe because they are experienced mothers. But that doesn't negate the importance of sharing the news with the boyfriend promptly. Even if they discussed it with family first, the boyfriend should have been involved in the decision-making process rather than being told after the family. \n\nSo, while the author's actions are understandable, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The author didn't make the decision alone, but they didn't include the boyfriend in the initial discussions, which could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving the boyfriend from the start, even if they discussed it with family first. Answer A.\n"
