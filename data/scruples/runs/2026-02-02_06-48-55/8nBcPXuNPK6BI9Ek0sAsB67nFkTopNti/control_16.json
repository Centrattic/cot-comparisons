After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story found out they were pregnant and told their mom and sister before their boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning was that they were unsure how to handle the news and needed time to think, so they discussed it with their family first. They mention that their family are both mothers, which might have made them a good support system. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that since it's their child, they should have been involved in the decision-making process from the start.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual decision-making are key. The author did tell the boyfriend eventually, and he was okay about the pregnancy, but the issue was the order of disclosure. The author's choice to confide in family first could be seen as a personal right, especially since major life decisions like this can be stressful. However, the boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of partnership. Even if the author made the right decision in the end, not including the partner initially might have caused unnecessary hurt or a sense of being excluded.\n\nBut the author also has the right to privacy and personal choice. The decision to tell family first might be more about seeking support and guidance, which is a natural response. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from feeling left out of the process, which is valid if both partners are expected to co-parent and make decisions together.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking family support, but the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The key factor is whether the decision to tell family first was made with the intention of excluding the boyfriend or not. Since the author did involve the boyfriend eventually and he was informed, maybe the main issue is the delay and the initial decision-making without him. However, the author had valid reasons for needing time and support.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible that the boyfriend's feelings are justified, but the author isn't entirely at fault either. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations. In some contexts, expecting a partner to be the first to know is standard, but in others, family support is crucial. The fact that the author chose to involve the boyfriend after consulting family might mitigate the issue. Ultimately, both parties need to communicate and understand each other's perspectives. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on how to handle such situations in the future.\n"
