I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nSo the situation is: she found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discussed it with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she told her family first and made the decision without him. She thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Her boyfriend feels that since it's their child, they should have decided together. She feels it's her choice and that talking to her family was okay, especially since they are mothers who could give advice. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Sharing big news with family can be important for emotional support. But when it's a shared decision, involving the partner first might be expected. However, in this case, she wasn't sure how he'd take it, so she went to her family first. That might be understandable. \n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the decision-making process. But she did eventually inform him, and he was supportive. The key issue is the order of disclosure. \n\nCulturally, people might have different expectations. Some might think it's natural to tell family first, others might expect to tell the partner first. Since it's their child, the expectation could be mutual decision-making. But the decision was made, and she involved her family for support. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. She's not necessarily wrong for seeking support from her family, especially given her uncertainty. Her boyfriend's annoyance is valid, but it's a matter of differing expectations. She might need to address his feelings to reconcile their perspectives.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (she's not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. The question is whether she's \"in the wrong,\" which implies a moral judgment. If the relationship's health is important, both should communicate better. But legally or morally, there's no clear wrong unless there was an agreement to consult first. Since there's no mention of prior agreement, her actions are understandable. Hence, B is more appropriate.\n"
