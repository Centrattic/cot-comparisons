After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister she was pregnant before telling her boyfriend. Then she discussed it with her family for a few days before deciding to keep the pregnancy. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman made the decision to tell her family first, possibly because she was unsure how her boyfriend would react. She had tests and needed to process the news. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that since it's their child, they should have discussed it together. \n\nSo the question is whether she was wrong to inform her family before her partner. From a relationship perspective, sharing such major life news with each other first is usually expected. However, her reasoning was that she wasn't sure how he'd react and wanted to process it with her family first. She also mentions that after deciding, she told him, and he was okay, but still felt the process was wrong.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she had the right to confide in her family, especially since her mom and sister are mothers themselves, which might give her emotional support. On the other hand, not involving her partner in the initial decision-making could be seen as not being transparent. But she did eventually tell him, and they're now discussing it together. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is valid because it's their child, so he might feel left out. But if she was genuinely unsure about how he'd react, maybe she had her reasons. It's a matter of communication and mutual respect. The key points are whether she intended to include him eventually and if they had the decision-making process together afterward. \n\nI don't think she's entirely in the wrong. She made a choice based on her need to process the news and seek support. But maybe she should have considered her boyfriend's feelings more by involving him earlier. However, the post states she didn't feel in the wrong, and the boyfriend was \"pretty great\" about it afterward. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
