After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her family first, and then her boyfriend was upset about not being told immediately. He felt they should have decided together as it's their child. She thinks she's not in the wrong because she discussed it with her family, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication in a relationship and shared decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a major life decision. The author's defense is that she took time to process with her family and that the decision is hers to make. \n\nIn relationships, partners often expect to be the first to know about significant news, especially regarding their future together. The author's action might be seen as prioritizing family over the partner, which could cause hurt feelings. However, the author's reasoning is about seeking support from her own family, which is also valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's point is about shared responsibility since it's their child. The author acknowledges his point but still believes her choice was right. \n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. While the author's intent was to seek support from her family, the boyfriend's feelings of being left out are understandable. The decision to keep the pregnancy is a joint one in a committed relationship. However, the author did eventually share the news with her boyfriend and they are moving forward together. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't inherently wrong for seeking family support, but she might have overlooked her boyfriend's expectations. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her need for family support. \n\nIf I had to choose, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because she did inform her partner eventually and he was supportive. However, the initial decision to inform family first could be seen as a misstep in communication. But since the question is about being in the wrong, it's a bit subjective. The key is whether the action caused harm. The author's action led to the boyfriend being annoyed, but maybe not wrong. So perhaps answer B.\n"
