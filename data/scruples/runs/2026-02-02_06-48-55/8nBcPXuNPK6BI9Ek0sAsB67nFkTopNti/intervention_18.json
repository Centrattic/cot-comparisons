After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author mentioned that she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she discussed it with her family first. Her boyfriend felt left out because he thinks it's their child and they should have made the decision together. She does acknowledge his point but still believes she's not wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when a couple is in a committed relationship, especially planning to have a child, major decisions like this should ideally be made together. The author made the decision to tell her family first and then informed the boyfriend later, which might have made him feel excluded. Even though her family has experience as mothers, the boyfriend is the partner involved, so his perspective is important here.\n\nBut then again, the author's reasoning is that she wasn't sure how he would react and needed to process the news herself. That makes sense too. People might need time to come to terms with such news. However, the boyfriend's reaction shows that he felt it was a joint decision, which is reasonable given the child is part of their future together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, sharing the news with family first isn't inherently wrong, especially if she needed support. On the other hand, the boyfriend's feelings are valid because they are in a partnership. The key issue is whether the decision to tell the family first without consulting him was the right approach. Since the author did eventually tell him and they are now moving forward, maybe the intention wasn't to exclude him but to seek advice first. However, the timing and the fact that she waited a few days without involving him might have contributed to his frustration.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if she needed time, perhaps she could have discussed with him as well, even if just to say, \"I'm going to talk to my family first, but I need to involve you in the decision.\" But since she didn't, and he felt left out, there's a valid point to his reaction. The author's stance is that it's her choice, which is true to an extent, but shared decisions in a partnership often require mutual input.\n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's valid feelings and the expectation of joint decision-making in a relationship, I think the author might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
