After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before telling her boyfriend. Then she decided to keep the baby, and when she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she told her family first and made decisions without him. The author thinks it's her choice, especially since her mom and sister are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about communication and decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels that they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author, on the other hand, believes it's her choice and that consulting her family first was okay.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, in a relationship, major decisions like having a child are typically seen as joint responsibilities. The boyfriend might feel excluded or not trusted, which could lead to resentment. Even if the author thought her family could provide support, not involving her partner in the initial decision might be seen as not respecting their partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt overwhelmed and needed support from her family first. Her family members are also mothers, so maybe she felt they could offer relevant advice. However, even if that's the case, involving her partner from the start is usually important in a committed relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is about being part of the decision-making process, which is valid because the child will affect both of their lives.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It might depend on the norms of the relationship and how they communicate. But generally, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be mutual. The author did make a choice without including her partner, which could be seen as a mistake. However, she did decide to keep the baby, and the boyfriend was understanding once he was told. Still, the initial decision to tell family first and make a choice without him might be where the wrong lies. It's about respect and shared responsibility in the relationship.\n"
