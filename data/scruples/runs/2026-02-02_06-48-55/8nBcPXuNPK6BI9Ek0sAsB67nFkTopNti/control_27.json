After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before informing her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he wanted to be involved in the decision-making process. The author defends her actions by saying she wasn't sure how he'd react and that her family, being mothers themselves, could provide support.\n\nSo, the central issue is about communication and decision-making in a relationship. The question is whether the author made a mistake by not involving her boyfriend first. \n\nOn one hand, the author had her reasons: uncertainty about her boyfriend's reaction and seeking support from family. Her family might offer different perspectives, especially since they are mothers. It's not uncommon for someone in her situation to turn to family first for emotional support.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend felt left out and that the decision was made without him. The child is theirs, so he might expect to be part of the discussion. In a relationship, major life decisions typically require mutual input. The author's decision to delay telling her boyfriend until after involving her family could be seen as not valuing his partnership in the decision-making process.\n\nBut then again, the author's actions might be more about her need to process the news and seek immediate support. It's possible she didn't want to burden him immediately or she wasn't ready to discuss it with him yet. However, the boyfriend's reaction highlights the expectation of shared responsibility in such matters.\n\nThe dilemma here is between the individual's right to seek support and the partner's expectation of being included. Cultural and personal relationship expectations can influence this. If the relationship emphasizes teamwork, then the author's approach might be seen as a misstep. However, if the focus is on individual autonomy, her actions could be justified.\n\nI need to consider if there's a standard right or wrong here. Relationships are complex, and what might be acceptable in one context could be problematic in another. The key factor is whether the author's actions caused significant harm or disrespect. She did eventually involve her boyfriend, and he was okay with the pregnancy once informed. The issue is more about the order of communication rather than the decision itself.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if her intention was to seek support and she did involve her boyfriend later. However, if the expectation in the relationship was to discuss major life changes together, then she might have failed to meet that expectation. The boyfriend's reaction indicates that he felt excluded, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no absolute right or wrong, but the author might have a point in needing her family's support first. However, the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. The answer depends on the relationship dynamics and mutual expectations. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to decide based on typical relationship norms. Often, partners expect to be involved in key decisions together. By informing her family first and taking time to decide without him, she might have overlooked his right to be part of the process. So, the answer might lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The author's reasoning is understandable, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). It's a tough call.\n"
