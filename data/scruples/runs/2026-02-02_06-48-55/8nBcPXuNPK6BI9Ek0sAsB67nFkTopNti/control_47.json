After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took a couple of days to process, and discussed it with her family first. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The boyfriend argued that since it's their child, the decision should be mutual. The author, however, thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are also mothers who could offer support.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be involved in the decision-making process. It's natural for a partner to feel that major life decisions, especially about parenthood, should be discussed together. The author's action might come off as not including him in what's a shared responsibility. However, the author also had a valid reason to seek support from her family, especially since they have experience as mothers. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. While the author had her reasons, not informing the boyfriend immediately could have caused hurt or feelings of exclusion. The boyfriend's reaction is about partnership, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the author's need to process and discuss with her own family is understandable.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's actions aren't malicious. However, in a relationship, decisions about children typically involve both partners. By not including him from the start, she might have overlooked his perspective. But it's not necessarily a clear right or wrong. \n\nThe question asks if she's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations. If the relationship's norm is to make major decisions together, then she might be in the wrong. But if she felt she needed time to process and had her family's support, it's more about differing needs. \n\nIn most cases, the partner would expect to be involved in such a significant decision. So, while her intentions were to seek support, the timing and inclusion of her partner might have been mishandled. Therefore, there's a case to be made that she is partially in the wrong because she didn't involve him from the beginning. However, it's not an absolute right or wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because the boyfriend's perspective is valid, but B (No) if considering her need to process with her family. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that the decision affects both partners, the author should have included her boyfriend in the initial discussions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A. However, others might argue that her actions were reasonable. \n\nConsidering typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. Her intent was to seek support, but the impact was hurting her partner's feelings. The partner's reaction is about partnership. The answer could be B if the community sees her actions as acceptable, or A if they see the partner's inclusion as necessary. \n\nGiven that the decision to have a child is a joint responsibility, not informing the partner before family could be seen as a mistake. However, the author's explanation about needing time is a mitigating factor. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of the boyfriend's right to be involved, the answer might be A. But if the question is about whether she's in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her actions were to seek support from her family first, but others might say A. However, based on the reasoning that she made a decision that affects both of them without consulting him, the answer could be A. But since she did eventually tell him and the decision was kept, and she had her reasons, maybe B is the answer.\n"
