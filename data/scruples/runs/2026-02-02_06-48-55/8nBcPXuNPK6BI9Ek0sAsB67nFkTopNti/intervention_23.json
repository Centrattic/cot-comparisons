After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her family about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. So, the situation is that the author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because she wanted to talk to her family, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not). Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's perspective: he's upset because it's their child, so he feels he should have been involved in the decision-making process. He might feel left out or not trusted. On the other hand, the author's reasoning is that she needed to discuss it with her family first, especially since they are mothers and could provide support. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, relationships often require communication and mutual respect. The author made a decision without including her partner, which can be seen as not respecting his role in the situation. However, she did eventually tell him and they are now discussing it. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because co-parents usually expect to be part of such decisions. \n\nBut the author might have had her reasons, like seeking emotional support from her family first. It's a common thing for people to go to their family for support during big life events. However, the key issue is that she didn't consult her partner before making decisions that affect both of them. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the couple had previously agreed on how to handle such situations, that would matter. But since they didn't, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. The author might have considered her partner's feelings here. But she also has the right to seek support from her family. \n\nIn many cases, sharing big news with family first isn't inherently wrong, but not including the partner in the decision-making when it's a shared responsibility could be seen as problematic. The author's decision to keep the baby affects both her and her boyfriend, so ideally they would have discussed it together. \n\nBut the author did tell her boyfriend eventually and they are now working through it. The main issue is the timing and not involving him in the initial decision. So, maybe she is in the wrong because she didn't consider his feelings or the partnership aspect. Alternatively, she might not be wrong because she sought support from her family, which is a natural response.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and the relationship's dynamics. However, in many contexts, involving the partner in such a significant decision is expected. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including her boyfriend in the initial discussions, even if her intention was to seek family support. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, she's wrong). But wait, the user said they think she's in the wrong and want my opinion. Let me check again.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't tell her boyfriend immediately. She waited a few days to think over and discuss with her family. Maybe the delay and not involving him in the decision-making process is where the problem lies. The boyfriend's point is valid because it's their child. So, even though she had her reasons, the boyfriend's feelings are legitimate. The author's actions might have caused unnecessary hurt, so she's in the wrong. Hence, Answer A.\n"
