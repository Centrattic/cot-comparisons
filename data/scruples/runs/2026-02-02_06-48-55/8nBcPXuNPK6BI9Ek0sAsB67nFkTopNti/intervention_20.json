After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. Her reasoning was that she wasn't sure how he'd react and wanted to discuss it with her family first. Then she decided to keep the baby, told her boyfriend, and he was upset because she didn't include him in the decision-making and told her family first.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to decide between A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with her boyfriend, and they are expecting a child together. The key issue is the order in which she shared the news. Typically, in relationships, major life decisions like a pregnancy are considered to be between the two partners. By informing her family first without her partner, she might have breached that trust or the expectation of shared decision-making.\n\nBut she also said she took a few days to think things over with her family and then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author sees her family as a support system since they are both mothers. \n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. From a relationship perspective, big decisions involving both partners should ideally be made collaboratively. The author made the decision to keep the baby before discussing it with her boyfriend, which he found frustrating. This could be seen as not respecting his role in the partnership, even if her intention was to seek support from her family. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was genuinely unsure about how her boyfriend would react and wanted to process the news with her own family first, that might be understandable. However, once she made a decision, the boyfriend's reaction was about being excluded from the process. \n\nThe boyfriend's point is valid because the child will be theirs, and his input should matter. The author's actions might have undermined his feeling of being part of the team. Even if her family had good intentions, the decision to keep the baby should involve both parents. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, the act of making the decision without her partner could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, she might be in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. It's possible that the boyfriend's reaction is based on personal hurt feelings rather than a right or wrong scenario. However, the fact that she didn't include him in the decision-making process does suggest a lack of communication, which is important in a relationship. \n\nIn many cases, the expectation is that the partner is the first to be informed about such a significant life event. Telling family first, even with good intentions, might be a breach of that norm. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But I should check if there are any mitigating factors. The author didn't hide the pregnancy but waited a few days, which might be reasonable if she needed time to process. However, the decision-making part is more critical. \n\nI think the main issue is the decision being made unilaterally. Even if she discussed it with her family, the boyfriend's perspective is that he should have been part of the discussion. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
