After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, and then told her mom and sister. She says she wasn't sure how to proceed and needed time to think with her family. After deciding to keep the baby, she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have decided together. The author thinks it's her choice since it's her body, but the boyfriend feels it's their child and wanted to be part of the decision-making.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made the decision independently, informed her family first, and the boyfriend feels left out. The question is whether the author was wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has the right to make decisions about her own body and her pregnancy. Her family being mothers themselves might have given her support and insights. The decision to keep the baby is a significant life choice, and she might have needed time and emotional support from her family. However, the boyfriend's reaction is valid too. Since they're in a committed relationship, he would naturally feel involved in such a major decision. Not including him could lead to feelings of being excluded, which is understandable. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally and morally, the decision to continue a pregnancy is hers to make. However, relationships often require communication and joint decision-making. By not involving her partner from the start, she might have overlooked his emotional needs and the partnership aspect. That doesn't mean she's wrong, but it could have been a misstep in communication. \n\nThe author acknowledges the boyfriend's point but still feels she's not in the wrong. The question is about whether she actually is. Since the decision is hers to make, especially in terms of her body, but the relationship dynamic might have been affected by not including him. However, there's no concrete right or wrong answer here\u2014it's more about the balance between personal autonomy and relationship partnership. \n\nIn many cases, couples do discuss major life decisions together, so the boyfriend's reaction is a common one. But the author had her reasons for involving her family first. It's a valid approach, but it's possible she could have communicated better with her boyfriend, even if she made the decision independently. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the act of not involving the partner at all was wrong. Since the decision is ultimately hers, but the relationship aspect might have been affected, maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) for not considering his feelings, or B (not in the wrong) because it's her choice. \n\nBut given that the boyfriend felt left out and the author could have included him in the process even while seeking family support, maybe the answer is A. However, some might argue she's not in the wrong because the decision is hers. It's a tough call. The key is whether the decision-making process was respectful of the partner's feelings. The author didn't involve him in the decision, which could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, A might be the answer here.\n"
