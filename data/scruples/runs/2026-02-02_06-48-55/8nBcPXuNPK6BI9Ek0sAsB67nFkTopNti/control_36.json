After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then talked to her boyfriend later. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author thinks it's her choice and that she was right to involve her family first.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Relationships often require teamwork, especially big decisions like having a child. The boyfriend might feel excluded or not trusted if she didn't inform him first. However, the author might have had reasons to consult her family first, maybe for emotional support or advice.\n\nBut the key point here is communication. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a shared decision. Even if the author had good reasons, not including her partner in the initial conversation could cause hurt feelings. On the other hand, it's her body and her choice to make, and consulting family isn't inherently wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural or situational factors. Maybe the author was scared and needed support before talking to her boyfriend. But the boyfriend has a valid point about being part of the decision-making process. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. If the relationship requires mutual decision-making, then the author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the boyfriend's reaction is more about control, then the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn many cases, big life decisions are made together. The author made a choice that affected both of them, and while she had support from her family, the boyfriend might feel it's a partnership. So, maybe the answer is A because she didn't include him first. But it's a gray area. However, the question is about if she's in the wrong. The answer might depend on the relationship's norms. If the boyfriend expects to be the first point of contact for such news, then she is in the wrong. But if the author had her reasons and the boyfriend is overreacting, then B.\n\nBut the boyfriend's point is valid. The answer might be A. But the user wants a strict A or B. I think there's no clear right or wrong here, but since the boyfriend's reaction is about being excluded from a shared decision, maybe the answer is A. However, the author might not be in the wrong if she needed support first. It's a tricky call. But given the context, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable, so the author might be in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
