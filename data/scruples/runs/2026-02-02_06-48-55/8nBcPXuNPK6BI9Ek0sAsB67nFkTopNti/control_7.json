After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The key points here are the timeline and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nThe author found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister, waited a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could give good advice.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the process, which is understandable because a pregnancy affects both partners. However, the author might have felt the need to discuss with her family first for emotional support and guidance. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has a valid point that major life decisions should be made collaboratively, especially regarding a child. On the other hand, the author might have needed time to process the news and seek input from her own family before involving her partner. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author didn't consult her boyfriend during the decision-making period. Even if she needed time, keeping him informed and involved would have been important for their relationship. Her actions might have caused hurt feelings because he wasn't part of the initial discussions. \n\nSo, while her intentions might have been good, the timing and lack of communication with her boyfriend could be seen as a mistake. The decision to involve family is personal, but the exclusion of the partner in the process might be where she's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if cultural or relational norms affect this. In many relationships, both partners are expected to be part of such decisions. So, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, may have overlooked her partner's expectations.\n"
