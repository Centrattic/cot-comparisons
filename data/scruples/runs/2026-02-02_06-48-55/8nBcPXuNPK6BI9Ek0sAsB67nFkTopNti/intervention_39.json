After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. The author found out they were pregnant, told their family first, then the boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together, as it's their child. The author thinks it's their choice and isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is a woman, and in many cultures, there's a tendency for women to share such news with their families first, especially if they're close. The family being mothers themselves might have provided support and advice, which is important for the author's decision-making process. Also, the author didn't hide the pregnancy; they told the boyfriend eventually. The timing is the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be part of the decision since it's their child. He might feel that major life decisions should be made jointly in a relationship. The author made the decision to keep the baby before informing him, which could be seen as not being inclusive of his feelings or input. Even if the decision was made, sharing the news with family first might have been necessary for the author, but the boyfriend's perspective is valid in terms of partnership.\n\nBut is it a case of right or wrong? It might depend on the relationship dynamics. If they have a history of making big decisions together, then the author's action could be seen as a breach. However, if the boyfriend isn't the person who should be primary in such decisions (like in some traditional setups where the father isn't involved as much), then maybe the author is justified. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author might have thought their family needed to know first, but the boyfriend expected to be informed immediately. The fact that he wasn't consulted in the initial decision could be a point of contention. However, the author did eventually tell him and they reached a mutual decision. \n\nWait, the author says they \"took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.\" So they were still considering the decision with family before finalizing it. The boyfriend was told after the author had already made the decision to keep the baby. The boyfriend's annoyance is because he wasn't involved in the decision-making process. The author's reasoning is that it's her choice, and the family can offer support as they are mothers themselves. \n\nIn terms of fairness, while the author might have had good intentions, withholding the information from the boyfriend until after discussing with family could be seen as not being transparent. The boyfriend's perspective is that he should be part of the discussion, especially since it's their child. That's a valid point in a committed relationship. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because they made the decision as a primary parent without including the other parent. Even though the mother has the final say in some aspects, in a partnership, the other person's involvement is important. \n\nBut I need to be careful. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The key is that the question is from the boyfriend's point of view. The author's action might not be wrong in an absolute sense, but in the context of the relationship, it's a matter of how they communicated. The author could have told the boyfriend as soon as possible, even if they were still deciding. Maybe the delay wasn't necessary, and the decision to inform family first, then boyfriend, might have been a communication oversight. So the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But I should check if there's any nuance. If the boyfriend wasn't the immediate parent (like not the biological father?), but the scenario says \"my boyfriend,\" so he is the partner. Therefore, the author should have considered his feelings and included him in the discussion. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
