He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister before her boyfriend. She then decided to keep the baby, and when she told her boyfriend, he was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that she wanted to talk to her family because they are mothers themselves, which might provide support or advice. She mentions she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels that he should have been involved in the decision-making process since it's their child. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared decision-making. While the author had a valid reason to involve her family, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded. The question is whether it's wrong to tell family first. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions that affect both partners are usually expected to be discussed together. The author did eventually tell her boyfriend, but the timing and the fact that she made a decision without him could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. However, she might have had concerns about his reaction, which is understandable.\n\nCultural and personal relationship norms also play a role. If the couple had an understanding that such decisions should be mutual, then the author's actions might be seen as wrong. But if the boyfriend didn't have prior input on how to handle unexpected pregnancies, maybe it's more about communication going forward.\n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between seeking support from family and respecting the partner's role in shared decisions. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because seeking family support is common, but she should have involved her boyfriend earlier, especially since it's a mutual responsibility. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because despite her reasons, the decision should ideally be made together once the pregnancy is confirmed, even if she was uncertain about his reaction. Alternatively, B (no) if considering that her actions were a personal choice made with good intentions.\n"
