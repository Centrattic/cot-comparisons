After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. Her boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong. The user thinks she is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A or B. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, from her perspective, she might feel that her family, especially her mom and sister who are mothers, would be a support system. She might have needed their advice or emotional support before approaching the boyfriend. Also, she mentions she discussed it with her family before deciding to keep the baby, which makes sense. But she decided to keep it before involving her boyfriend in the decision, which is what he's upset about.\n\nThe boyfriend's point is that it's their child, so they should make decisions together. He might feel left out of an important decision. On the other hand, the author believes it's her choice, which is true in terms of autonomy over her body and decisions. However, in a relationship, communication and mutual decision-making are important. \n\nSo, is she wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally and ethically, she has the right to make decisions about her body. But relationally, not involving her partner in a major life decision could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. The key here is whether she considered their relationship's dynamics. If the boyfriend was part of her life and expected to be involved in such decisions, then her actions could be seen as not respecting his role in the relationship.\n\nHowever, if the relationship wasn't that established, or if there were other factors (like uncertainty about the relationship, fear of rejection, etc.), her actions might make sense. The scenario doesn't mention any prior issues, so it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require teamwork, especially regarding significant life events. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be included in the decision-making process. The author might have acted out of fear or uncertainty, but not consulting her partner could indeed be seen as a mistake. \n\nSo, leaning towards A (she's in the wrong) because while her decision is valid, the relational aspect is important, and she didn't include her partner in the process, which could harm their relationship. But some might argue B, as it's her body and she had a right to seek family support first. Hmm. The user thinks A, but I should consider both angles. The key is whether the author considered her partner's perspective. Since she made the decision alone, even with good intentions, it's a relational misstep. So, A.\n"
