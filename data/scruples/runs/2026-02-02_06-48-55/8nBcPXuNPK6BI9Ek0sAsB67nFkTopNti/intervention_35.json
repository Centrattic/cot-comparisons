After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for telling her family about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She took a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, and he was okay with the decision but upset that she didn't tell him first and involved her family without him. He felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are: 1) Telling family before the boyfriend, 2) Deciding without him, 3) The boyfriend's reaction about joint decision-making.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that it's her body, her decision, and she sought advice from her family, who are also mothers. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels it's their child, implying he has a right to be involved in the decision-making process. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel left out, especially if they're a couple and expect to make major life decisions together. Pregnancy is a significant life event that affects both partners. By not consulting him first, he might feel that his partner didn't value his input or consider him an equal in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did eventually share the decision with him, and he was okay with the choice. The issue here is the order of communication. Some might argue that the boyfriend's feelings are valid because he has a stake in the decision. Others might side with the author, emphasizing her autonomy and the fact that she did involve her family for support.\n\nCulturally, there might be different expectations. In some contexts, it's common for the woman to consult her immediate family first, especially in matters related to pregnancy. But in a committed relationship, partners often expect to be the first to know such news. The boyfriend's annoyance might stem from feeling that he wasn't given the respect of being the first to be informed and involved in the process.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author took a few days to think things over and discuss with her family could be seen as a way to process her own feelings, which is understandable. However, not involving her partner in that process might have caused the rift. The key here is the communication. Even if she had her reasons, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that he felt excluded, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a nuanced situation. If the couple has an established norm where major decisions are made jointly, then the author might be in the wrong for not following that. But if there's no such agreement, her actions could be seen as her right to make the decision. However, since the child is theirs, the boyfriend's perspective has weight.\n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong if she had her reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is about his own feelings of exclusion. But if the couple was expected to make such decisions together, then she might be in the wrong. The question is whether her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. In many cases, sharing such news with the partner first is expected, so maybe she is in the wrong here. So, the answer might be A (Yes) or B (No). But I'm leaning towards A because the boyfriend's reaction is about the joint decision, which is a valid point. However, the author's autonomy is also important. It's a tough call, but maybe A.\n"
