After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author was wrong to tell her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and immediately called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because she told her family first and made decisions without him. He felt it should have been a joint decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sequence of communication and the boyfriend's reaction. The author believes her family, being mothers themselves, could help her decide. The boyfriend feels it's their child together, so he should have been involved upfront.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, when a couple faces a major life decision like a pregnancy, it's usually expected to discuss it together. The author made decisions about telling her family and deciding to keep the baby without consulting her partner first. That could lead to feelings of exclusion or being undervalued in the relationship. Even though the author's intentions were to seek support from her family, the boyfriend's reaction is valid because he wants to be part of the process. \n\nHowever, the author's actions aren't necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. She might have felt more comfortable with her family first. But in terms of relational responsibility, sharing such news with the partner first, especially when it's a shared future, is generally considered important. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from not being included in the initial decision-making, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nSo, while the author isn't malicious, she could have handled it differently by informing her boyfriend first or at least discussing it with him before making decisions. Therefore, she might be in the wrong because she didn't include her partner in the process, which is crucial for a healthy relationship.\n"
