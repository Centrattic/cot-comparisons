After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. The author found out they're pregnant, told their family first, discussed it with them, decided to keep the baby, and then told their boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that involving their family first was necessary for support, especially since the family members are mothers themselves. They might have wanted immediate emotional support and guidance. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a major decision that affects both of them. It's a shared responsibility, so he might feel that his input was important from the start.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions are understandable. They might have been overwhelmed and needed to process the news with their family first. They did eventually share the decision with their boyfriend, and he was supportive. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is valid because a pregnancy affects both partners. Not involving him initially could make him feel excluded or undervalued in the relationship.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author did inform the boyfriend eventually, but the timing and the fact that they waited a few days might have caused tension. The boyfriend's annoyance likely stems from feeling that the decision wasn't a joint one. The author might argue that their family's experience was crucial in making the decision, but it's also important to consider the partner's feelings in such a significant life event.\n\nIn relationships, partners often expect to be involved in major decisions that affect both of them. While the author had their reasons, the boyfriend's reaction is a valid concern. The author could have perhaps discussed it with the boyfriend first and then still consulted their family, or at least made it a joint decision from the start. So, while the author's intentions might be good, the approach might have been flawed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including the boyfriend in the initial decision-making process.\n"
