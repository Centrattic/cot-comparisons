He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to decide what to do, discussed it with her family, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was okay with the pregnancy but was annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him. He felt they should have decided together because it's their child. She acknowledges his point but feels she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers too.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because major life decisions, like having a child, usually require mutual agreement. On the other hand, the author might have felt the need to confide in her family first, especially since they are mothers, for support and advice.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. Even though the author's intentions were to seek support from her family, not involving her partner in the initial decision-making might have caused hurt feelings. However, it's also common for people to turn to close family for immediate support in such situations. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is a valid emotional response. The author might not be entirely wrong, but she could have communicated better with her partner from the start to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on the expectations in the relationship. If both parties expected to make such decisions together, then not including him could be seen as a mistake. But if her approach was to seek family advice first and then include him, maybe she didn't do anything wrong. The fact that she told him eventually and he was okay with the pregnancy suggests that the core issue is about the timing and the decision-making process rather than the outcome.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong. It's more about how they handle the situation moving forward and ensuring better communication in the future.\n"
