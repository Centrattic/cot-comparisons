After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author found out she was pregnant, took a couple of days to process, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author thinks it was her choice and she's not wrong for talking to her family first.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics here. The key points are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of an important decision that affects both of them. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her choice to inform her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves and could offer support.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong depends on the relationship norms. In many relationships, major life events like pregnancy are considered shared responsibilities. However, the author might have her reasons for reaching out to her family first, maybe for emotional support or advice. But the boyfriend's perspective is valid too\u2014if they're a couple, decisions about their future child should be made jointly.\n\nBut the author did eventually inform the boyfriend and they both decided to keep the child. The delay was because she was processing the information and discussing with her family. However, the boyfriend's annoyance stems from not being included in the initial decision-making process. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking support from her family, especially if they are mothers and can provide relevant advice. But the boyfriend's point is also valid\u2014major decisions affecting both partners should involve both. The key here is whether the author considered her boyfriend's perspective and included him in the decision-making process. \n\nSince the author acknowledges the boyfriend's point but still doesn't feel in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the decision to inform her family first was a breach of trust or communication. But the boyfriend was informed eventually, and they made the decision together after. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how she handled the situation. \n\nIn many similar situations, the consensus is that both partners should be involved in such decisions. However, the initial action of telling family might not be inherently wrong, especially if the intention was to seek support. The issue is more about the communication with the partner. Since the author did eventually involve the boyfriend and they both agreed, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But there's a valid argument that she should have included her boyfriend from the start. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer could be B (No), but there's a nuance. The author isn't in the wrong, but the situation highlights the need for better communication between partners. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, the answer might still be B. Alternatively, if the main issue is the lack of joint decision-making, then A. But the key is that the author did involve her partner eventually, and the family are mothers who can offer support. So, leaning towards B.\n"
