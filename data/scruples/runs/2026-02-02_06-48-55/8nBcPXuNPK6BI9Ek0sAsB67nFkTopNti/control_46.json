I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then told her mom and sister first. She says she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it, so she took a few days to think it over with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was okay with it but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. She argues that it's her choice and her family are also mothers, so they could help.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. So, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process. Even though she's the one who's pregnant and has the medical decisions, the emotional and practical aspects of having a child together would typically involve both partners. By informing her family first and discussing it with them before telling her boyfriend, she might have undermined his role in the decision. That could be seen as a breach of trust or not giving him the opportunity to be part of the process.\n\nOn the other hand, she might have felt vulnerable or unsure and turned to her family, who are also mothers, for support and advice. That's understandable. However, in a committed relationship, major life decisions like this usually require mutual discussion. Even if she was uncertain, perhaps it would have been better to tell her boyfriend first or at least discuss the possibility before making decisions, even if they were tentative.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded. So, the key issue here is whether informing family first without the partner is wrong. It depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they're a team, then big decisions should be made together. However, she did eventually tell her boyfriend and they're moving forward. The question is whether she was in the wrong for not including him initially.\n\nIn many relationships, it's expected that both partners are involved in such major decisions. The fact that she waited a few days and discussed it with her family might be seen as not considering his feelings. So, maybe A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't include him in the initial decision-making. However, others might argue that it's her body and she had the right to seek support from her family first. But the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. So, probably the answer is A because she didn't communicate with her partner first, even if her intentions were to seek support.\n"
