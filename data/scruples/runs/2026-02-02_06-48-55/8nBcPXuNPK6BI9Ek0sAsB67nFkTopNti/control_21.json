He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to think things over and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have decided together. She argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could help.\n\nSo the main question is whether her actions were wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break down the key points. The author made a big life decision (keeping the child) and shared the news before her partner. The boyfriend feels it's their decision together, while she believes it's her choice and her family's support was necessary. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend felt left out, which is valid because major decisions involving a partner usually require mutual input. However, the author might have valid reasons too. She was processing the news, seeking support from her family, especially since they are mothers and could offer advice. \n\nBut did she overstep? If the couple is in a committed relationship, especially planning to raise a child together, making such a decision unilaterally could be seen as not respecting the partner's input. On the other hand, she wasn't hiding it; she told him after thinking things through. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. The author's stance is that the decision is hers, but in a partnership, even pregnancy decisions are typically shared. However, the author might have valid cultural or personal reasons for involving her family first. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, family plays a significant role in such decisions, and the woman's family might be the first to know. However, in a modern, partner-centric relationship, the partner would expect to be involved early. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the pregnancy is also a factor. If she had decided to terminate, she might not have told her family. Since she decided to keep it, she might feel she needed female support. But the boyfriend's perspective is about shared responsibility. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. But from a relationship standpoint, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The author might not be in the wrong if she had her reasons, but she could have communicated better with her partner from the start. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, big decisions in a relationship should be mutual. Since the pregnancy will affect both partners, the author might have a point in seeking her family's advice, but the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. \n\nI think the answer depends on the context of their relationship. If they have a history of making decisions together, then her not including him first could be seen as wrong. But if she felt she needed to process alone, maybe not. However, the main issue is that the decision affects both, so she should have discussed it with him as part of the process. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she made a decision that significantly impacts her partner without including him in the process. But others might say B (no), because she had her reasons and the decision is hers. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about not being included. The author's explanation is that she wasn't sure how he'd take it. However, waiting days without discussing could be seen as not respecting his input. \n\nI think the answer is A because even though she had reasons, the decision is for both of them, and she should have involved her partner from the beginning. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
