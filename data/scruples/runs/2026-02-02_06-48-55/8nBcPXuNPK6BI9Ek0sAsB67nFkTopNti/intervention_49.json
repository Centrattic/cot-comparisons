After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together, considering it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because she discussed it with her family first.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is the order in which the news was shared. The author made a big life decision\u2014whether to keep the pregnancy\u2014and involved her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt the need to consult her family, especially since they are mothers and could offer relevant support. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is valid because this is a shared decision. The author kept the news from him for a few days after deciding to keep the child, which could be seen as not being transparent.\n\nThe question is whether this action is inconsiderate. It's important to consider the relationship dynamics. If the boyfriend is a significant part of her life, withholding such information until after discussing with family might be seen as not respecting his role in the decision. However, the author might have had her reasons, like needing support from her family first.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many relationships, major decisions involving both partners would be made together. The author's action could be seen as prioritizing family input over the partner's immediate involvement. However, she did eventually share with him, and he was understanding once he was told. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the boyfriend felt left out and it's affecting their relationship, then maybe the author should have included him first. But if the family's role was crucial for her decision-making process, her approach isn't entirely wrong. The key issue is communication. The author could have discussed her plan with the boyfriend before involving the family, perhaps. \n\nSo, considering both sides, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't include her boyfriend in the decision-making process as a partner, which is a significant aspect of a committed relationship. Even if family support is important, the decision about a shared child should involve both partners from the start.\n"
