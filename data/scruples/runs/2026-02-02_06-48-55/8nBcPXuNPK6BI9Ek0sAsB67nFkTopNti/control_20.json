I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nSo the situation is that the author found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over and discuss with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was okay with it but was annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him. She acknowledges his point but feels she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because a pregnancy affects both partners. On the other hand, the author felt it was her choice and that discussing it with her family, especially her mother and sister who are also mothers, was appropriate for support and guidance.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, communication in relationships, and the expectations of each partner. In many relationships, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be made together. However, the author might have felt the need to process the information with her own family first, especially given the emotional weight of the decision. But the boyfriend's perspective is that he should have been involved from the start, as it's their child.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but maybe there's an expectation in the relationship that wasn't met. The boyfriend's reaction is about inclusion and shared responsibility. The author's action might be seen as her taking control of the decision, which could be justified given it's her body, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid too.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author should have discussed it with her boyfriend first. But since the decision was made to keep the baby and the boyfriend was informed, maybe the issue is more about the timing and process rather than the outcome. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's definitely room for both perspectives. However, in many cases, couples are expected to make such decisions together. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since she did eventually tell him and he was okay with the decision, maybe B is the answer. I need to think again.\n\nThe question is whether she is in the wrong. If the boyfriend was annoyed, but the author doesn't feel wrong, and the situation doesn't have a clear right or wrong, maybe the answer is B. The decision is ultimately hers, especially in modern relationships where women have autonomy. However, the boyfriend's expectation of being involved is also important. But since the author made the decision and then told him, perhaps she's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because it's her body and she made the decision to include her family for support, which is common.\n"
