After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together, as the child is theirs. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel that her family, especially her mother and sister who are mothers themselves, could provide support and advice. She might have been dealing with the news emotionally and needed to talk to her family first. Also, she ended up deciding to keep the pregnancy, which she then shared with her boyfriend, who was okay with it but upset about the order of disclosure.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. He's a co-parent, and major life decisions about their future should ideally be discussed together. By informing her family first and waiting a few days to tell him, he might feel excluded from the process. Even though she had a good reason, not including him in the initial decision-making could be seen as not valuing his role in the relationship.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual decision-making. While it's natural to seek support from family, significant decisions involving both partners should be approached collaboratively. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the boyfriend's feelings about being left out after the fact are valid. The answer hinges on whether the decision-making process was shared or if she acted unilaterally. Since the author decided to keep the pregnancy without consulting her boyfriend first, even if she discussed it with her family, she might be in the wrong for not including him in the initial decision. However, the boyfriend's reaction could also be seen as overly sensitive if the author's intentions were to consult family for support, not to make a final decision without him. But given that the decision was made without his input, even if he was told afterward, the boyfriend's perspective is that he was excluded from the process. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
