He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out they're pregnant, took two tests, then called their mom and sister first. They mentioned they were unsure how their boyfriend would react, so they took a few days to discuss it with family before telling him. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author thinks they're not in the wrong because it's their choice and their family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the decision-making process and the order in which the news was shared. The author's reasoning is that it's their body and choice, and their family can support them. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels left out of the decision, which is natural since it's their shared child. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's choice alone? In a committed relationship, major life decisions like this usually involve both partners. The author might have good intentions, thinking their family could offer maternal advice, but withholding the news from the boyfriend until after deciding could be seen as not including him in the process. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is a common issue in relationships when big decisions are made without mutual discussion.\n\nThe author might not be wrong in seeking family support, but the timing and the fact that they made the initial decision without the boyfriend could be problematic. It's important in relationships to communicate and make joint decisions, especially ones that affect both people. Even if the author was uncertain, bringing the boyfriend into the conversation earlier might have been better. \n\nSo, I think the author is partially in the wrong. They had a valid reason to consult their family, especially since they are mothers, but the boyfriend's perspective is about shared responsibility. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because not involving the partner in the decision-making process is a common expectation in relationships. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) if the author felt the need to consult family first due to uncertainty about the boyfriend's reaction. But typically, the partner is expected to be included early, even if there's hesitation. Therefore, the author probably is in the wrong to some extent, so answer A.\n"
