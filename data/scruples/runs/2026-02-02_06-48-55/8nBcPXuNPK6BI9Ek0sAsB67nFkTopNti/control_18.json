I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.

He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over, discussing with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. He was upset because she told her family first and made decisions without him. He wanted to make the decision together since it's their child. She acknowledges his point but feels she's not wrong because she talked to her family, who are both mothers themselves.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. So, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend might feel left out of the decision-making process. Since it's their child, he might feel that important decisions should be made jointly. On the other hand, the woman might feel that discussing it with her family, especially her mom and sister who are mothers, is a natural step and that she had the right to make the decision as it's her body.\n\nCultural norms and relationship dynamics play a role here. In many relationships, major life decisions are made together. However, the woman might prioritize her family's support, especially in a significant decision like carrying a pregnancy to term. The boyfriend's reaction could be about feeling excluded, which is a valid concern. But the woman's actions might be seen as seeking advice from those who understand the situation better.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It might depend on the expectations within the relationship. If they had prior agreements about such decisions, that's one thing. But if not, it's a conflict in values. The woman might not be in the wrong if she considered her family's input necessary, but the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since the decision to tell her family first is a personal choice and she did eventually involve her boyfriend, maybe the answer is no. But there's a middle ground where both need to communicate better.\n\nIn some cases, the act of making a major decision without the partner can be seen as dismissive. However, if she had her reasons (like needing support from her family) and shared her decision with him afterward, perhaps she isn't in the wrong. But there's a valid point in the boyfriend's side about shared decisions. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on typical societal views.\n\nIn many relationships, partners are expected to discuss such big decisions together. The woman made a decision without him, which could be seen as not considering his role as the other parent. But she also sought advice from her family, which is common. So there's a balance here. Maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B) because it's her body and she had her reasons, but there's room for improvement in communication with her partner. But the boyfriend's feelings are valid too. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about whose feelings are valid. If the boyfriend expected to be involved from the start, then she might be in the wrong. But if there was no prior agreement, it's a grey area.\n\nGiven the scenario, the woman did eventually tell her boyfriend and they discussed the decision. The key issue is the initial decision-making without him. However, since she involved her family for support, which is a common practice, it might not be her fault. So I think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation where both partners could have communicated better.\n"
