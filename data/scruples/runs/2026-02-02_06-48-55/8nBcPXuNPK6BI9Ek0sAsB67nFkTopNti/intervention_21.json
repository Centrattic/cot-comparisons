After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over and discuss with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. He was upset because he felt they should have decided together as it's their child. She acknowledges his point but feels it's her choice to consult her family first.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations in a relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her right to discuss with her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves. \n\nIs there a cultural or personal expectation of how such news should be shared? In many relationships, major life decisions are made jointly. The pregnancy is a significant event that affects both partners. By not informing her boyfriend immediately and instead involving her family first, she might have overlooked his need to be part of the process. \n\nBut then, the author might have her reasons. Maybe she felt more comfortable discussing it with family first to get their support before approaching her boyfriend. Also, her family being mothers could offer practical advice. However, the boyfriend's reaction highlights that he expected to be included in the decision-making from the start. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend and she had an understanding that such decisions would be made together, then she might be in the wrong. But if there was no prior agreement, her actions could be seen as her right to make the initial decision, given it's her body. \n\nBut the problem is that the decision affects both of them. Even though she took time to think, she didn't involve her boyfriend in that process. That could be seen as not respecting his partnership. On the other hand, she might have needed emotional support from her family first. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between personal agency and relationship partnership. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but she could have considered her boyfriend's perspective more by including him earlier. However, since the decision is ultimately hers, especially regarding her body, it's a bit of a grey area. But the boyfriend's reaction is valid because major life events should be discussed together. \n\nSo, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the decision impacts both partners, and open communication is key in a relationship. Even if she needed family support, she should have informed her boyfriend promptly and involved him in the decision-making process.\n"
