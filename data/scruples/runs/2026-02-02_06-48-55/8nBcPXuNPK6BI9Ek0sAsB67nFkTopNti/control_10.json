After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out she's pregnant and immediately told her mom and sister. She took a few days to think, discussed it with her family, decided to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together, as it's their child. The author argues that she consulted her family, who are mothers themselves, and that it's her choice ultimately.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend's reaction is valid. A major life decision like this typically involves both partners. By making the decision without him, even if she discussed it with her family, he might feel left out or not respected. Shared responsibility in a relationship is important. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might feel that her family, being mothers themselves, could offer the right support and advice. She might have felt uncertain about how her boyfriend would react, leading her to seek comfort from her own family first. Also, the timeline is a factor\u2014she did tell him after making the decision, and he was okay with it. \n\nHowever, communication in relationships is key. If she had discussed her concerns with him first or at least included him in the decision-making process, it might have prevented his hurt feelings. Even though she made a decision, he has a right to feel involved in such a significant matter. \n\nSo, while her intentions might be understandable, the fact that she made the decision without including her partner could be seen as a mistake. The boyfriend's perspective is valid, showing that shared decision-making is important in a relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving her boyfriend in the process, even if her family's input was helpful.\n"
