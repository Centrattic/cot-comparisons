After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The author found out she was pregnant, told her family first, waited a few days to think it over, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the order of disclosure and the communication between the couple. The author's reasoning is that she wanted to discuss it with her family, especially since they are mothers themselves, and she felt it was her choice. The boyfriend's concern is about shared decision-making since the child is theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many relationships, partners are expected to make major life decisions together. Pregnancy is a significant decision, affecting both people. By informing family first and waiting to discuss with her boyfriend, she might have overlooked his right to be part of the decision-making process. That could be seen as not respecting his input, even if her intention was to seek support from her family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author had the right to discuss her personal health and choices with her family first, especially since her mother and sister are mothers themselves and could provide relevant advice. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a decision that impacts both of them. The delay in telling him also contributed to his annoyance, as he wasn't part of the initial discussions.\n\nThe author does acknowledge her boyfriend's point, but maintains that it's her choice. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners' perspectives should be considered, especially when the decision affects both. The fact that she waited a few days to decide without him might have been a mistake, even if her intention was to seek family support.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's actions might be seen as not being considerate of her boyfriend's feelings and the shared nature of the decision. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not including him in the process from the start.\n"
