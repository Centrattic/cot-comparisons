After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that the author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed with her boyfriend later. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together as it's their child.\n\nSo, the key points here are the order of communication and the boyfriend's reaction. The author's reasoning is that she wanted to process the news with her family, especially since they are both mothers, and she felt it was her choice. The boyfriend, on the other hand, believes it's their child and should have been involved from the start.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. In a committed relationship, major life decisions like a pregnancy are typically considered joint responsibilities. The boyfriend's feeling of being excluded is valid because he's a parent to the child as well. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed and needed support from her family first. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. Some might argue that she should have included her partner from the beginning to respect his role. Others might say that consulting her family first is understandable, especially if they are close and have experience as mothers. The author does acknowledge the boyfriend's point but still feels she made the right choice.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The author isn't wrong for seeking support from her family, but she might have handled the communication better by including her partner earlier. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's part of the partnership. However, it's not necessarily a case of right or wrong. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, leaning towards A (yes) because she didn't include her partner first, even if her intentions were to process the news with her family. But wait, maybe B (no) because she had her reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is more about communication style than her being wrong. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is A, but maybe B. Need to decide based on typical perspectives on joint decision-making in relationships.\n"
