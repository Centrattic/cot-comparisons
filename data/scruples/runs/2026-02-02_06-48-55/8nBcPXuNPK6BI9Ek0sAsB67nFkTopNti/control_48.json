After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, waited a few days to decide, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is annoyed because he thinks they should have decided together.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. The author argues that she talked to her family first because they are mothers themselves and could offer support. Her boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making, which is understandable since it's their child. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially regarding big life events like pregnancy. However, the author's actions might be seen as her right to confide in her family first, especially since they are also mothers and could provide emotional support. But on the other hand, involving the partner in such a significant decision is also important. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be part of the process, which is valid. \n\nThe author does acknowledge his point, but she still feels her choice is valid. The question is whether her actions cross into being wrong. There's no clear right or wrong, but maybe the issue is more about communication and mutual respect. If she had told her boyfriend first, that might have addressed his concern. But since she didn't, and he's upset, maybe there's a lesson in considering the partner's perspective more. However, the answer might hinge on the cultural context or the specific relationship dynamics. In many cases, both partners should be involved in such decisions. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if the reasoning holds. Alternatively, maybe she's not in the wrong because it's her body and her choice, but the partner's feelings are also important. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because the decision affects both partners and should be made together.\n"
