After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before informing her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend, who was upset because she told her family first and made decisions without him.\n\nThe core issue here is about communication in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process since it's their child. The author justifies it by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, partners usually expect to be involved in major decisions, especially regarding a child. Even if the author was uncertain, involving her boyfriend earlier might have been better. However, the author's reasoning is that she needed time to process and her family could support her. \n\nBut pregnancy is a shared responsibility, so the boyfriend's perspective is valid. The author might have acted out of fear or hesitation, but not including him in the initial steps could be seen as not respecting his role. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong because she had her reasons and her decision to keep the baby was made later. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural and personal boundaries. If the couple had no prior agreements on such matters, the author might have misstepped. But if there were extenuating circumstances, like fear of his reaction, it complicates things. The boyfriend's annoyance is understandable, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, No. She had her reasons and made the decision after considering her family's input. While the boyfriend's feelings are valid, it doesn't automatically make her wrong.\n"
