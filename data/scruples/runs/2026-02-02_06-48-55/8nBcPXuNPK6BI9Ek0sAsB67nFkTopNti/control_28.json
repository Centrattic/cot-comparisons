After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thought they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user (AITA) is the one who made the decision to inform her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process. The key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship.\n\nThe author says she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think with her family. She then decided to keep the pregnancy. The boyfriend was initially supportive but was annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. The author argues that it's her body and her choice, and her family are mothers themselves, so they could provide support.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, when a couple is in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child are typically considered joint decisions. However, the author might have had her reasons for consulting her family first, possibly seeking emotional support or guidance from people she trusts who have experience with motherhood.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he feels excluded. The issue here is about communication. Even if she needed time to think, perhaps she should have included her partner in that process, even if only to talk about her feelings and concerns. The fact that she waited a few days and made decisions without him could be seen as not valuing his input, even if she didn't consult him directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not feel in the wrong because she took time to process her own feelings and sought support from her family before making a decision. The decision to have a child is a big one, and in some cases, individuals may prioritize their own emotional readiness and support systems.\n\nBut in a relationship, especially when it's a committed one, the expectation might be that both partners are involved in such major decisions. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from not being part of the initial decision-making process. It's possible that the author could have communicated her reasons for telling her family first and involved her boyfriend in the discussions later, even if she needed time to think.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author made a decision that was important to her and sought support from her family, which is understandable. However, not involving her partner in the decision-making process, even if it was to process her own feelings, might have been a misstep in terms of relationship communication. The key here is whether the boyfriend felt excluded, which he did. But whether that makes her in the wrong depends on cultural, personal, and relationship norms. In many cases, joint decisions are expected, so maybe there's a fault there. However, the author's actions were also about her own emotional process and seeking support from trusted family members. \n\nI think this is a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she made the decision considering her own needs and support system, even if the communication with her boyfriend wasn't optimal. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions, while perhaps not ideal from his perspective, don't necessarily make her at fault.\n"
