After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, and then her boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together. She argues that it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about whose responsibility it is to make the decision about the pregnancy. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's their child and they should have decided together. The author thinks it's her choice because it's her body. \n\nI need to consider both sides. In a relationship, major life decisions often require mutual agreement. A pregnancy definitely affects both partners. By telling her family first and making the decision without him, even if her family is supportive, it might have been better to involve her partner from the start. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. \n\nBut then again, she might have felt pressured or needed support from her family first. However, in a committed relationship, sharing such news with the partner first is usually expected. So maybe the author didn't handle it correctly by not involving her boyfriend immediately. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the relationship is such that they're a unit, then maybe she should have told him first. But if they're not in a place where they make decisions together, maybe not. The boyfriend's reaction suggests that he wanted to be part of the decision-making process. \n\nSo the answer might be A (in the wrong) because she made the decision without including him, which could be seen as not respecting his role in the relationship. However, others might say it's her body and her choice. But since it's a joint responsibility, maybe A is the answer here.\n"
