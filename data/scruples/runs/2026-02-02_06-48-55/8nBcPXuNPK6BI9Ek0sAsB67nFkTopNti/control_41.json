After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her family before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before telling her boyfriend. Then when she did tell him, he was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together. She argues that it's her choice and her family are mothers, so they could help. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing big news like a pregnancy with family is common. They are mothers, so their advice might be valuable. She did involve her family in discussions, which makes sense. But the boyfriend felt left out, which is a valid feeling. In a relationship, partners often expect to be part of major decisions affecting both. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether she was wrong. The question is about her actions. She didn't hide it from him forever; she did tell him eventually. He was upset about the order of information and the decision-making process. But pregnancy decisions involve the woman's body, so her autonomy is important. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she had her reasons and didn't intend to hurt him, but he felt excluded. It's more about communication and mutual respect. She might not be in the wrong, but maybe she should have discussed it with him first. However, considering the situation, her actions are understandable. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on improving communication. But the main point is her right to decide and seek support from her family. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but that doesn't mean she was wrong.\n"
