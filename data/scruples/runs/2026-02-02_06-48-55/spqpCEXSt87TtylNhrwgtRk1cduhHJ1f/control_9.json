I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really hard for her. She wears the headphones to cope with the noise and stress, especially when she's in stores. She shops at places with self-checkout to avoid needing to talk to people. Her friend mentioned that someone got upset because she ignored them when they tried to talk, which is why she's questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's using the headphones as a necessary coping mechanism due to her mental health conditions. It's important to recognize that she's not trying to be rude; she's managing her anxiety. She also mentioned that she shops at stores with self-checkout, which suggests she's trying to minimize interactions where possible. \n\nOn the other side, there's the perspective of the retail employees and others who might feel ignored. If someone approaches her to help, she might be missing that, which could lead to misunderstandings. However, the author didn't do this intentionally. She didn't know people were trying to talk to her, so it's not a case of being dismissive on purpose. \n\nThe key points here are intent and awareness. The author's actions are a result of her need to manage her anxiety, not a desire to be rude. She's also taking steps to avoid interactions where she can (like self-checkout). While she might unintentionally ignore someone trying to help, the fault isn't entirely hers. The situation is a conflict between her mental health needs and the expectations of social interactions. \n\nConsidering that, the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong. Her actions are a reasonable accommodation for her conditions. However, there might be a middle ground, like being aware of her surroundings or briefly checking if someone needs help. But given the context, she's not at fault here.\n"
