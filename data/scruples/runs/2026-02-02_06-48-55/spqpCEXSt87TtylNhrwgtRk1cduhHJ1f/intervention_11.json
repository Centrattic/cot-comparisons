I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 20-year-old with social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses headphones in public to manage sensory overload and social stress, especially when walking to work. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored her in the store, implying that the author might have done that, making her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for wearing headphones: mental health challenges that make social situations overwhelming. Using headphones can be a coping mechanism, and if she's in a store with self-checkout, maybe she's trying to minimize interactions. On the other hand, people in retail might feel disrespected if customers ignore them, even if unintentionally. The friend's coworker was hurt, which is a concern.\n\nBut the key here is intent. The author didn't mean to ignore anyone; she's using headphones to cope with her anxiety. The problem is the perception from the retail employees. Even though she didn't intend to be rude, her actions might cause that impression. However, the fact that she shops at stores with self-checkout suggests she's trying to avoid interactions where possible, which is a reasonable accommodation for her needs.\n\nThe question is whether her actions are considered asshole behavior. The AITA subreddit often considers both intent and the impact. Since her actions are a result of genuine mental health struggles and not an intentional disregard for others, it's more about needing understanding rather than being in the wrong. Plus, she's aware of the potential issue now and is seeking advice, showing she cares about others' feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because her actions stem from a need to manage her mental health, and she's taking steps to be considerate (using self-checkout). The conflict arises from differing perspectives, not malicious intent. The author isn't an asshole; she's someone with valid challenges who needs empathy.\n"
