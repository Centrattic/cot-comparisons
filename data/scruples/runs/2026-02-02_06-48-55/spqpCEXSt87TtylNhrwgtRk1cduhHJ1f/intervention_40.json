I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough for her. She got these nice headphones as a gift and uses them to cope in public places, especially when going to work. She uses them in stores to block out noise and avoid the stress of being around people. But her friend mentioned that someone at work was upset because she ignored them when entering the store. The friend's coworker even cried, thinking the author was an asshole for not acknowledging them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by wearing headphones in the store. On one hand, she has valid reasons related to her mental health. Her conditions make social interactions overwhelming, and the headphones help her manage that. It's understandable that she needs this coping mechanism to navigate daily tasks like shopping without getting too stressed. Also, she's trying to be considerate by choosing stores with self-checkout to minimize interactions, which shows she's aware of the social aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the store employees might feel disrespected or ignored when customers wear headphones and don't acknowledge them. Retail jobs can be tough, and employees might appreciate some basic courtesy, like eye contact or a smile. The author might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings by not noticing them when entering the store. The friend's coworker was upset, which suggests that this behavior can have a negative impact on others, even if it's not intentional.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's mental health needs are significant, and using headphones is a legitimate way to manage her anxiety. However, there's a social expectation to be somewhat aware of others in public spaces, especially when entering a store where employees might be greeting customers. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate or if there's a way to balance her needs with social norms.\n\nThe author mentions that she uses self-checkout to avoid interactions, which is a proactive step. However, when entering the store, if an employee is trying to greet or assist her, not acknowledging them could be seen as rude. But given her conditions, it's possible she's not aware of others' attempts to interact. It's a bit of a conflict between her personal coping mechanisms and the social expectations of the store environment.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer hinges on intent and awareness, then maybe not in the wrong. However, if the store employees felt disrespected, then there's a case for her being inconsiderate. But considering her mental health context, it's a complex situation. The author is trying to manage her well-being, which is important, but there's also a responsibility to be as courteous as possible in public interactions.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance. The author isn't maliciously ignoring people; she's doing her best to cope. The employees need to be understanding that some customers have anxiety or other conditions. Maybe the stores could have signage or more awareness about customers with such needs. So, while the author might not be in the wrong from her perspective, there's a need for both sides to show understanding. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication and awareness on both sides.\n"
