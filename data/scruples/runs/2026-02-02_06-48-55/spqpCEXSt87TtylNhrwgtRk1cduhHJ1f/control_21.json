I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public noise and social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. However, her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have made people feel ignored, but she needs the headphones to manage her anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. She has legitimate mental health issues that make social interactions stressful. Using headphones is a coping mechanism. It's not like she's being rude on purpose. The stores she goes to have self-checkouts, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. The problem arises if she's in a place where interaction is expected, but she's not there. But if she's just grabbing something and using self-checkout, maybe it's okay.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the perspective of others. If someone approaches her and she doesn't respond, they might feel ignored. But does she have a responsibility to remove her headphones if someone approaches? It's a tricky balance between her need for comfort and others' feelings. However, in many public places, people wear headphones and it's generally accepted unless they're in a service area where interaction is expected. Since she's using self-checkout, it's less likely she needs to interact. \n\nThe author's intention is clear: she's not trying to be an asshole. She's managing her mental health. The friend's coworker's reaction is valid, but maybe the author isn't at fault because she's not in a position where she's expected to engage. Retail employees might be used to people not making eye contact or being distracted. The key is whether her action of wearing headphones is a reasonable accommodation for her needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a necessary part of her coping strategies, and while it might inconvenience others occasionally, it's not her responsibility to always remove headphones in public spaces where she's not required to interact. The answer should be B.\n"
