I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public noise and social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact with employees. A friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones, leading the author to worry she might have upset people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. Her mental health conditions make social interactions stressful, and the headphones help her manage that. It's important to acknowledge that people with anxiety or autism might need accommodations. The author isn't intentionally being rude; she's using the headphones for a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, when someone enters a store wearing headphones, employees might expect some interaction, even if it's just a nod or a smile. Ignoring someone completely could be perceived as dismissive. However, the author isn't interacting with employees; she's just shopping and using self-checkout. The stores she frequents have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding interactions she needs to have. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author isn't trying to be an asshole; she's using the headphones to cope with her conditions. The employees who feel ignored might not know her situation. But does that mean she's in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. It's a balancing act between her need for comfort and others' expectations. \n\nAlso, the author mentions she's aware of the possibility of making others feel ignored and even apologized in her post. She's trying to be mindful. So, while her actions might cause unintentional hurt, her intentions are not malicious. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because her actions are driven by genuine need, not malice. Retail employees should be respectful too, understanding that customers have different reasons for their behaviors. The answer should be B (No).\n"
