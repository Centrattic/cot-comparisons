I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses headphones to cope with overwhelming environments and to have some peace during her walks. She's been shopping at a store with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker was upset because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have come off as an asshole by not engaging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. Her mental health conditions are valid reasons for seeking comfort through headphones. Public places can be stressful, and using headphones is a common coping mechanism. People with social anxiety often avoid eye contact or conversations to reduce anxiety, which isn't malicious. The author is also conscious of retail workers' tough jobs and even included a PS about being nice to them, so she's not intentionally being rude.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the perspective of the employees. Retail workers might expect some level of interaction, like a friendly greeting or acknowledgment. If someone walks in with headphones on and completely ignores them, it could be perceived as dismissive or arrogant. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable accommodation for her needs versus being considerate of others' feelings.\n\nBut the author is using self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. She's also not in the store to socialize, just to shop. The problem arises if employees feel ignored. However, in many stores, customers aren't obligated to engage with staff unless it's necessary for their transaction. Retail workers understand that not every customer wants to interact, but some might still take it personally.\n\nThe author's intention is to manage her mental health, which is a valid reason. The friend's coworker's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author's concern about unintentionally hurting someone shows she's empathetic. The question is whether wearing headphones in that context is inherently wrong. Since the author is not causing harm and is using the headphones for a legitimate reason, it's more about finding a balance between her needs and others' feelings. The stores she frequents have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary service. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
