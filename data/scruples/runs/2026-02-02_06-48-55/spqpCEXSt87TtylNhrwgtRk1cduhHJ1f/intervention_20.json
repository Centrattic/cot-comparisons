I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, and uses the headphones to cope with public spaces. They mention that they go to stores with self-checkout, so maybe they don't interact with staff.\n\nThe friend told them that someone at work cried because they were ignored when the author was in the store with headphones on. The author is worried they might have hurt someone's feelings by not noticing them. But they also feel that they need the headphones for their mental health.\n\nSo, am I the asshole (AITA)? The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider the author's reasons. They have a legitimate need for the headphones due to mental health issues. Using them in public is a coping mechanism, which is understandable. However, the friend's story suggests that not engaging with employees could be seen as rude or dismissive. \n\nBut the author isn't interacting with employees because they're using self-checkout. If they're avoiding manned registers, maybe they're not in situations where employees would expect interaction. However, maybe employees still approach them regardless. The author could have accidentally ignored someone who tried to help, leading to the employee feeling disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't intentionally being rude; they're dealing with anxiety. It's a balance between their mental health and the employees' feelings. Are they at fault for using a necessary coping mechanism, or is the responsibility on both sides to be understanding?\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is intent and impact. If the author didn't mean to hurt anyone but their actions had a negative impact, it's a gray area. However, since they are aware now, maybe they should adjust their behavior, like removing headphones when entering stores or using self-checkout to avoid interactions. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. The author's actions are unintentional, and they have a valid reason. However, the impact on the employees is real. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their intention isn't malicious, but they should be more mindful. However, some might argue that they are in the wrong for not considering the employees' feelings. \n\nI think the community often sides with people with mental health issues using necessary tools. So the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong, but they should be cautious.\n"
