I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism, which makes social interactions really hard for her. She got expensive headphones from her grandpa and uses them to cope with the stress of going to stores, especially since she shops at places with self-checkout.\n\nHer friend mentioned that someone cried because they were ignored when the author was in the store. The author is worried she might have made people feel like she's too important to talk to them. But she also needs the headphones to manage her anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has legitimate mental health issues that make social interactions overwhelming. Using headphones to cope isn't inherently wrong. On the other hand, retail employees often have to handle difficult customers and might feel disrespected if a customer ignores them. But she's using self-checkout, so maybe she's not even interacting with the staff. However, just entering the store and being present, even if she's not buying, might mean she's being approached by employees.\n\nThe question is whether her actions are inconsiderate. People do wear headphones in public for various reasons. But in a store where employees might expect to interact with customers, not being available to talk could be seen as rude. However, the author isn't refusing service; she's using self-checkout and just wants to minimize social interaction due to her conditions. There's a balance between personal comfort and respecting others' roles. Since she's not causing harm beyond possible perceived rudeness, and she's making efforts to be considerate by using self-checkout, maybe she's not in the wrong. The friend's coworker crying seems extreme, but the author might not have realized they were being approached. So the answer might be B, but need to check if her actions cross a line.\n"
