I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, so she uses headphones to cope with public noise and social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so maybe she's avoiding interacting with others. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might feel offended.\n\nHmm, the key points here are her mental health and the impact on others. The author has a valid reason for wearing headphones to manage her anxiety. Retail employees might feel disrespected if customers ignore them, but she didn't intend to ignore anyone. She was just trying to cope. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, maybe not. People have different needs. While it's considerate to be aware of others, she's not doing it maliciously. The stores she uses have self-checkout, so she's not forcing interaction. The problem is the perception others have, but she's not in the wrong if she's not violating store policies. The answer might be B, she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a balance? She could be mindful, like removing headphones if someone approaches, but she's not at fault for using them in the first place.\n"
