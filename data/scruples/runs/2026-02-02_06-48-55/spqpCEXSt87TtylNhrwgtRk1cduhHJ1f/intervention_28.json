I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. They have social anxiety and autism, use headphones to cope with noise and social interaction. They mention they only go to self-checkout stores, so maybe they avoid interacting with cashiers. A friend told them that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The person is worried they might have made people feel ignored, but also needs the headphones for their mental health.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has a valid reason for wearing headphones due to their health conditions. It's their way of managing stress in public. On the other hand, if employees feel ignored or disrespected when approached, that's a problem. The author might not have realized that employees expect some level of interaction or acknowledgment. But the key here is intent. The author isn't trying to be rude; they're using headphones for a necessary reason. However, they might need to be more mindful of others' feelings. Maybe a solution is to be aware of their surroundings or use a polite gesture when entering a store. But does that mean they're in the wrong? It's a balance between their needs and others' expectations. I think they're not in the wrong because their actions are driven by genuine health needs, but they could adjust their behavior slightly to avoid misunderstandings. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
