I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She wears headphones almost everywhere, including stores, to cope with noise and avoid overwhelming social interactions. She got the headphones as a gift from her grandpa and uses them in stores with self-checkout to make shopping less stressful. However, a friend mentioned that someone cried when they were ignored by someone wearing headphones, and the friend thinks people who do that are \"assholes.\" The author is now worried she might have made others feel ignored or important, even though she didn't mean to. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are her mental health conditions, the use of headphones as a coping mechanism, the stores she shops at have self-checkout, and the concern about inadvertently ignoring employees. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety and autism often use strategies to manage their interactions. Headphones can be a way to reduce sensory overload. It's reasonable that she uses them in public to cope.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's story suggests that someone was upset because they felt ignored. If the author was in a store where employees might expect some interaction (like asking for help), then walking in with headphones on could make it seem dismissive. However, she mentioned she shops at stores with self-checkout, which implies she doesn't need to interact with employees. That's probably why she feels comfortable there.\n\nBut maybe there are situations where an employee might approach her, even in a self-checkout store, and she might miss that. If someone tried to interact and she didn't respond, that could be hurtful. However, the author didn't intend to ignore anyone; she just uses headphones to manage her anxiety. There's a difference between intent and the impact.\n\nThe friend's coworker crying is an extreme reaction, but it's one example. The author's actions might unintentionally affect others, but is that her fault? She's making a choice that benefits her mental health. However, maybe there's a balance between her needs and considering others. Perhaps she could be more aware of her surroundings or remove headphones when necessary, but given her conditions, that might be challenging.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often wear headphones in public. For example, in many places, it's common to wear headphones in stores unless interaction is needed. Retail employees might prefer customers not to have them on if assistance is required, but in self-checkout stores, interaction is minimized. So, the author isn't necessarily doing something wrong by the store's rules.\n\nThe question is about whether she's an asshole. The term \"asshole\" implies intentional disregard. Since she didn't mean to ignore anyone and has valid reasons for wearing headphones, it's more about her coping mechanisms than being inconsiderate. However, the impact on others is real. But given her circumstances, she's trying to manage her mental health, which is a legitimate need.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's using headphones to cope with her conditions, which are valid reasons. While her actions might inadvertently hurt someone, it's not intentional, and she's making a conscious effort to manage her anxiety. The answer should be B (No).\n"
