I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wearing headphones in a store. They have social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism, which I know can make social interactions really tough. They wear the headphones to cope with public noise and stress, especially in stores. Their friend mentioned that a coworker was hurt when someone ignored them by having headphones on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons for wearing headphones. They're using them as a necessary coping mechanism for their mental health. It's important to recognize that people with anxiety or autism might need these tools to function in public spaces. Stores can be overwhelming, and using headphones to manage sensory overload is a common strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, when someone enters a store where they might interact with employees, not being available for communication could be seen as rude. Retail employees often rely on customer interactions, and if someone is completely zoned out, it might make the employee feel ignored or disrespected. The friend's coworker crying over being ignored is a significant point. Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, their actions could unintentionally cause hurt feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't trying to be rude. They\u2019re using the headphones for a legitimate reason. They also only go to stores with self-checkout, which suggests they\u2019re trying to minimize interaction. However, even if they avoid talking to employees, other customers might approach them. The problem here is the potential for misunderstanding. The author isn't aware of social cues if they're wearing headphones, so they might accidentally ignore someone trying to engage them.\n\nIs it the author's fault? They have a valid need, but maybe they could be more mindful. For example, adjusting headphones when entering a store to signal they still want to interact, or being aware that their presence might affect others. However, given their mental health conditions, expecting them to change their behavior entirely might be difficult. It's a balance between their needs and the social expectations of public spaces.\n\nIn terms of whether they're the asshole, maybe not entirely. The author isn't malicious. They\u2019re trying to cope with their conditions. However, they should consider the impact on others and perhaps find a middle ground. For instance, maybe they can still wear headphones but be more aware of their surroundings or use a different method when entering a store to signal they\u2019re not available for conversation. The key is that their intention isn't to be rude, but the effect on others is real.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their actions stem from a genuine need for mental health support, but they might need to adjust slightly to prevent misunderstandings. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives are valid. The author isn't intentionally being an asshole, so they're not the asshole in this scenario.\n"
