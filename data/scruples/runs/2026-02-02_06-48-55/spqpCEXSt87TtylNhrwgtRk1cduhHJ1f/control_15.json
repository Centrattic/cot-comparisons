I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about her wearing headphones in stores and possibly ignoring people. She has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions hard for her. She uses the headphones to cope with the sensory overload and to have a buffer against unwanted social interactions. \n\nThe key points here are her mental health conditions and her intention versus the potential effect on others. She mentions that she's not trying to be rude; she's actually using the headphones as a necessary tool to manage her anxiety. However, her friend's coworker was hurt by being ignored. The author acknowledges that she might have done this to others, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, people often wear headphones in public to listen to music, podcasts, etc. It's a common practice. The issue arises if someone expects you to engage with them. In retail settings, employees might approach customers to help them, and if the customer is zoned out, it could be confusing or hurtful. However, the author is also using the headphones for a valid reason related to her mental health. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). She's not in the wrong because she's using the headphones to cope with her conditions, which are legitimate and challenging. While she might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings, her actions aren't malicious. It's a balance between her needs and social norms. Maybe she could consider a compromise, like being aware of her surroundings in stores where interactions are likely, but that doesn't make her wrong in this situation.\n"
