I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety and high-functioning autism. She wears headphones to cope with noisy environments and to avoid social interactions that overwhelm her. She uses them when going to stores that have self-checkout, which she mentions is a way to make shopping less stressful. However, a friend told her that a coworker cried because someone ignored them, implying that the author might be seen as rude or an asshole for not engaging. The author is now worried that she might have ignored people who wanted to speak to her, even though she didn't intend to be dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. Her mental health conditions are valid and recognized. Using headphones to manage anxiety and sensory overload is a common coping mechanism. People with social anxiety or autism often find that such strategies help them navigate social situations. The author is using the headphones to maintain her own mental well-being, which is understandable and necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the perspective of the retail employees. If someone walks into a store with headphones on, it can be misinterpreted as being dismissive or not wanting to interact. In retail, employees often need to assist customers, and if a customer appears disengaged, it might be hard for the employee to approach or offer help. The friend's coworker felt ignored, which is a real concern. However, the author didn't intend to ignore anyone; she was zoning out to manage her anxiety. There's a difference between intentional disregard and unintentional disengagement due to mental health needs.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's using the headphones for a legitimate reason and isn't actively ignoring people (like refusing help when offered), then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if her actions inadvertently cause others to feel ignored, there might be a need for a balance between her needs and the expectations of others. \n\nBut considering that she's using self-checkout, which implies she doesn't need assistance, perhaps the likelihood of needing to interact is lower. Still, unexpected interactions could still occur. The key here is whether she's being considerate in her approach. For instance, maybe she could be more aware of her surroundings if someone approaches her, but since she's dealing with anxiety, it's a bit of a tricky situation.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's common to wear headphones in public, in certain contexts like retail, it might be seen as impolite. However, given her mental health conditions, she has a valid reason. The author isn't doing it to be rude, but to cope. So, it's a matter of balancing her needs with the potential impact on others. The fact that she acknowledges her friend's concern and is reflecting on her actions shows self-awareness, which is important.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be misinterpreted by others, her intentions are rooted in managing her mental health. She's not in the wrong for using a necessary coping mechanism. However, she might need to be mindful of her environment and consider ways to signal openness to assistance if needed, such as carrying a note or being attentive to people approaching her. But fundamentally, her use of headphones in this context isn't malicious, so she's not the asshole.\n"
