I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really hard for them. They got high-end headphones as a gift and use them to cope in public spaces, especially when going to stores. They only shop at places with self-checkout, so they don't have to interact with employees much. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker was upset because someone ignored them when they walked into the store wearing headphones. The author is worried they might have ignored people, making those employees feel disrespected, but they also need the headphones to feel comfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions overwhelming and use coping mechanisms like headphones. It's important to recognize that their use of headphones is a way to manage their mental health, not out of arrogance. On the other hand, retail employees might feel disrespected if a customer ignores them, especially if they were trying to help or greet the customer. However, the author mentions they only use self-checkout, so they might not be expecting interaction. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are intentionally ignoring others or if it's an unintentional consequence of their need for coping mechanisms. The author isn't trying to be rude; they're trying to cope with their anxiety. The employees might not be aware of the author's condition, and while it's possible they felt ignored, the author's intention wasn't to be an asshole. The author is also showing awareness and concern after hearing about the coworker's experience, which suggests they aren't indifferent.\n\nRetail workers do have tough jobs and deserve respect, but the author's situation is a legitimate need for accommodation. It's a balance between the customer's right to use personal space and the employee's need to provide service. Since the author uses self-checkout, the interaction is minimized, but there might be instances where an employee approaches. The author isn't in the wrong because they're using a valid coping method and aren't intentionally being rude. The answer should reflect that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
