I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to cope, especially in noisy environments. Her grandpa gave her the Beats headphones as a Christmas gift, and she wants to use them as much as possible.\n\nShe's been going into stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction, which helps her manage her anxiety. But her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have come off as arrogant or inconsiderate, even though she didn't mean to. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one side, people with social anxiety or autism might need accommodations to function in public spaces. The stores she goes to have self-checkout, so she can avoid interaction, which is reasonable. On the other hand, if someone tries to interact with her (like a retail employee) and she's zoned out, that person might feel ignored or disrespected. \n\nBut the key points here are that she's using the headphones to manage her mental health, she's not in a store that requires interaction, and she's aware of the potential issue now. The stores she goes to don't require human interaction, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. However, if someone approaches her and she's wearing headphones, it might be awkward. \n\nBut the scenario mentions that she uses self-checkout stores, so maybe there's no need for interaction. The coworker crying was probably because someone approached her and she didn't respond. But if the author isn't at that specific store, maybe the main issue is the general behavior. \n\nConsidering her mental health needs and the fact that she's using the headphones to cope in a way that doesn't interfere with necessary interactions (since she uses self-checkout), she's not in the wrong. The answer is B (No). Also, the PS shows she's considerate of retail workers, which adds to her not being an asshole.\n"
