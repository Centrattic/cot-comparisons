I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has severe social anxiety and depression, and high-functioning autism. These are valid mental health conditions that can make social interactions really challenging. She mentioned she was bullied as a kid, which probably exacerbates her anxiety. So, her motivation for wearing headphones is to manage her mental health in public, noisy environments. That makes sense. Using headphones to block out stimuli can be a coping strategy for people with social anxiety or ASD.\n\nShe got the headphones as a gift from her grandpa, and she's using them to make her commute and shopping trips more bearable. She sticks to stores with self-checkout to avoid interactions, which is a reasonable approach if she's trying to minimize stress. The issue arises when she enters the store and employees might feel ignored. Her friend told her about a coworker who was upset because a customer didn't acknowledge them, making the coworker feel dismissed.\n\nThe key question here is whether her actions are inconsiderate. On one hand, she's using the headphones to manage her mental health, which is a legitimate need. On the other, employees might feel that being ignored is rude. But does that make her the asshole? I think it's a balance between her right to manage her anxiety and the employees' feelings. \n\nPeople in retail often have to deal with various customer behaviors, and while it's understandable that an employee might feel hurt if someone ignores them, it's also important to recognize that some customers have valid reasons for not engaging. The author isn't intentionally being rude; she's trying to cope with her anxiety. Plus, she's aware of the potential issue and is seeking advice, which shows she's considerate and willing to reflect. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that using self-checkout might be part of the solution. Maybe she could adjust her behavior by removing headphones when entering the store or using non-ear covering headphones to show she's open to communication. But fundamentally, her actions stem from a place of need rather than malice. Retail jobs are tough, but so is living with social anxiety and autism. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her intentions are good, and she's not deliberately being inconsiderate. It's a communication issue rather than an intentional slight. The employees might need to understand that not all customers ignore them intentionally. The author is trying to find a balance here, and she's already taking steps to minimize interactions by using self-checkout. Her awareness and willingness to adjust (as mentioned in the PS) show she's not an asshole.\n"
