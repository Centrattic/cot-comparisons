I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an asshole for wearing headphones in stores. They have social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions tough for them. They wear the headphones to cope with noise and avoid stress. Their grandpa gave them the headphones as a Christmas gift, so they really value them.\n\nThe key points here are their mental health conditions and the reason for wearing headphones. They mention that they only go to stores with self-checkout, so maybe they don't interact with employees much. However, a friend mentioned that others might feel ignored or disrespected when approached by someone with headphones on. The person is worried they might have offended people without realizing it.\n\nOn one hand, using headphones is a common way people manage sensory overload or anxiety. It's a personal coping mechanism, and they're not intentionally being rude. On the other hand, when someone approaches you in a store expecting a conversation, not acknowledging them could be perceived as dismissive. But the author isn't trying to be an asshole; they're managing their mental health needs.\n\nThe question is whether their actions are wrong. If they're not interacting with employees and using self-checkout, maybe the employees they're ignoring are not expecting a conversation. However, there's still a possibility of others approaching them. The key is intent. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to cope with anxiety. The problem is the potential impact on others. But since the author isn't aware and is using the headphones for a valid reason, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a balance between their needs and others' feelings. The community often sides with people who have legitimate health issues. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
