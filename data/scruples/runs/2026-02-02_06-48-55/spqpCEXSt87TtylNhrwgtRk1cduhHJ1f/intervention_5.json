I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with noise and social interactions. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might see her as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has valid reasons for needing the headphones due to her mental health conditions. Public places can be overwhelming for her, and using headphones helps manage that. However, the issue arises when she enters a store and might be ignoring employees who want to interact, which could make them feel disrespected or neglected.\n\nOn one hand, her mental health is a legitimate reason. People should be understanding of others' need for personal space or coping mechanisms. On the other hand, retail employees might rely on customers engaging with them for assistance, and not responding could be seen as rude, even if unintentional. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author isn't trying to be rude; she's using the headphones for necessary coping. But the impact on others is real\u2014employees might feel ignored or devalued. However, the author is making an effort to shop in stores with self-checkout, which suggests she's trying to minimize interactions without needing help. \n\nIt's a balance between her needs and others' feelings. Since she's not intentionally ignoring people and has a valid reason, maybe she's not in the wrong. But she could consider situations where an employee might need to help her, so maybe there's a middle ground. However, given the circumstances, her actions are more about self-care, and the negative impact isn't malicious. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
