I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, autism, and depression. She uses the headphones to cope with public places, especially during her walk to work. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so maybe she avoids interactions. Her friend mentioned that someone got upset when she zoned them out.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether she's being an asshole. On one hand, she has a valid reason for needing the headphones due to her mental health conditions. That's a legitimate need. But on the other hand, there's the social aspect\u2014people might expect a greeting or acknowledgment. The friend's coworker cried because someone ignored them, which is a strong reaction. The author might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings by not engaging, even if that's not her intention.\n\nBut, considering her circumstances, she's managing her own mental health. Retail workers often deal with difficult customers, and maybe expecting someone to engage in small talk is unreasonable. However, in some cultures or settings, a simple acknowledgment is expected. The key here is whether her actions were dismissive. If she's using headphones to avoid interactions that aren't necessary (like at self-checkout), maybe it's acceptable. But if she's entering a store and not acknowledging employees, it might come off as rude, especially if someone approaches her.\n\nBut the author didn't mention avoiding employees entirely. She just wears headphones and zones out. It's possible that people might approach her expecting a greeting. The problem arises when she's in a position where interaction is expected, and she avoids it, making others feel ignored. However, given her mental health issues, is that her fault? She's using a coping mechanism. The question is about whether she's the asshole, not about what the employees or others should do. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her actions are considered rude despite her reasons. Some might argue she's not in the wrong because she's managing her needs. Others might say that ignoring people, even unintentionally, is disrespectful. But the author is also making an effort to be considerate by choosing self-checkout. The friend's coworker's reaction is extreme, but it's a real impact. So, maybe the answer is a balance. But according to the options, it's A or B. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure. I think the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's using necessary coping strategies for her health, and stores with self-checkout are designed to minimize interaction. The employees can't force interaction if she's not their customer. However, if she's in a store where employees expect engagement (like a service-oriented store), but the author picks places with self-checkout to avoid that. So in this context, she's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
