I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about wearing headphones in a store and whether that's considered rude or not. The author has severe social anxiety and autism, so she uses headphones to cope with public spaces. She mentions that she only goes to stores with self-checkout, probably to avoid interaction. Her friend hears a coworker crying because someone ignored them by using headphones, and the author is now worried she might have done the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is common for some. But the issue here is the impact on others. If a retail employee tries to help and the customer ignores them because they're in their own world with headphones, that's probably not good. The author might have unintentionally hurt someone's feelings by not acknowledging them.\n\nHowever, the author isn't being intentionally rude. She's trying to manage her anxiety. The stores she goes to have self-checkout, so maybe she's aware of that and avoids places where interaction is necessary. Still, if an employee approaches her for assistance or greeting, not acknowledging them could be seen as dismissive. The key point is whether she's being considerate. Maybe she should remove her headphones when entering a store to be polite, especially if someone needs to talk to her. But if she's just grabbing something and using self-checkout, maybe it's less of an issue. \n\nIt's a balance between her need for comfort and others' feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not aware people might need to talk to her, maybe she's not at fault. But if she's entering a store daily and repeatedly zoned out, she might have ignored people who wanted to interact. The friend's coworker crying suggests that the action had a negative impact. However, the author's intention isn't to be an asshole; she's trying to cope. \n\nI think the answer is not a clear yes or no. But the system wants A or B. If the author is not in the wrong because of her medical conditions and the stores she chooses with self-checkout, then B. If her actions, even unintentional, hurt others and she should make an effort to be more considerate, then A. Maybe the right approach is to suggest she removes headphones when necessary, but technically, she's not in the wrong because she's managing her mental health. Hmm.\n"
