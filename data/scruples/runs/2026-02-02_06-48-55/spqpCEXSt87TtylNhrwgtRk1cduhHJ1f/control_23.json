I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses headphones to cope with public places, especially during her long walk to work. Her grandpa gave her expensive headphones, and she uses them everywhere, including stores. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. A friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored her at the store, implying that people might think the author is an asshole for not engaging. The author is now worried she's been ignoring people and making them feel bad, but also feels she needs the headphones for her mental health.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, she has valid reasons for needing the headphones due to her mental health conditions. Public places are overwhelming, and using headphones helps her manage that. She's also using self-checkout, so maybe she's trying to minimize interaction as much as possible. On the other hand, when she enters a store, others might expect some level of interaction, like a greeting or acknowledgment. If she's completely zoned out with headphones on, it might come off as dismissive or rude, even if unintentional.\n\nBut here's the thing: people have different needs. Retail workers might want to be acknowledged, but shouldn't the customer's need to manage their mental health also be considered? It's a balance. However, the key point is that she's aware now that her actions might be hurting others. The author is reflecting on this and is concerned about the impact on others, which shows she's trying to be considerate.\n\nAlso, the stores she shops at have self-checkout, so maybe she's choosing places where interaction is minimized. But even in those stores, there might be staff she encounters (like a greeter or someone at the entrance). The friend's story suggests that someone felt ignored, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, there's no wrong, but socially, it's more about perception. The answer depends on whether her actions are considered rude or not. However, given her mental health challenges and her intention to avoid stress, it's a matter of empathy. She's trying to manage her own well-being, which is important. At the same time, if she can make a small effort to acknowledge others (like a nod or a smile), it might help both her and the others. But the problem isn't that she's using headphones; it's the potential for others to feel ignored. Since she's now aware, maybe the solution is to adjust her approach slightly rather than being in the wrong entirely.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her actions stem from genuine mental health needs, and while she can be mindful to acknowledge others if possible, she's not intentionally being rude. The main issue is the social expectation versus her need for coping strategies.\n"
