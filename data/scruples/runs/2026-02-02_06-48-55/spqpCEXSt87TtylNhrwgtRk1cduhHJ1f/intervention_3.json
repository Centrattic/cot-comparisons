I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nThe author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses headphones to cope with public spaces and noisy environments. She mentions that she only shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. A friend told her that someone cried because she ignored them, so she's worried she came off as an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, people in retail might appreciate being acknowledged, and ignoring them could be hurtful. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not interacting. She's not trying to be rude, just trying to manage her mental health. There's a balance between respecting others' need for social interaction and her need for coping mechanisms.\n\nRetail employees often deal with a lot, and not all customers will be polite. The author isn't deliberately ignoring people; she's using headphones to cope. However, maybe she could be more aware of her surroundings or make an effort to nod or smile if someone approaches her. The key here is intent vs. impact. Her intent is to manage her anxiety, but the impact might be negative on others.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she's not doing it with malicious intent, maybe not. People have different needs, and society should be more accommodating towards those with disabilities. However, there's a social expectation to acknowledge others in shared spaces. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but perhaps could be more considerate. The question is asking if she's in the wrong, not if she's perfect. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions are a result of her mental health conditions and she's trying to cope, not being intentionally rude.\n"
