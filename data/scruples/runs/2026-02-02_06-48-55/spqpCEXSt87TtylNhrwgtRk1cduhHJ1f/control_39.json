I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about wearing headphones in stores, which is a common thing but can be seen as rude sometimes.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author has severe social anxiety and depression, plus high functioning autism. These conditions make social interactions really tough. She gets headphones as a gift and uses them to cope in public places, which helps her manage stress. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she's not interacting with employees, but she's worried she's ignoring people who might want to talk to her, like the coworker who cried because someone didn't engage.\n\nThe friend's comment makes her realize she might have come off as an asshole. The question is whether she's actually in the wrong. \n\nOn one side, people in retail often have to deal with a lot, and being ignored by customers could be frustrating. Employees might expect some basic level of interaction, even if it's just a nod or a greeting. If customers are wearing headphones and completely tuning out, it could make employees feel disrespected or undervalued, especially since they're already in a high-stress job.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons for using headphones. It's a coping mechanism for her mental health. She's not trying to be rude; she's managing her anxiety. People with social anxiety or autism might find it necessary to use such strategies to function in public. Also, since she uses self-checkout, maybe the intention is to avoid interactions where possible, which is understandable.\n\nThe key here is intent. The author isn't being intentionally dismissive; she's trying to cope with her conditions. However, the impact of her actions is that she might be making employees feel ignored. It's a conflict between her need for comfort and the employees' feelings. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If she's not aware of people approaching her, maybe she should be more mindful. But given her conditions, expecting her to interact might be unrealistic. Also, the stores she goes to have self-checkout options, which suggests she's choosing a path that minimizes interaction, not forcing it. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on whether the action was intentional and if there's a reasonable alternative. Since she's using headphones for a valid reason and choosing self-checkout, it's more about her mental health needs. Retail employees having to deal with customers who are disengaged is a workplace issue, but the author isn't actively trying to be rude. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole) because her actions are a necessary accommodation for her mental health, and there's a way to shop without interacting (self-checkout), so she's not being intentionally dismissive. The employees might need to understand that some customers have difficulties, but the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
