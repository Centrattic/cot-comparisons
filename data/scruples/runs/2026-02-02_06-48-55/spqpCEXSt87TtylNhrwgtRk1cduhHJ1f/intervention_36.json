I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wearing headphones in the store. They have social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions tough. They use the headphones to cope with noise and avoid social stress. They shop at self-checkout stores, so they don't interact much. A friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them, and others think it's rude to not talk. The author is worried they might have hurt someone's feelings, but they also need the headphones for their well-being.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has valid reasons for wearing headphones due to mental health conditions. Their intention is to manage their anxiety, not to be rude. However, some people might find it offensive because they feel ignored if approached. But at the same time, everyone has the right to their personal space and comfort. The stores they use have self-checkout, implying they don't expect interaction. The author is also considerate of retail workers, acknowledging their tough job.\n\nThe question is whether their actions are inconsiderate. The answer might depend on context. Since they're using headphones in a setting where interaction isn't necessary, maybe it's not their fault. But there's a social norm that when entering a store, you might be expected to engage politely, like saying hello or being approachable. However, given their health conditions, it's a personal coping mechanism. It's a balance between personal needs and social expectations. The friend's coworker's reaction is an example of how others perceive it, but the author isn't intentionally being rude. So maybe the answer is B (they're not in the wrong) because their actions are driven by necessity and not malice, even if some might take it the wrong way.\n"
