I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wearing headphones in stores. They have social anxiety, autism, and depression, which makes public interactions hard. They got the headphones as a gift to cope with the stress of walking to work and using them in stores to block out noise. Their friend mentioned that someone cried because they were ignored, and they worried they might have made others feel snubbed.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, they have legitimate reasons for needing the headphones. Their mental health is a valid factor here. People with social anxiety might find it necessary to use such tools to function in public spaces. It's understandable that they want to avoid distress and manage their sensory input.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the retail employee's perspective. If someone approaches them for help and the customer is zoned out, it could come off as dismissive or rude. The employee might feel ignored, especially if they're trying to assist. The author mentions they shop at stores with self-checkout, which might mean they don't need help, but maybe others assumed they did. \n\nBut the key here is intent. The author isn't being intentionally rude; they're using the headphones for their well-being. They didn't mean to ignore anyone. The problem is more about miscommunication or differing expectations. Retail environments can be busy, and employees might not always know if someone needs help. However, the customer's need to manage their anxiety is also important.\n\nIn many public places, wearing headphones is common. People do it for various reasons\u2014music, podcasts, or just blocking out noise. It's generally not considered rude unless someone is directly engaging you and you're ignoring them. The author might not have been aware that someone was trying to interact, so it's more about accidental neglect rather than intentional rudeness.\n\nThe author should maybe be more mindful in situations where interaction is likely. For example, in a retail store, if they're browsing and someone approaches, they could acknowledge the employee first before zoning out. But overall, using headphones for mental health reasons isn't inherently wrong. The employees can also be proactive in offering assistance if needed.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B\u2014they're not in the wrong. Their actions come from a place of needing to cope with their conditions, and they aren't intentionally being dismissive. It's a situation where both sides can adjust: the customer uses headphones for their well-being, and employees can offer help if needed without assuming rudeness.\n"
