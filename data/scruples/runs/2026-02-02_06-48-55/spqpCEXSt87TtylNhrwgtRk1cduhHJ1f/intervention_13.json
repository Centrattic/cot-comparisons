I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes her avoid social interactions. She got high-end headphones as a gift and uses them to cope in public places, especially in stores she visits for self-checkouts. She's aware that people might feel ignored if they try to talk to her while she's wearing them.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone didn't respond. The author is worried she might have hurt someone's feelings by not acknowledging them. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. On one hand, she has valid reasons for needing the headphones for her mental health. Public places are stressful, and using headphones is a common coping mechanism. On the other hand, if someone approaches her to engage in a social interaction and she's too absorbed in her music, that could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. Retail employees might feel disrespected if customers ignore them, especially if they're trying to help or make small talk as part of their job.\n\nBut the key points are: the author uses self-checkout stores, so maybe she's not expecting direct interaction. She's not avoiding interactions that she's supposed to have, like with customer service. Also, she's not being intentionally rude; it's more about her personal need. However, the fact that she was in the same store daily and might have ignored people who wanted to talk to her could be the issue.\n\nI think it's a balance. She's not in the wrong for needing accommodations for her mental health. However, maybe she could be more considerate of others. Perhaps she could remove her headphones a bit when entering the store, just in case someone needs to interact. But given her anxiety, that might be challenging. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong because her actions are a necessary coping mechanism, and the stores she uses don't require direct interaction. The friend's coworker might have had a different expectation, but the author isn't obligated to engage in unwanted social interactions. So the answer is probably B.\n"
