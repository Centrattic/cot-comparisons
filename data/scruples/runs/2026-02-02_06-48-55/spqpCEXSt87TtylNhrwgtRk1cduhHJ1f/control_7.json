I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety and high functioning autism, which makes social interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to cope in noisy environments and to avoid overwhelming situations. Her grandpa gave her the expensive headphones, so she wants to use them as much as possible. She shops at stores with self-checkout to minimize interaction. \n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is concerned she might have been seen as an asshole for not engaging, even though she didn't mean to. The key points here are her mental health conditions, the intent behind using headphones, and the impact on others.\n\nOn one hand, people with social anxiety or autism might need these coping mechanisms. It's important to accommodate their needs. On the other hand, ignoring employees could be seen as rude, especially if the employee tried to engage. However, the author isn't avoiding conversations out of arrogance but due to genuine discomfort. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. \n\nThe question is whether her actions are inconsiderate. The author isn't being intentionally dismissive; she's managing her mental health. The employees might feel disrespected, but the author's intention isn't to be an asshole. The answer likely hinges on understanding her circumstances versus the employees' feelings. Since she's not engaging in harmful behavior and is using the headphones for a valid reason, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. However, there's a balance between her needs and being considerate. Maybe she could acknowledge employees if approached, but just wearing headphones isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
