I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wearing headphones in a store. They have social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. They use the headphones to manage that stress. The problem came up because a friend mentioned that someone was upset when the author didn't acknowledge them in the store. The author is worried they looked arrogant or dismissive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid reason for wearing headphones, especially given their mental health. On the other hand, maybe not being aware of others' needs to interact could be an issue. The stores they go to have self-checkout, so maybe they're not in situations where interaction is necessary. But when someone does try to talk, the author's presence with headphones might come off as ignoring them.\n\nBut the author didn't intend to ignore anyone. They just needed the headphones for their own well-being. Retail employees might feel it's part of their job to assist, so the customer not engaging could make them feel undervalued. However, the author isn't refusing service when given a chance to interact. They're just avoiding unnecessary conversation.\n\nI think it's a balance. The author has a legitimate need, but maybe they should consider the perspective of others. Perhaps using a smaller signifier, like earbuds instead of large headphones, or being more aware of their environment. But overall, they aren't intentionally being rude. They might not be the asshole, but there's room for adjustment. The key is whether their actions are malicious, which they aren't. So answer B.\n"
