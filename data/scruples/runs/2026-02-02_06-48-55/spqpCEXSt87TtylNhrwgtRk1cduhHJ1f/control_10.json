I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public noise and avoid overwhelming social interactions. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. Her friend mentioned that a coworker was upset when she ignored them, leading to the question if she's an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning seems valid. She has legitimate reasons for using the headphones, which help her manage her mental health. It's important to consider that people with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions extremely stressful. Using headphones in public is a common coping mechanism for many people, not just those with conditions. \n\nHowever, there's the social aspect. When entering a store, especially a retail environment, there's an implicit expectation that employees might need to assist you. If someone is wearing headphones, it could make an employee feel ignored if they try to interact. The author mentions that she was unaware of someone wanting to talk to her, which adds to the complexity. \n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't intend to ignore anyone; she was using the headphones for her own well-being. The impact on others is that some might feel ignored or disrespected. However, the author is also managing her mental health, which is a valid and important consideration. \n\nRetail workers often deal with difficult customers, and not all interactions are about the customer's responsibility. The author's PS also shows she's aware of the challenges retail workers face, which is a positive point. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't malicious, the situation creates a conflict between her need for comfort and the potential discomfort of others. The answer might depend on cultural norms and individual perspectives. However, given the context of her mental health and the fact that she uses self-checkout to minimize interaction, it's more about balancing personal needs with social etiquette, not outright being in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
