I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old with severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She gets expensive headphones for Christmas and uses them to manage her anxiety in public places. She wears them in stores where she shops, especially those with self-checkout. A friend mentions that a coworker cried because someone ignored them, and the author is worried she might have done that. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism often use coping mechanisms like headphones to filter out sensory overload and reduce stress. Her use of headphones seems to be a necessary part of her routine to function in public spaces, which are inherently stressful for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's perspective is important too. If someone approaches her in the store expecting a conversation and she's unresponsive due to headphones, that could be perceived as dismissive or rude. However, the author didn't intentionally ignore anyone; she might not have been aware of the interaction. It's a conflict between her need for sensory comfort and others' expectations of social engagement.\n\nThe key here is whether her actions were intentional. Since she wears headphones to manage her anxiety and uses self-checkout to avoid interaction, it's likely she wasn't trying to ignore people. However, the potential impact on others is real. The author is acknowledging this and is seeking advice, which shows she's considering others' feelings.\n\nIn similar situations, people with disabilities or mental health issues are often given some leeway, as their actions are part of necessary accommodations. The stores she's shopping at might even have a policy of allowing headphones if they don't affect others. But the issue arises if her presence causes distress to employees. However, the employee in question might have different expectations about customer interaction.\n\nThe answer hinges on balancing her right to manage her mental health with the reasonable expectations of others. Since she's not engaging in behavior that endangers or hinders others (like loud music or blocking aisles) and is using self-checkout to avoid needing help, it's more about her personal coping strategy. The coworker's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author isn't intentionally being dismissive. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
