I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, autism, and depression, which makes public interactions stressful. She got the headphones as a Christmas gift and uses them to cope in noisy environments. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. But a friend mentioned that someone cried because she was ignored, and others might feel she's an \"asshole\" for not engaging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find public interactions overwhelming. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a reasonable way to manage their condition. It's important to be understanding of mental health challenges. On the other hand, the store employees might feel disrespected or ignored if they try to engage her. But since she uses self-checkout, maybe she's not avoiding necessary interactions. The key is whether she's being inconsiderate on purpose. She's not ignoring people intentionally but using the headphones to cope. Also, she acknowledges the possibility of hurting someone's feelings and is reflecting on it. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her actions are for managing her health, and she's not intentionally being rude. Retail employees should be respected, but her use of headphones is a personal need. However, maybe she could be more mindful, like removing headphones when interacting. But overall, her intentions aren't malicious.\n"
