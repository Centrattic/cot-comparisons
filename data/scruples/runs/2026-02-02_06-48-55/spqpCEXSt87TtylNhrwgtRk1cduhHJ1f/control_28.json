I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public spaces and stressful situations like shopping. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction, which she mentions isn't a problem. However, a friend's coworker cried because someone ignored them when entering the store. The author is worried she might have come off as an asshole by not engaging, even though she didn't intend to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has valid reasons for wearing headphones\u2014mental health issues that make social interactions overwhelming. Using coping mechanisms like headphones is common for people with similar conditions. The key issue here is whether not engaging with employees is considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nOn one hand, in many cultures, it's generally expected to at least acknowledge someone, especially in customer service roles. If an employee tries to interact and the customer is completely disengaged, it could be seen as dismissive. However, the author isn't ignoring them on purpose to be rude; she's using the headphones to manage her anxiety. She also mentioned she uses self-checkout to minimize interaction, which suggests she's aware of the potential for conflict and is trying to avoid it.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are wrong. The answer depends on balancing the employee's need for interaction (as part of their job) and the customer's need for a coping mechanism. Since the author isn't actively being rude\u2014just avoiding interaction due to a legitimate health condition\u2014it's more about perspective. The employee might feel ignored, but the author has a valid reason. The key is intent: the author isn't trying to be an asshole, just trying to cope. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, but she could considerate alternatives, like removing the headphones briefly if someone approaches. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about possible improvements. So the answer likely is B (No), because her actions stem from a need to manage her health, not from malice.\n"
