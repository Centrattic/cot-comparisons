I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, uses headphones to cope with public spaces, and shops at stores with self-checkout. A friend mentioned that someone cried because the author ignored them, leading to the question of whether the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's mental health. They have valid reasons for needing to use headphones to manage their anxiety. Public places can be overwhelming, especially for someone with social anxiety and autism. The headphones are a necessary tool for them to function comfortably in such environments.\n\nOn the other hand, the author shops at a store where employees might expect interaction. Retail workers often have to deal with customers, and if a customer comes in with headphones on, it might be perceived as not wanting to engage, even if that's not the case. The friend's coworker was upset because they felt ignored. Even if the author didn't intend to ignore anyone, the action of wearing headphones can come across as dismissive.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author isn't avoiding interaction out of arrogance or disrespect. It's a coping mechanism due to their mental health conditions. However, the impact on others still matters. The coworker felt hurt, which is a valid feeling. The author might not have meant to cause that, but their actions did affect someone else negatively.\n\nThe key here is balancing the author's need for comfort with the potential impact on others. The author could consider times when interaction is necessary, like if an employee approaches them, but if they're just browsing and using self-checkout, maybe it's less likely to cause issues. Still, there's a responsibility to be mindful of how one's actions affect others in shared spaces.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their actions stem from a need to manage their mental health. However, they might need to be more aware of their environment and possibly make small efforts to acknowledge employees, like a nod or a smile, if approached. But in general, using headphones for personal comfort isn't inherently wrong, especially given their circumstances.\n"
