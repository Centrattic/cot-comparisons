I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to block out noise and manage her anxiety. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so maybe she avoids interacting with employees. Her friend mentioned that a coworker was upset when someone ignored them by wearing headphones.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. She has legitimate mental health challenges that make her avoid social interactions. Using headphones is a coping mechanism. She's not being rude on purpose; she's trying to manage her anxiety. It's important to recognize that her actions stem from a need to self-regulate in a stressful environment.\n\nOn the other hand, employees might feel ignored or disrespected if a customer is wearing headphones and not engaging. Retail workers often deal with difficult customers and might interpret the headphones as a lack of respect or consideration. However, the author isn't being intentionally dismissive; she's focused on her own comfort.\n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author isn't trying to be an asshole, but her actions might inadvertently hurt others. It's a balance between her right to manage her mental health and the employees' feelings. The fact that she's aware of the potential impact and is seeking opinions shows some level of consideration. \n\nIn many public places, wearing headphones is common, and people often don't expect interaction. However, in a store with employees, there's an unspoken expectation of basic engagement. That said, the author isn't interacting with the employees, just avoiding them, which might be seen as impolite. But given her circumstances, it's a necessary step for her well-being.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a nuanced situation. She's not malicious, but her actions might be seen as inconsiderate. However, considering her mental health, it's a way to cope. The answer might depend on whether the community here values accommodation for mental health over the employees' feelings. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions are a necessary personal accommodation, even if it could be perceived as rude. The author isn't intentionally ignoring people but managing her anxiety.\n"
