I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The person has severe social anxiety, depression, and is on the autism spectrum. She uses the headphones to cope with overwhelming environments, especially during her long walk to work. Her grandfather gave her the Beats Solo3 as a Christmas gift, and she wants to use them as much as possible. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact with employees much.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The friend thinks people who do that are assholes, but the author feels relieved when others ignore her. Now she's worried she might have hurt someone's feelings by zoned out during her visits, even though she didn't mean to. The question is, is she in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health. People with social anxiety and autism often find social interactions extremely challenging and stressful. Using headphones as a coping mechanism in public spaces is a common strategy to reduce sensory overload and anxiety. It's important to recognize that her behavior is a result of her need to manage her mental health, not an intention to be rude or dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, retail employees might rely on customer interactions as part of their job. If someone enters the store with headphones on and doesn't acknowledge them, it could be misinterpreted, especially if the employee is expecting assistance. However, the author specifically chooses stores with self-checkouts to avoid interaction, which suggests she's aware of the situation and trying to minimize potential issues. \n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt anyone, and her use of headphones is a personal coping mechanism. The employees who felt ignored probably experienced an unintended impact, but the author isn't in the wrong if she's not actively avoiding help when she needs it. It's also worth noting that the problem might be more about the employees' expectations of customer interaction rather than the customer's right to use personal space tools.\n\nAdditionally, the author included a PS asking for kindness towards retail workers, showing empathy and understanding. This indicates she's aware of their tough job and isn't disregarding their feelings but is seeking a balance between her needs and theirs. \n\nSo, considering her mental health needs and the steps she's taken to use self-checkout, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
