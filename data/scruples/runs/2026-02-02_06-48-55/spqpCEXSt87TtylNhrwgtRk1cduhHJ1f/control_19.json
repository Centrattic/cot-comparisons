I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in public stores, given their mental health conditions. \n\nFirst, the author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. These conditions make social interactions difficult and overwhelming. They use headphones to manage sensory overload and to cope during walks to work. The headphones are a coping mechanism, which is understandable.\n\nThey mention that they only shop at stores with self-checkout, implying they avoid interactions that way. But a friend's co-worker was upset because the author might have ignored them. The author realized they might have made others feel dismissed. However, the main conflict is between their need for comfort and others' potential feelings of being ignored.\n\nThe key points to consider are: the author's mental health and their valid use of coping strategies, versus the possible impact on others. The author isn't being intentionally rude; they're managing their own well-being. They also acknowledge the perspective of retail workers, which shows some consideration.\n\nRetail workers might find it frustrating if customers don't engage, but the author isn't avoiding them out of arrogance. It's a matter of their mental health needs. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions are considered inconsiderate despite their circumstances. But since they're using a legitimate coping mechanism and aren't intentionally being rude, the answer is probably that they're not in the wrong.\n"
