I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The person has severe social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough for them. They were given high-end headphones for Christmas and use them to cope with noisy environments, especially when going to work. They wear them in stores to manage their anxiety and find it easier to shop without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe dilemma arises when a friend mentions that someone cried because they were ignored when the author was wearing headphones. The author is now worried that by using the headphones, they might have come off as dismissive or rude, even though they didn't mean to. The author is trying to balance their need for comfort and managing their anxiety with the potential impact on others.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's mental health conditions, their legitimate need to use headphones as a coping mechanism, and the unintended consequences of their actions. The question is whether their actions are inconsiderate or if they're justified in using the headphones for their well-being.\n\nOn one hand, using headphones in public is generally acceptable, and the author has a valid reason due to their conditions. People often wear headphones in stores for various reasons, like blocking noise or focusing. On the other hand, if someone approaches them to help or talk, not responding could be seen as rude, especially if the employee feels ignored. However, the author didn't intentionally ignore anyone; they were just zoning out due to their anxiety.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate without intent. Since their actions are a necessary accommodation for their mental health, and they're using self-checkout where possible, it's more about their need to manage their well-being. The real issue might be about awareness of others, but the author already acknowledges this and shows empathy by writing the post and asking for feedback. They also mention being considerate towards retail staff, which adds to their awareness.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. Their use of headphones is a personal coping strategy for a legitimate medical condition. It's not about being dismissive but managing their mental health. While it's possible someone might feel ignored, the author didn't intend to be rude, and their actions are a necessary accommodation. Retail staff should understand that not everyone can engage in social interactions easily, and it's not fair to assume malice without knowing the context.\n"
