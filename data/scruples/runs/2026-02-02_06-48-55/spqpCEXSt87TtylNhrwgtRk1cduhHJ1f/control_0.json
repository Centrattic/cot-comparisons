I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let's start by looking at the context she provided. She's 20, has severe social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She got the headphones as a gift from her grandpa, which were more expensive than she expected. She uses them to cope with public places because they help muffle noise and provide a distraction when being around people is overwhelming. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she didn't think it was a problem. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker was upset because someone (possibly the author) ignored them by wearing headphones. The friend says people think it's rude, but the author feels she shouldn't have to be uncomfortable just to get a packet of crisps.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's mental health conditions and her need for the headphones to manage her anxiety and sensory overload. People with social anxiety and autism often find social interactions extremely challenging and stressful. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy to reduce sensory input. The friend's coworker was clearly hurt, thinking the author was ignoring them, which is a valid concern from the employee's perspective. But the author didn't intend to be rude; it's more about her personal need to stay comfortable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, employees might feel disrespected if a customer doesn't acknowledge them. Especially in retail, where employees often rely on customer interactions as part of their job. If the author walked past employees without noticing or interacting, it could be perceived as dismissive. However, she's using the headphones to cope with her anxiety, which is a legitimate reason. She's not trying to be an asshole, but rather to manage her mental health. \n\nRetail employees do deal with a lot, and customers should be considerate. But at the same time, the author has a right to use the headphones in public spaces if they help her, provided she isn't violating any store policies. The friend's coworker's reaction is understandable, but the author's intention was to reduce her own stress, not to be inconsiderate. It's a balance between the customer's right to use their personal items and the employee's feelings about being acknowledged. \n\nI think the answer here is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a result of her mental health needs, not an intentional disregard for others. However, she might need to be more aware of her environment to avoid completely ignoring employees, maybe by having one ear open or looking approachable. But the core issue is her need to manage her anxiety, which is valid. The friend's coworker's reaction is a bit harsh, and the author's intention wasn't to be rude. So she's not the asshole, but maybe she can adjust slightly to be more considerate without compromising her well-being.\n"
