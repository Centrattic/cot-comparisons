I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, autism, and depression, which makes public interactions stressful. They wear headphones to cope, especially in noisy environments. The friend mentioned that someone cried because the author ignored them. The author is worried they came off as an asshole but also need the headphones for their mental health.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons for wearing headphones due to their conditions. They're using them as a coping mechanism, which is understandable. Retail work can be tough, and employees might appreciate some space. But on the other hand, walking into a store with headphones on might be seen as dismissive. Retail employees might expect some interaction, especially if they're trying to help. The author could have been inconsiderate without realizing it.\n\nHowever, the key here is the intent. The author isn't being rude on purpose; they're managing their mental health. They also shop at places with self-checkout, which minimizes interaction. The problem is more about communication and awareness rather than malice. It's a tough balance between personal needs and social expectations. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If being in the wrong means intentionally being rude, then no. But if it's about not being aware of how their actions affect others, maybe. But given their mental health conditions, it's a mitigating factor. The answer might be that they're not in the wrong, but they should be aware and maybe make an effort to acknowledge people if possible. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
