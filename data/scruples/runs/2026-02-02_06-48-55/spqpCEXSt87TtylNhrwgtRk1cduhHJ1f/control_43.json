I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and to avoid the stress of social interactions, especially during her commute. Her grandparents gave her expensive headphones as a Christmas gift, which she uses to make her daily walks to work more manageable.\n\nShe started wearing them in stores because it helps her manage the stress of public places, and she only goes to stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. However, a friend mentioned that someone was upset because the author might have ignored them. The author is now worried she's come across as an asshole by not engaging when people might want to talk.\n\nSo, the main factors here are her mental health conditions and her need to use headphones as a coping mechanism. The question is whether this is acceptable or if she's being inconsiderate. On one hand, people in retail might feel ignored if a customer doesn't acknowledge them, but on the other hand, she has legitimate reasons for needing the headphones. The key points are her intent (not to be rude, but to manage anxiety) and the impact on others. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if she's not aware people might need to interact with her, maybe there's some inconsideration. However, given her mental health, she's using a necessary tool. The stores she uses have self-checkout, so maybe the assumption is she can shop without interaction. The friend's coworker's reaction is a concern, but the author didn't intentionally ignore\u2014she just needed the headphones for her well-being. \n\nSo, considering her mental health challenges and that she's using the headphones to cope, it's more about finding a balance. She might need to be more mindful of her presence, but it's not necessarily her fault. Retail workers do deal with all sorts of customers, and while being ignored can be frustrating, the author isn't being malicious. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong, but she could be considerate by adjusting her behavior if needed.\n"
