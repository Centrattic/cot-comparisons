I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, uses headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she's avoiding interaction. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She has a valid medical condition that makes social interactions difficult. Using headphones as a coping mechanism is common for people with autism or anxiety. It's important to recognize that she's using them for mental health reasons, not to be rude.\n\nHowever, the issue is that people might feel ignored or dismissed when she's wearing headphones. The friend's coworker crying is a problem. Even if she's not trying to be rude, her actions might be perceived as such. The key here is intention vs. impact. She didn't mean to hurt anyone, but her actions did. \n\nBut should she be blamed for that? People with disabilities often have to navigate social norms differently. It's possible that she's not in the wrong if she's using accommodations she needs. However, maybe she could take small steps to mitigate the impact, like removing headphones when entering a store or giving a friendly gesture if someone approaches. \n\nThe store environment usually requires some level of interaction, even if it's just a cashier. Since she uses self-checkout, that's a conscious choice to minimize interaction. But she might still encounter employees, so maybe she's not entirely at fault. The question is whether ignoring someone by default is wrong. \n\nIn some cultures or contexts, wearing headphones can signal that you don't want to be disturbed. However, in a retail setting, where employees might need to assist, it's possible that people take it as a slight. But considering her mental health needs, it's a balance between her well-being and others' feelings.\n\nI think the answer here is B, not in the wrong. She's using a necessary tool for her mental health, and the impact on others isn't entirely her fault. However, she might want to be more mindful, but that doesn't make her the asshole.\n"
