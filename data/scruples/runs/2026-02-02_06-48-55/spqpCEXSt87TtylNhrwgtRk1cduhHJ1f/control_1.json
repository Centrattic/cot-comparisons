I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough. She got expensive headphones as a gift and uses them in stores to cope with noise and avoid stress. A friend told her that someone at work was upset because she ignored them while wearing headphones. The question is whether she's being an asshole by doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She has legitimate mental health issues that make being in social situations difficult. Using headphones is a coping mechanism, which is understandable. The stores she shops at have self-checkouts, so maybe she's trying to avoid interaction as much as possible. But the issue is that she might be ignoring people, like retail workers, who might try to help her. \n\nOn one hand, people in retail do have tough jobs and might expect some level of engagement. If she's in the store, even with headphones, and a worker tries to assist her but she doesn't respond, that could be frustrating. However, she's not the one initiating contact, and she's not doing anything to prevent them from helping her. She's just using headphones to manage her anxiety. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of her mental health. It's important to accommodate people with conditions that affect social interactions. She's not being intentionally rude; it's more about her need for a coping strategy. The friend's coworker might have felt ignored, but the author didn't mean to be dismissive. \n\nSo, the question is whether her actions are inconsiderate. While it's possible that some people might feel slighted, it's also about her right to manage her anxiety. The key points are her mental health, the fact that she's using self-checkout to avoid interaction, and that she's not actively ignoring help. The friend's coworker's reaction is a valid concern, but the author's intent is to manage her own well-being. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh intent and impact. The impact is there, but the intent is not malicious. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, as she's managing her mental health, and the stores she uses have self-checkout, so interaction isn't necessary. However, maybe she could be more aware of her surroundings or maybe a nod or gesture when someone approaches. But given the context, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
