I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has severe social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with public spaces, especially when going to work. Her grandpa bought her these Beats headphones, which she's happy about. She wears them in stores to block out noise and distractions, only going to places with self-checkout. However, a friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might think she's an asshole for not engaging.\n\nSo, the main points here are her mental health conditions and her use of headphones as a coping mechanism. On one hand, she's dealing with real issues that make social interactions stressful. On the other hand, people might feel ignored if she's not present when they try to talk to her. The question is whether her actions are considered wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From her point of view, she's managing her anxiety and doing what's necessary to function in public. From the store employees' side, they might feel disrespected or ignored. But she argues she's only using self-checkout, so maybe she's not interacting with staff, thus avoiding the issue. However, if someone approaches her, she might be ignoring them unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she's not trying to be rude, just avoiding social interaction due to her conditions. It's important to recognize that mental health struggles are valid. However, the impact on others is also a factor. Maybe there's a middle ground, like being aware of her surroundings or offering a quick acknowledgment when needed. But does that make her in the wrong? It's a balance between her needs and others' expectations.\n\nIn the end, I think the answer hinges on intent and awareness. She's not being intentionally rude; she's coping with her conditions. The problem arises when her actions inadvertently hurt others. However, given her circumstances, it's a valid coping strategy. So the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but could be more mindful. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but I need to decide based on the context.\n"
