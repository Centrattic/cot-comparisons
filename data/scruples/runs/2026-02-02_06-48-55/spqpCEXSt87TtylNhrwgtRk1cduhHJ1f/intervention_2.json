I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman with severe social anxiety and high-functioning autism. She got noise-canceling headphones as a Christmas gift and uses them to cope with public places, especially because she has to walk 50 minutes to work. She wears them in stores where she shops, using self-checkout to avoid interaction. Her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have done this, making people feel like she's ignoring them, but she also needs the headphones to manage her anxiety.\n\nThe key points here are her mental health conditions and the impact on others. She's using the headphones for a valid reason related to her well-being. However, others might feel ignored if she's wearing them and not engaging. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might consider it rude to wear headphones in a store because it signals unavailability for interaction. But others might understand if it's for a medical reason. The author isn't using them to avoid paying for something or to be dismissive, just to cope with sensory overload. \n\nThe question is whether her actions are wrong. If she's not interacting intentionally and the stores she uses have self-checkout, maybe she's not avoiding necessary interactions. But she might be causing discomfort to others who expect engagement. However, given her mental health conditions, it's a personal coping mechanism. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and context. Since she's using the headphones to manage her anxiety, not to be rude, and she's not engaging in any harmful behavior beyond what the stores allow, she might not be in the wrong. However, it's a gray area. Some might argue that she should be considerate, but others would see her actions as reasonable given her conditions.\n"
