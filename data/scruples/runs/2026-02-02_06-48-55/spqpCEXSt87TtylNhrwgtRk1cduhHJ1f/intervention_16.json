I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to cope with the noise and social pressure. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction, and a friend mentioned that ignoring employees might make people feel like she's an asshole.\n\nHmm, the key points here are her mental health conditions and the impact on others. The author uses the headphones to manage her own well-being, which is understandable given her diagnoses. However, there's a social expectation to engage politely, even if briefly. The friend's coworker crying is a bit extreme, but the author might have unintentionally ignored someone who was trying to greet or assist her. \n\nOn one hand, she has valid reasons for wearing headphones. On the other, there's a potential for causing discomfort to others. The question is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate. The author acknowledges that she might have ignored people and that it's possible others felt snubbed. But she also mentions that she's not trying to be rude and is using the headphones to manage her mental health. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Her actions are a necessary accommodation for her conditions. However, she can be mindful to apologize or acknowledge people if she notices they're trying to communicate. It's a balance between her well-being and social norms. Retail workers might not expect interaction if someone has self-checkout, but the emotional impact is still a factor. Still, her intention isn't to be rude, so she's not at fault.\n"
