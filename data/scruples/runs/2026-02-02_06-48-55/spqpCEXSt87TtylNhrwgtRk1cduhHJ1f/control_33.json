I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses headphones to cope with noise and avoid social interactions, which helps her shop without stress. Her friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored her, and others might perceive her as an asshole for not engaging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism might find loud environments overwhelming, and using headphones as a coping mechanism is a common strategy. It's a way to manage their mental health and perform daily tasks without being overwhelmed. So, from her perspective, it's necessary for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the potential impact on retail employees. If she's ignoring people who want to help her, it might make them feel undervalued or disrespected. However, the author doesn't intend to be rude; she's not aware they want to talk. The key here is whether her action is intentionally dismissive. She's using the headphones to manage her anxiety, not to be rude.\n\nThe stores she shops at have self-checkout, so maybe she's not needing assistance. But if an employee approaches her for help, she might be ignoring them. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect someone with her conditions to interact when it causes her significant stress. \n\nSociety often has expectations about social interactions, but mental health conditions can affect behavior. There's a balance between accommodating personal needs and respecting others. The author isn't causing harm intentionally; she's managing her health. Retail employees dealing with difficult customers can be tough, but not all customers will engage. It's possible that the employees understand or should understand the need for personal space, especially if it's evident through body language or headphones.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might unintentionally hurt someone by not engaging, her actions are rooted in managing a mental health condition. It's more about needing understanding from others rather than her being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
