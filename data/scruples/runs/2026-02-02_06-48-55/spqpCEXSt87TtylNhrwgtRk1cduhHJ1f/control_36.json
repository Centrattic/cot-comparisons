I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes social interactions really tough for her. She uses the headphones to cope in noisy environments and to manage stress. She's been doing this in stores with self-checkout, so maybe she's trying to avoid interactions she finds overwhelming.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have made people feel like she's an asshole by not engaging. But she also feels she has a valid reason due to her mental health struggles.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, using headphones in public can be seen as a way to block people out, which might come off as rude or dismissive, especially if someone tries to interact with her. Retail employees might feel disrespected or ignored. However, her situation is a bit more nuanced because of her mental health conditions. She's using the headphones as a necessary coping mechanism, not out of arrogance.\n\nIt's important to consider both perspectives. The author isn't intentionally being mean; she's managing her anxiety. But the impact on others is real. Maybe there's a middle ground, like removing headphones when entering a store or being mindful of her surroundings. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since her actions are a result of her health issues, which are valid and legitimate, and she's not being malicious, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. But there's a case to be made that she could be considerate in a different way. The key is intent vs. impact. Her intent is to cope, but the impact might hurt others. However, given her circumstances, it's not necessarily her fault. So leaning towards B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
