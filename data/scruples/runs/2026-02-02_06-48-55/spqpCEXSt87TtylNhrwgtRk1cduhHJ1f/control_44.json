I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether wearing headphones in a store is being an asshole. The author has severe social anxiety and high functioning autism, which makes social interactions really hard for her. She uses the headphones to cope in noisy environments, especially to block out people talking. She shops at stores with self-checkouts, so she doesn't need to interact much. \n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker cried because someone ignored them by wearing headphones, and the friend thinks people who do that are assholes. The author is worried she might have made others feel that way. She's not ignoring people out of arrogance but to manage her own anxiety. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's using the headphones for a legitimate reason, not to be rude. But maybe she's not considering how others might perceive it. However, given her mental health challenges, it's a coping mechanism. The stores she goes to have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding necessary interactions. The key here is whether her action is inconsiderate. It's a balance between her need for comfort and others' expectations.\n\nI think the answer is B (No) because she's not being intentionally rude. Her actions are a result of her need to manage her anxiety, and she's aware of the potential issue now. The fact that she's reflecting on it and asking for advice shows she's trying to be considerate. The stores she uses support self-checkout, so she's not avoiding interactions she's required to have. Retail employees might feel ignored, but her intent isn't to be an asshole. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
