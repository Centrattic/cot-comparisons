I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has social anxiety, depression, and high functioning autism. She uses headphones to cope with overwhelming environments, especially when dealing with people. That makes sense because sensory overload can be really tough for someone with these conditions. The headphones help her manage stress and make her shopping experience easier, especially in stores with self-checkout where she doesn't need to interact as much.\n\nShe got the headphones as a gift from her grandpa, which she appreciates. She's using them to make her commute and shopping trips more bearable. The main issue is that she's wearing them in stores, which might make others feel ignored. Her friend mentioned a coworker was upset because someone didn't acknowledge them, and the author is worried she might have done the same.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, using headphones in public is pretty common. Many people listen to music or podcasts to block out noise. Stores often allow that as long as it's not disruptive. However, the problem arises when others feel ignored or disrespected. If someone approaches her to help, and she doesn't respond, it could be seen as rude.\n\nBut the key here is intent. The author isn't intentionally ignoring people. She's trying to cope with her anxiety and sensory issues. She's aware of the possibility of others feeling ignored, but she's also managing her own mental health. The stores she shops at have self-checkout, so she's not avoiding interactions that are necessary. She's not being hostile, just trying to navigate a stressful environment.\n\nIn retail environments, customers are generally allowed to have their space. However, if an employee needs to assist and the customer is unresponsive, it could cause issues. But given that the author is using self-checkout, maybe she's avoiding interactions where help isn't needed. Still, the author isn't causing harm beyond maybe making someone feel unacknowledged accidentally.\n\nThe author is also empathetic, as shown by her PS about retail workers. She's not being malicious. So while it's possible she unintentionally hurt someone, the root cause is her need to manage her mental health. The stores she frequents have self-checkout, which minimizes the need for interaction. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's using a coping mechanism that's necessary for her well-being, and as long as she's not actively ignoring requests for help, her actions are justified. The answer should be B (No).\n"
