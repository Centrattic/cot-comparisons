I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety and autism, which make public interactions stressful. She uses headphones to cope, which helps her manage noise and social pressure. She shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interactions, but a friend mentioned that employees might feel ignored if she's zoned out with headphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons related to her health. She\u2019s using the headphones as a necessary accommodation. People with anxiety or autism might need these coping mechanisms to function in public spaces. The law probably doesn't prohibit wearing headphones in stores, so there's no legal wrong here.\n\nOn the other hand, employees might feel disrespected if they try to interact and are ignored. But the author isn't intentionally being rude; she's unaware because she's using headphones to manage her anxiety. The friend's coworker crying is a strong reaction, but maybe it's more about the employee's need for interaction versus the customer's need for calm.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points are her intent and the context. She's not trying to be an asshole; she's managing her mental health. Stores usually allow customers to shop without interaction, especially with self-checkout. However, if an employee does need to speak to her (like about a product), she might be less approachable. But in general, wearing headphones is a common practice for many people to block out noise, not just those with conditions.\n\nSo, considering her reasons and the lack of intent to be rude, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B. She's using a necessary tool for her well-being, and while it might inconvenience others, it's not her fault. The onus is on stores to provide services that accommodate different customer needs.\n"
