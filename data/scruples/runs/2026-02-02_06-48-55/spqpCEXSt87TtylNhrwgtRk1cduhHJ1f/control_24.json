I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about wearing headphones in a store. The author has social anxiety and autism, which makes public interactions really tough for them. They use headphones to cope with the noise and stress, especially during their long walk to work. They started wearing them in stores where they shop, using self-checkout, and now a friend mentioned that someone felt ignored when the author walked in with headphones on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid reasons for needing the headphones to manage their mental health. It's important to acknowledge that their actions are a coping mechanism. On the other hand, the retail employees might feel ignored if the customer doesn't respond to them. The author's friend's coworker felt upset, which suggests that maybe the customer's presence with headphones on came off as dismissive.\n\nBut wait, the author wasn't intentionally ignoring anyone. They were zoning out due to their anxiety and autism. They also mention that they shop in stores with self-checkout, which might mean they don't need to interact with staff. However, if they didn't realize that employees might approach them and that being unresponsive could be hurtful, that's a point to consider.\n\nIs there a balance here? The author has a right to use accommodations for their mental health, but maybe there's a way to do it without making others feel ignored. Perhaps they could be more aware of their surroundings or signal that they're not available for conversation. But is that being in the wrong? Or is it a misunderstanding?\n\nAlso, the author ends by saying to be nice to retail workers, showing they care about their well-being. So maybe they're not in the wrong intentionally, but perhaps need to be more mindful of how their actions affect others. However, given their conditions, it's not as simple as just removing the headphones. They might need alternative solutions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong on purpose, but they could be more aware. However, some might argue that even unintentionally ignoring someone is still hurtful, making the answer A (Yes). But given the context of mental health challenges, it's more about needing to find a balance rather than outright being wrong. I think the right answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
