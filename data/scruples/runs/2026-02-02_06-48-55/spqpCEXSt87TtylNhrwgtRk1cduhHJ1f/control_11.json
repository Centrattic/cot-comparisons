I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, autism, and depression, which makes public interactions tough. She uses headphones to cope with sensory overload and to have a buffer in social situations. She shops at stores with self-checkout to minimize interaction. Her friend mentioned that others might see her as an asshole for not engaging, but she's trying to manage her mental health.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of her mental health conditions. People with social anxiety and autism often need strategies to navigate social environments without becoming overwhelmed. Headphones can serve as a tool to reduce sensory input, which is a common coping mechanism. \n\nOn the other hand, the concern is about how others might perceive her. The friend's coworker felt ignored, which is a valid feeling. However, the author didn't intentionally ignore anyone; she was zoning out due to her need for sensory regulation. It's important to note that she uses self-checkout, which likely reduces direct interaction, but maybe in other parts of the store, employees might expect engagement.\n\nIs there a balance here? The author is managing her mental health, which is crucial. However, there's a social expectation to be aware of one's surroundings and respond appropriately. But given her circumstances, is she at fault? Probably not. The key points are that she's using headphones for a valid reason related to her health and that she's not avoiding interactions out of arrogance but necessity. Additionally, the friend's coworker's reaction is more about their own feelings than the author's intent. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. She's using a necessary coping strategy for her conditions, and while others might feel ignored, it's not her intention and she's taking steps to minimize interactions where possible (self-checkout). The responsibility here isn't solely on her; society should be more accommodating to people with sensory and social challenges.\n"
