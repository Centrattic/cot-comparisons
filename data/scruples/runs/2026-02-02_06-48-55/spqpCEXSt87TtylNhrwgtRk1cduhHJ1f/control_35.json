I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in stores. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses headphones to cope with noise and avoid overwhelming situations. Her grandpa gave her the headphones, and she uses them in places with self-checkout to minimize interaction.\n\nHer friend mentioned that a coworker was upset because someone ignored them by wearing headphones. The author is worried she might have done this, making people feel snubbed. But she argues she's just trying to manage her mental health.\n\nSo, the key points are: her mental health issues necessitate the headphones, she's not avoiding interactions out of arrogance, and she's conscious of the impact on others. The question is whether her actions are considered inconsiderate or if her needs justify it. Retail staff often deal with difficult customers, but she's not being hostile, just trying to cope. It's a balance between her need for comfort and the potential for others to feel ignored. The community's response usually considers such contexts, so it's possible she's not the asshole (B). However, maybe she should be mindful of places where interaction is expected, like stores where employees might need to assist her. But she uses self-checkout, so maybe she's minimizing that risk. Overall, her intention isn't to be rude, so B seems more likely.\n"
