I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety and high functioning autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses headphones to cope with noise and social overwhelm. She shops at stores with self-checkout, so she doesn't need to interact with staff. However, a friend told her that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might perceive her as an asshole for not engaging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid reason for wearing headphones due to her mental health conditions. It's a coping mechanism that helps her manage stress in public spaces. On the other hand, there's the concern that employees might feel ignored or disrespected. Retail jobs are tough, and employees might expect some level of acknowledgment, even if it's just a nod or a greeting.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't intend to be rude; her actions were to help herself cope. However, her actions might have unintended consequences for others. The question is whether her right to use her headphones outweighs the potential discomfort of the employees. \n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't avoiding necessary interactions, as she uses self-checkout. The issue arises when she's in the store and possibly ignoring employees. While she didn't intend to be dismissive, the perception from others could still be negative. The friend's co-worker crying is a significant point. Even if unintended, causing someone to feel unvalued is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the author's mental health is a crucial factor. People with social anxiety and autism often need accommodations to manage their conditions. Society should ideally be more understanding of such needs. There's a balance between respecting one's personal space and being considerate towards others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. She's not being malicious, but the impact on others is real. Maybe the answer lies in finding a middle ground. Perhaps she could acknowledge employees with a small gesture without removing her headphones. That way, she maintains her coping mechanism while showing respect to others. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are understandable and justified by her health needs, the effect on others might mean she's partially at fault. But given the circumstances, the responsibility isn't entirely hers. Retail staff should be aware that not all customers are comfortable with interaction, but customers also have a duty to be considerate. It's a complex situation where both sides need to adjust.\n"
