I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has severe social anxiety and autism, which makes social interactions challenging. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and to make her trips to the store less stressful. She only shops at places with self-checkout to minimize interaction. However, a friend mentioned that a coworker was upset when someone wearing headphones ignored them, leading the author to worry she might have done the same.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, first, her mental health conditions are significant. People with social anxiety and autism often need strategies to manage their interactions. Wearing headphones is a common coping mechanism. The key here is intent. She's not trying to be rude; she's using the headphones for her well-being. On the other hand, the store employees might feel disrespected or ignored if they try to interact and she doesn't respond. But the author didn't intentionally ignore them. She's unaware because she's zoned out. \n\nHowever, maybe she could consider the employees' perspective. If an employee approaches her, she might not realize they're trying to talk. But since she uses self-checkout, maybe she's not expecting interaction. Still, being in a public space requires some consideration. But given her conditions, it's a necessary accommodation. The friend's coworker crying is a bit extreme, but the author's actions might inadvertently cause that. However, the author is also managing her mental health. It's a balance between her needs and the employees' expectations. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect her to remove headphones in a store, but since she's not in a situation requiring interaction (self-checkout), maybe it's acceptable. The author isn't being intentionally inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely B (Not the Asshole) because her actions are a result of her mental health needs and she's not being deliberately rude.\n"
