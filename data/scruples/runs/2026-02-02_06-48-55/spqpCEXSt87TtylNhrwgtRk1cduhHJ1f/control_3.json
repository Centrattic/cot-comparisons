I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and high-functioning autism. She uses the headphones to cope with sensory overload and stress in public places.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. People with social anxiety might find it hard to interact, and using headphones as a coping mechanism is common. Stores can be overwhelming, and self-checkout helps, but she's using headphones even when interacting with staff. The friend's coworker felt ignored and upset. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's mental health condition, the necessity of headphones for her well-being, and the potential impact on retail employees. The question is whether her actions are inconsiderate. \n\nOn one hand, she's managing her mental health, which is valid. On the other hand, employees might feel disrespected or ignored if a customer doesn't acknowledge them. But she's not being rude intentionally; she's zoning out due to anxiety. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong. Her actions are a coping strategy for her conditions. However, maybe she could make an effort to be aware of staff, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about possible improvements. The main issue is her intent vs. the effect. Since she's not intentionally ignoring, and it's a medical need, she isn't the asshole here.\n"
