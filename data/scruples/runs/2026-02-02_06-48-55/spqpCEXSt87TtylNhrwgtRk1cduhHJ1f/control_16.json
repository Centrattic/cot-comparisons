I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has a history of social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to cope with noise and avoid overwhelming situations. She shops at stores with self-checkout to minimize interaction, and she didn't realize her behavior might be offensive until her friend mentioned it. The question is whether she's being inconsiderate or if she's just managing her mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. People with social anxiety and autism might need strategies to handle public spaces. Headphones can be a tool for sensory overload management. On the other hand, the friend's coworker was hurt by being ignored, which is a valid concern. Retail workers often have to deal with a lot, so making them feel dismissed isn't ideal.\n\nBut the author isn't acting out of arrogance; she's using a coping mechanism. It's possible she didn't mean to ignore anyone. However, there's a balance between her needs and others' feelings. Maybe she could be more aware, but is she necessarily wrong? The key here is intent. If she's not intentionally ignoring people, and she's using headphones to manage her mental health, then the blame isn't entirely on her. Retail employees should be treated with respect, but if she's not aware of people trying to engage, it's more of a misunderstanding. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong, but maybe she can make adjustments, like removing headphones if someone approaches her in the store. But the question is strictly whether she's in the wrong. Considering her mental health reasons and the fact that she's using headphones for a valid purpose, the answer is B. The friend's coworker's feelings are important, but the author isn't malicious. So the answer is B.\n"
