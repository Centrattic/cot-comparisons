I was expecting a cheap pair of \u00a315 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here\u2019s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it\u2019s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it\u2019s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI\u2019ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn\u2019t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn\u2019t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I\u2019m weird) and that everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn\u2019t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it\u2019s a tough job and they don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with assholes)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing headphones in the store. The author has social anxiety, depression, and autism, which makes public interactions stressful. She uses the headphones to cope, and she shops at stores with self-checkout to avoid interaction. Her friend mentioned that someone cried because she ignored them, and others might see her as rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her mental health. People with social anxiety or autism might find loud environments overwhelming, and using headphones is a common coping mechanism. However, entering a store and having headphones on could make employees or other customers feel ignored if they need assistance. The key point here is whether she's being considerate.\n\nShe mentions she shops at stores with self-checkout, which implies she's aware of avoiding interactions. But if someone approaches her to help, ignoring them could be seen as rude. However, the author might not realize when someone is trying to reach out, especially if she's zoning out. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for this behavior.\n\nThe friend's co-worker crying is a strong reaction. But maybe that person expected help and felt disrespected. The author's intention is to manage her anxiety, which is valid. However, there's a balance between her need and others' expectations. If she's in a store and someone needs to talk to her, like an employee asking if she needs help, she might be expected to respond. If she's avoiding all interaction, that could be seen as inconsiderate, even if unintentional.\n\nOn the other hand, she's not deliberately ignoring people\u2014she's managing her mental health. There's also the aspect of retail employees who might feel undervalued if customers ignore them. But she's not doing it to be rude; it's a coping strategy. The answer might depend on whether the stores are self-service and whether employees are supposed to approach her. If she can complete her tasks without interaction, then it's fair. But if employees are expecting engagement, then her not responding could be seen as rude.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the stores are self-checkout and she's not expecting interaction, then no. But if she's in a store where employees might approach her for assistance, and she ignores them, that's where the conflict arises. The author might need to be more aware of when people are trying to engage, but her primary issue is a mental health coping mechanism. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong, because her actions are a result of managing her conditions, even if others might feel ignored.\n"
