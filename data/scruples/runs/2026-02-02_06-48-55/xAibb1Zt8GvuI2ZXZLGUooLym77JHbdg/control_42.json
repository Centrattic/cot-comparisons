They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors: the author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a large mix breed. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the small dog. The author kicks the dog the second time and threatens to kill it if it happens again. The neighbor apologizes but doesn't take any action to prevent it from happening again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and morality here. In many places, laws protect animals from abuse. The author's actions involved kicking the dog, which could be considered animal cruelty. Even if the dog was attacking their own pet, using force might not be justified unless it's in self-defense for their own animal. However, the line between defense and assault can be blurry. \n\nNext, the threat to kill the dog is a big point. Threats of violence or harm to another person's property (even if it's an animal) can have legal repercussions. The neighbor might have the right to take legal action against the author for threatening their dog, especially if it's their property.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's inaction is also a problem. If they knew their dog was a danger and didn't take steps to control it, like keeping it on a leash or securing the yard, they might be at fault for not preventing the attacks. But the author's response involved physical harm to the dog and threats, which could be seen as excessive.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to use force? Was the force reasonable? Was the threat justified? Also, the neighbor's responsibility in controlling their dog. Depending on local laws, the author might be within their rights to protect their own pet, but the method (kicking) and the threats might cross a line. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals. Kicking might be considered reasonable in an immediate threat, but the threat to kill the dog is more problematic. The neighbor's lack of action is also an issue, but that doesn't excuse the author's potential overreaction.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for both physically harming the dog and making threats, even if provoked. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog, but the author's actions could still be considered inappropriate or illegal. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
