They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation is that the neighbor's dog, which is a large breed, jumped over the wall and attacked their smaller dog. The author kicked the dog twice to make it let go, and then threatened to kill it or call animal control if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal protection. In many places, people have the right to protect their property and pets. If the dog was trespassing and attacking, the owner might be responsible. But physically harming the dog could be an issue. Kicking an animal might be considered animal cruelty, even if it's another person's dog. Also, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic legally, as that might be considered a threat. However, if the dog is a danger to their own pet, there might be some justification.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction is also important. The neighbor said they were sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author felt they needed to take matters into their own hands. However, the appropriate course of action might have been to contact animal control or the neighbor first, rather than using force. The author's response could be seen as excessive, especially if the dog was just defending itself or if the situation could have been handled without violence.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to kill the dog might be a red flag. While understandable from a place of fear for their pet, making such threats could lead to legal trouble. The neighbor's inaction is also a point\u2014maybe they should have taken steps to control their dog better, but the author's response might not be justified if they didn't follow proper procedures.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be specific laws about dealing with trespassing animals. If the neighbor's dog is a known threat, the author might have a case, but using force could still be an issue. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the threat. Kicking the dog to make it let go might be necessary to save their own pet, but doing it \"harder\" could be excessive. The threats afterward might also be problematic, even if they were a reaction to fear.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be seen as self-defense for their pet, but the method and threats could land them in the wrong. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that they used physical force on another person's animal without legal justification (unless their jurisdiction allows it), it might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But it's not entirely clear. The answer could be either way. Hmm.\n"
