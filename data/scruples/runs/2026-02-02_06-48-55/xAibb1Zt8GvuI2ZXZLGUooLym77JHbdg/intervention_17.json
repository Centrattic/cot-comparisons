They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. Let's start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The writer lives next door to a family with a large dog, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The writer has a small dog, a Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix. The large dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked the small dog both times. The first time, the writer pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog attacked again, and the writer kicked it twice to make it release their dog. The neighbor responded with an apology but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Protection of Property and Pets**: In many jurisdictions, people have the right to protect their property and their animals from immediate threats. If the neighbor's dog was uncontrolled and a threat to their small dog, it could be seen as self-defense for the writer to act to prevent harm. Kicking the dog to stop it from attacking their own pet might be justified in the moment as a defensive action.\n\n2. **Use of Force**: However, the use of force must be reasonable. Kicking a dog that's attacking your pet could be considered excessive if there's a safer way to separate them. For example, using a stick or a tool to break up the fight might be considered less harmful. The writer's action of kicking the dog twice, especially \"harder\" the second time, might be seen as disproportionate, depending on the circumstances.\n\n3. **Threats Made**: The writer threatened to kill the dog if it attacked again. Making threats, even if motivated by fear and protectiveness, can be problematic. It's possible that this could lead to legal issues if the neighbor reports it. The threat of violence or harm to another person's animal (even if they're negligent) might not be justified beyond a certain point, even if the dog is a danger.\n\n4. **Neighbor's Responsibility**: The neighbor's inaction is a significant factor. They allowed their dog to repeatedly jump the fence and attack another animal without taking steps to control it, like using a leash or training. The neighbor is clearly negligent in this situation, which adds context to the writer's actions.\n\n5. **Legal Perspective**: Legally, the writer might have a defense in protecting their own pet, but the method of defense (kicking) and the subsequent threats could complicate things. Some places have specific laws about how to handle animal fights, and using physical force against another person's dog might be considered an offense unless it's absolutely necessary and proportionate.\n\n6. **Emotional State**: The writer mentions being shaken up and acting in the moment. While emotions can be a factor, it doesn't necessarily negate the possibility of overstepping. However, it's understandable that someone would act impulsively to protect their pet in a life-threatening situation.\n\nPutting this all together, the writer is in a morally gray area. On one hand, they're trying to protect their pet from a dangerous animal. On the other hand, their response involved physical harm to the neighbor's dog and threats that could be seen as excessive. The neighbor's negligence is a key part of the situation, but the writer's actions still could be viewed as problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the use of force and the threats as potentially excessive, then yes, they might be. But if the immediate threat to their pet justifies the defensive actions, then maybe not. However, the threats (calling animal control or killing the dog) likely cross into inappropriate territory regardless of the situation. Legally, the writer might have a defense for the kicking incident if it was to protect their own animal, but the threats could lead to legal trouble. \n\nIn many cases, the appropriate response would be to contact authorities (like animal control) immediately rather than taking matters into one's own hands. The writer's decision to handle it themselves and make threats could be seen as the wrong approach, even if their intention was to protect their pet. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats and possibly excessive force.\n"
