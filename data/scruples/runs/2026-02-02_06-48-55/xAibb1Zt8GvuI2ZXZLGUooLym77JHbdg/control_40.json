They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong after hurting a neighbor's dog.\n\nFirst, the context: The new neighbors have a large dog that jumped their wall twice and attacked the writer's small dog. The first time, the writer physically pulled the dog off. The second time, after the neighbor did nothing to prevent it, the writer kicked the dog to make it release their dog. The neighbor just apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nSo, the key points here are self-defense of their own pet. The writer's dog is much smaller and vulnerable. The neighbor's dog is a mix that's described as beefy and aggressive. The neighbor didn't do anything after the first incident, so the writer felt compelled to act again when the dog attacked a second time.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can protect your own property (which a pet is considered) from immediate harm. If the dog was attacking their pet, using force to stop it might be justified. However, the method used could matter. Kicking a dog might be considered excessive, depending on the circumstances. But given that the dog was holding the writer's dog by the neck, and the writer had to act quickly, kicking to dislodge it might be seen as reasonable.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they didn't take steps to control their dog, maybe the writer feels they had no choice but to act. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be problematic. Threats might escalate the situation, but if the dog is a genuine threat, some might argue it's justified.\n\nEmotionally, the writer is shaken and acted in the moment to protect their pet. People can be protective of their animals, and if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, the writer's actions might be seen as a last resort.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The writer could have tried to contact the neighbor first to discuss the issue, or called authorities instead of handling it themselves. But given the urgency of the attack, immediate action might be necessary. Also, kicking a dog could be seen as violence towards an animal, even if it was in defense of another animal. Some might say that using a tool like a leash or calling animal control is better than physical force.\n\nBut considering the neighbor's inaction and the dog's repeated aggression, the writer might feel justified. The key question is whether their actions were reasonable in the moment to prevent harm to their pet. If the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, the writer might not have felt they had another option.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the writer's actions were to protect their own dog from immediate danger. The neighbor's failure to control their dog also plays a role. Therefore, the writer might not be in the wrong.\n"
