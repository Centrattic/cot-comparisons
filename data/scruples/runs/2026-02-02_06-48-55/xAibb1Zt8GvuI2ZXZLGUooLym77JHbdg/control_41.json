They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is about two neighbors. The author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a bigger dog that's a pitbull/German shepherd mix. The bigger dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's small dog. The first time, the author had to pull the dog off, and the second time, after the neighbor didn't do anything, the author kicked the dog twice to make it let go. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. Now the author is questioning if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you have a duty to protect your animals from harm. If another animal attacks yours, reasonable force to defend your pet might be justified. However, the line between defense and excessive force can be blurry. Kicking the dog twice, especially after it's already bit the author's dog, might be seen as aggressive. But the author might argue it was necessary to save their pet's life.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a factor. If the owner isn't controlling their dog, that's a problem. The neighbor might be negligent if they haven't properly secured their dog or trained it. The author's threats to call animal control or kill the dog are serious, but maybe justified if the dog is a threat. However, threatening to kill someone else's pet could be problematic legally and morally. \n\nThe key points here are: the author acted to protect their dog in an emergency, used what they thought was necessary force, and then made threats. The neighbor didn't take responsibility. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, using force to protect their dog might be understandable, but the threats afterward might be an overreaction. However, given the neighbor's apathy, the author might feel justified. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author was right to act to save their dog, while others might think they went too far with the threats. The neighbor is also at fault for not securing their dog properly. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions were in self-defense of their pet, but the threats might tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. However, the neighbor's negligence also plays a role. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If the answer is about whether the author is the asshole, maybe the community would side with the author given the neighbor's inaction and the immediate threat to their pet. But the kicking might be seen as excessive. Hmm.\n"
