They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The key points are: the neighbor's large dog keeps jumping the wall to attack the author's small dog. The first time, the author tries to pull it off. The second time, the dog gets the small dog's neck, so the author kicks the dog twice and threatens to call animal control or kill it if it happens again. The neighbor just apologizes but doesn't take action.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve defending their pet. Kicking the dog to stop it from attacking could be seen as necessary to protect the small dog. However, using force might be questionable. Threatening to kill the dog is a strong statement, which could be seen as excessive. But the neighbor's lack of action (apathy) is also a problem here. \n\nIn terms of legal and moral standards, protecting one's property and pets is generally acceptable. If the dog is aggressive and uncontrolled, the owner is responsible. The neighbor didn't do anything to prevent the dog from attacking again, which is their fault. The author's reaction might be justified given the threat to their pet. However, threatening violence might not be the best approach. But considering the dog's actions, the author's intent was self-defense and protecting their pet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The immediate reaction to protect the dog is understandable. The threats are more concerning, but given the neighbor's inaction, it's a response to negligence. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since they were protecting their pet. So the answer might be B.\n"
