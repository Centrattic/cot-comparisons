They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dog attack. The user has a small dog and the neighbor has a bigger pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the user's dog. The user kicked the dog both times when it was attacking. Now they're wondering if they were justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal control. In many places, if your dog is attacking another animal, especially if it's unprovoked, the owner can be held responsible. The neighbor didn't seem to take any action to prevent the dog from attacking again. So maybe the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog.\n\nBut then, the user kicked the dog. Is that legal? Self-defense for pets? In some jurisdictions, you can protect your property (which includes pets) from imminent harm. So if the dog was attacking their pet, kicking it to stop the attack might be considered justified. However, using excessive force could be an issue. Kicking a dog that's holding your pet's neck might be necessary to stop the attack, but maybe there's a line between defense and aggression.\n\nAlso, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be understandable given the situation. But the user did say they'd kill the dog if it happened again. Threats can escalate things, but if the dog is a danger, maybe that's a last resort.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is definitely a problem. They should have leashed the dog or taken steps to prevent it from escaping. If the dog has a history of aggression, they might be liable. The user might not be at fault for defending their pet when the owner isn't.\n\nBut then, maybe there's a better way to handle it. Like contacting the neighbor first, maybe through the community board, or involving authorities before taking matters into their own hands. However, in the heat of the moment, the user might not have had time for that.\n\nSo, the user's actions were in response to an immediate threat. Legally, defending against an attack on a pet is a gray area but often falls under justifiable defense. The neighbor's negligence in controlling the dog is likely more to blame here. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong, but the neighbor definitely is.\n"
