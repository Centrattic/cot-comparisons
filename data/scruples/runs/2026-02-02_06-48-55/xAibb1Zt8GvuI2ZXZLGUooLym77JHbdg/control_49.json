They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They described a situation where their neighbor's large dog jumped the wall and attacked their small dog twice. The first time, they pulled the dog off, but the next day, when the dog again attacked and had their dog's neck in its mouth, the author kicked the dog hard to make it let go. They then threatened the neighbor to either call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and to stop trespassing. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. First, the key points: protecting one's property and pets. In many places, you have the right to defend your property and animals from immediate threats. The first incident involved the neighbor's dog trespassing and attacking. The author tried to intervene. The second time, the dog again attacked, and the author used force to separate them. Kicking the dog to protect their own pet could be seen as necessary self-defense for their dog's safety. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might cross a line, depending on local laws. Threats can escalate tensions and may be illegal if not justified. But if the dog is a repeated danger, some might argue the author has a right to take measures to protect their pet. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor; if they didn't control the dog, maybe the author feels justified in taking more aggressive steps. However, the threats could be problematic if they're not proportional or if the author overstepped legal measures. It's a close call. Some might say the author acted in self-defense, while others might think the threats were excessive. The answer hinges on legal and ethical interpretations of self-defense and property rights versus potential threats. Considering that the dog was trespassing and attacking, and the neighbor didn't act, the author's actions might be seen as justified in protecting their own pet, but the specific threats might be the part where they're in the wrong. However, overall, the immediate action to stop the attack could be seen as necessary. So leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B).\n"
