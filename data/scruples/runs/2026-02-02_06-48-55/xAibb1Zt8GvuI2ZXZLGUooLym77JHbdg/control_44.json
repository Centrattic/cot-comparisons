They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking the neighbor's dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the neighbor got a large dog, which is a mix of pitbull and German Shepherd. The writer has a small dog that's vulnerable. The first incident, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks. The writer then intervenes, but when the dog does it again the next day, the writer kicks it to get it off their small dog.\n\nThe key points here are the immediate threat to the small dog, the neighbor's response, and the writer's actions. When the dog attacks again the next day, the writer kicks it. Now, self-defense for one's pet is a factor here. But the question is whether the writer's actions were justified.\n\nIn many legal systems, you have a duty to prevent harm to your property or animals. If the neighbor's dog is uncontrolled and poses a threat, the owner might be liable. However, using force against someone else's property (the dog) can be a gray area. Kicking the dog might be considered excessive force unless it's necessary to prevent immediate harm. The writer might have had a right to protect their dog, but the method used could be questioned. Also, threatening to kill the dog might be overstepping, depending on local laws.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is another point. If they didn't take steps to control their dog after the first incident, that's their fault. But the writer's threat to kill the dog could be seen as vigilantism. However, if the dog is a repeated threat, the writer might have a case for taking action to protect their pet.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer could have called animal control instead of handling it themselves. But in a split-second to protect their dog from being killed, kicking might be seen as a reasonable reaction. The neighbor's lack of action to secure their dog is definitely a problem. The writer's threats might not be the best approach, but the immediate action to protect the dog might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's actions might be understandable in the moment, but the threats after could be problematic. However, the main issue is the neighbor's responsibility. The writer is in a tough spot. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they acted to protect their pet from an immediate threat. The kicking was to stop an attack, which is a self-defense scenario for the animal. The threats are a bit strong, but given the neighbor's inaction, maybe it's understandable. So, the main thing is that the writer's actions were in defense of their dog, so not in the wrong.\n"
