They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe person has a small dog, a mix of Chihuahua and Miniature Pinscher. The neighbor got a big pitbull/German Shepherd mix, which they think is a guard dog. The first time, the neighbor's dog, Beef Boy, jumped the wall and attacked their dog. The person pulled it off, closed the door, and the neighbor took the dog back. The next day, the same thing happened. This time, the neighbor's dog had the person's dog by the neck, so they kicked the neighbor's dog. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The author is now worried they overreacted and is asking if they're the asshole (ITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The neighbor's dog attacking twice is concerning. The first time, the person intervened physically to stop the attack. The second time, the dog was more aggressive, so they kicked it. The neighbor didn't seem to address the issue, just apologizing without taking responsibility or preventing future incidents.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the neighbor's dog is a threat, the owner is responsible for controlling it. Propping up a fence or leash might be necessary. The author tried to protect their dog, which is a pet they care for. Kicking the dog to stop it from attacking their pet might be seen as a reasonable action in self-defense, considering the immediate danger to their smaller dog.\n\nHowever, there are nuances. The author threatened to kill the dog if it happened again, which is a strong statement. While understandable due to fear, making such a threat could lead to legal issues. But in the context of protecting a pet from an aggressive dog, it might be considered a justified stand due to the neighbor's inaction.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem too. They didn't take steps to prevent the dog from escaping, which is their responsibility. The author's response was in reaction to the neighbor's failure to control the dog. The key point is the immediate need to protect their dog from harm. Kicking the dog stopped the attack, which is a direct action to prevent injury. The threats, while harsh, come from frustration and fear. The neighbor isn't taking responsibility, so the author might feel compelled to escalate to protect their pet.\n\nIn many places, laws protect the right to defend property and pets, but the methods can vary. Kicking the dog might be within the bounds of self-defense for a pet, but it's a judgment call. The neighbor's lack of action makes their part in this situation questionable. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their dog, especially with the neighbor's negligence.\n"
