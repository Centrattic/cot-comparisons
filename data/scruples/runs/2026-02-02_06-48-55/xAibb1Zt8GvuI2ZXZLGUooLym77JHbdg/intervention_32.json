They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors with dogs, and the author of the story kicked the neighbor's dog after it attacked their own dog twice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The neighbor's dog, a large mix, jumped the wall twice and attacked the smaller dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog had the author's dog by the neck, the author kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't seem to take further action. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense and the justification of actions. In most jurisdictions, you have the right to protect your property and your pets. However, the method used to do so might matter. Kicking a dog could be considered excessive force if it's not necessary to prevent harm. Alternatively, if the dog is actively attacking, some might argue it's necessary to stop it.\n\nBut then there's the threat part. Threatening to kill someone else's animal is a serious matter. Even if the dog is a threat, making such a threat could be problematic. The author might be justified in feeling upset, but the response could be seen as over the line. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility is a factor. If they knew their dog was prone to attack and didn't keep it under control, they might be at fault. But the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014could be seen as retaliatory and possibly illegal, depending on the laws where they live.\n\nI should also think about animal cruelty laws. Kicking an animal might be considered cruelty, even in self-defense. The author might be protecting their own pet, but using force that causes harm to another's animal could have legal consequences. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is mentioned, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. The author's response, while understandable given the stress, might not be the legally or ethically acceptable way to handle it. They should have perhaps documented the incidents, contacted the neighbor formally, or called authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as justified in the moment to protect their own dog, but the physical retaliation and threats could place them in the wrong legally and morally. The use of force and threats might not be the appropriate response, even if the neighbor is at fault for their dog's behavior.\n"
