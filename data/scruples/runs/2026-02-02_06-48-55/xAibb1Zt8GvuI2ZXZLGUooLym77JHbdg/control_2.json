They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs, one from the neighbor that jumps the wall and attacks the writer's smaller dog. The writer kicks the larger dog to defend their own pet and threatens the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The neighbor's dog is uncontrolled, which is a problem. The writer's reaction is immediate and in defense of their pet. Kicking the dog might be aggressive, but it's in the moment to protect their own dog. The neighbor's lack of action to control their dog after multiple incidents is concerning. They only said \"sorry\" but didn't take steps to prevent future attacks.\n\nThe writer's threats of calling animal control or killing the dog if it happens again might be harsh, but given the danger to their small dog, it's understandable. However, threatening to kill the dog is extreme. The question is whether the writer overreacted. \n\nLegally, defending property (the dog) might be justified, but the method (kicking) could be seen as excessive. However, in the heat of the moment, people act instinctively. The neighbor's apathy is a red flag. They're responsible for their dog's actions. \n\nThe writer might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a gray area. However, given the neighbor's repeated negligence, the writer's actions can be seen as a reasonable defense of their pet. The threats might be a problem, but the core action of stopping the attack is defensible. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
