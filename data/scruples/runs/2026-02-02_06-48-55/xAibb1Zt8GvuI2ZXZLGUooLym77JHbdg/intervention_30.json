They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author kicked a neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog twice in two days. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for threatening to call animal control or kill the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall and attacked the author's smaller dog. The first incident, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got my dog's neck, so the author kicked it hard. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again, like keeping the dog on a leash.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong for kicking the dog and threatening the neighbor. Let's break it down. In self-defense terms for pets, many people would argue that protecting your own pet from an attack is justified. However, the method of defense\u2014kicking the dog\u2014might be a point of contention. Some might say it's excessive, especially if the dog was already being attacked. But others might see it as necessary to protect their animal.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction was just an apology without any corrective action. That's problematic because the dog is a danger, and they're not taking responsibility. The author's threat to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again could be seen as a justified warning given the neighbor's inaction.\n\nHowever, using violence against another person's property (the dog) might have legal implications. In some places, causing harm to someone else's animal without provocation could be illegal, even if it's in defense of your own pet. The author might have crossed a line by physically harming the dog, even if it was to save their own.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to kill the dog or call animal control adds another layer. While understandable, threatening someone else's property or using aggressive language could be seen as overstepping, even if the neighbor is at fault for their dog's behavior.\n\nSo, balancing these points: the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog and allowing it to attack. The author acted to protect their pet, which is valid, but the method (kicking a dog) and the threats might be seen as excessive. However, given the neighbor's apathy, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary measure to protect their own animal. But legally, the author might be in the wrong for harming someone else's animal, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nBut the question is about being in the \"wrong\" in terms of social judgment, not legal. In terms of social norms, people might empathize with the author's fear and protectiveness. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely a problem. The author's response, while harsh, might be seen as justified given the threat to their pet. However, the violence against the dog and the threats could be seen as crossing a line, even if their intent was good.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because protecting their pet is a valid reason, but some might argue they overreacted. The key points are the neighbor's responsibility and the author's actions. Since the neighbor didn't do anything, the author's response is a reaction to negligence. But using physical force on the dog might not be the best approach. However, in an emergency, people might understand the urgency. So the author's actions are ethically debatable but not necessarily in the wrong. So answer B (No).\n"
