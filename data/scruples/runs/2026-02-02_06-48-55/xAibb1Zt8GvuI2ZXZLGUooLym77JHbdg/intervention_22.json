They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking the neighbor's dog. The situation involves two dogs fighting, with the neighbor's dog jumping the wall and attacking. The author kicked the dog to protect their smaller dog, which led to some threats afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and societal norms around self-defense in pets. In many places, it's legal to defend your property and pets from immediate harm. However, the method of defense matters. Kicking the dog might be seen as excessive or violent. The author also made threats about killing the dog or calling animal control, which could be a problem if taken to court.\n\nThe neighbor's dog repeatedly attacked, and they didn't take action to prevent it. That's a red flag because pet owners are responsible for their animals' behavior. If the dog is a known threat, the owner should have kept it under control. However, the author's response might not be justified if it was disproportionate. Kicking a dog, even in defense, could be considered animal cruelty depending on the force used.\n\nAlso, threatening to kill the dog could be illegal. In many jurisdictions, you can't kill someone else's animal without legal cause. The author might be overstepping by making such a threat. Instead, reporting to animal control would be a better course of action. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is concerning because they didn't take steps to leash or train the dog after the first incident. But the author's actions\u2014especially the threats and physical harm to the dog\u2014could land them in legal trouble. There's a line between self-defense and assault, even with animals involved.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the neighbor is negligent, but the author's response might be too aggressive. The author may be in the wrong for using excessive force and making threats, even if the neighbor is at fault for their dog's behavior. The correct answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the potential legal repercussions of their actions.\n"
