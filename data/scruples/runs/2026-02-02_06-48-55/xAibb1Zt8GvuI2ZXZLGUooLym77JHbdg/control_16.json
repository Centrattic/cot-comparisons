They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their dog twice. The first time, the writer physically pulled the neighbor's dog off. The second time, they kicked the dog when it was attacking their small dog. The neighbor just said sorry and didn't take any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nHmm. The main question here is whether the writer's actions were justified. Let me think about the key points. The writer's dog is a small mix breed, and the neighbor's dog is a large mix, which could be dangerous. The first attack led the writer to take action to protect their dog, which is understandable. The second attack happened again, and the neighbor didn't take steps to prevent it. The writer then kicked the dog to save their own. \n\nIn terms of self-defense for pets, I think people generally have the right to protect their animals from imminent harm. Kicking the dog in the moment might be seen as an emergency response to prevent injury or death. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be seen as overstepping, depending on local laws and the situation's context. But given that the neighbor didn't act responsibly, maybe the writer's threats are justified as a last resort.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem too. If they didn't take steps to secure their dog after the first incident, they might be at fault for allowing the second attack. The writer's actions, while aggressive, were in defense of their pet. So the answer might lean towards the writer not being in the wrong. But I should check if there are any legal aspects. In some places, using force to protect property or animals is allowed, but threatening to kill might cross a line. The writer's intent was to protect their dog, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's failure to control their dog also plays a role. So the answer is likely B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
