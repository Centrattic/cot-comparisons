They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's dog repeatedly attacking their dog, and the writer responding by kicking the dog and threatening further action if it happens again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large breed (pitbull/shepherd mix) that has jumped the wall twice to attack the writer's smaller dog. The first time, the writer physically pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog attacked again, the writer kicked it to make it release their dog. The neighbor expressed regret but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents, like keeping the dog on a leash or securing their yard better.\n\nNow, the key points are: self-defense of a pet, the neighbor's responsibility, and the writer's actions. In many places, there are laws about protecting property and pets. If a dog is unprovoked and attacking, the owner might have a duty to control it. However, the line between defense and aggression can be thin. Kicking another person's dog, even in defense, might be seen as excessive, depending on the circumstances. Also, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be problematic if not justified under local laws.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a red flag. If they're not taking steps to prevent their dog from being a danger, that's their fault. But the writer's response\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014might cross into vigilantism. Depending on the jurisdiction, they might have legal recourse through authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands. However, the immediate threat to their own pet could be seen as justifying defensive actions, especially if the neighbor isn't acting responsibly.\n\nSo, the writer's actions might be understandable due to the immediate danger to their dog, but threatening violence or death could be excessive. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely part of the problem. The writer's use of force might be justified in the moment to protect their pet, but the threats afterward might not be. Legally, it's a gray area, but morally, the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The writer's reaction could be seen as self-defense, but the threats might escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor is definitely negligent, the writer's response might be seen as over the line in terms of threats, but the physical defense might be excusable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Their actions could be considered justified in protecting their pet, but the threats might not be. It's a balance between defending one's property and using excessive force. I think the main issue is the neighbor's responsibility, but the author's method of handling it might not be entirely right. So, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because of the threats and potential excessive force, but some might argue B because of the neighbor's negligence.\n"
