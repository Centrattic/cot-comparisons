They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's dog jumping the wall and attacking their smaller dog. The author kicked the dog twice to get it off and then threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, you're allowed to defend your property and pets, but there are limits. Kicking a dog, even in self-defense or to protect a pet, might be considered excessive. Also, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic, as they might have legal recourse. The neighbor's inaction is also an issue, but the author's response might be seen as over the top.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's dog is small and vulnerable. The neighbor's dog is large and aggressive. The author felt they had to act to protect their pet, which is understandable. But using force that caused injury to the neighbor's dog and making threats could be seen as wrong. The neighbor might have a case if the dog was injured, depending on local laws. Also, threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious threat and not a legal solution.\n\nThe author's actions might be justified in the heat of the moment, but the threats afterward could be problematic. Legally, self-defense usually involves proportionality. Kicking the dog twice might be considered a reasonable action to stop an immediate threat, but the threats to kill or call animal control could be seen as intimidation. The neighbor's apathy is their problem, but the author's response might not be the best approach. Maybe they should have documented the incidents and contacted the authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because their response was excessive and included threats. Even if the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the author's actions crossed a line into violence and intimidation. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if self-defense or protecting a pet justifies it. However, kicking the dog and making threats are probably not the best course of action legally or ethically.\n"
