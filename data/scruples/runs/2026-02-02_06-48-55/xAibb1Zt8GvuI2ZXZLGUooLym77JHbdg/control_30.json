They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their neighbor's dog repeatedly attacking their own dog, and the author took action by kicking the dog when it was attacking their pet. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's dog is larger. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, once leading to their dog almost being attacked and then the next day, the dog actually had the author's dog by the neck. The author then kicked the dog to stop it, and later threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. The neighbor's response was just an apology without any action.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense of their pet. In many jurisdictions, you have the right to protect your property and pets from imminent harm. The author's actions seem to be a direct response to their pet being in danger. However, the method of response might be questionable. Kicking a dog, even in defense, could be seen as excessive force depending on the circumstances. But if the dog was actively attacking, then maybe it's justified.\n\nAnother angle is the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor got a large dog and didn't take proper measures to confine it, leading to the attacks. Their inaction after being informed is problematic. The author's threats, while strong, might be a reaction to the neighbor's negligence. However, threatening to kill the dog could be a legal issue, depending on local laws. But the immediate action of kicking the dog during an attack is more about protecting their pet.\n\nThe author's response to the neighbor was to state their intentions if it happened again. That's a form of self-defense and asserting boundaries. However, making direct threats like \"kill it\" might not be the best approach legally, but given the situation, it's understandable given the stress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author was protecting their dog from a clear threat. The neighbor's negligence and lack of action contributed to the problem. The author's actions were in defense of their pet. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
