They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a neighbor's dog attacking their dog twice, and the author reacting by kicking the dog and threatening the owner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's dog is a large breed that jumped the wall twice to attack. The first time, the author tried to pull it off. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so they kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nLegally, in many places, you have a duty to prevent harm to your property and animals. If the neighbor's dog is a known danger, the owner is responsible. The author's actions to protect their own dog might be justified as self-defense for their pet. Kicking the dog in the moment to stop an attack could be seen as a reasonable response to prevent injury.\n\nHowever, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might cross a line. While the author had a right to protect their pet, making threats could escalate the situation. The neighbor's apathy is concerning, as they should have better controlled their dog. The author's response was in a crisis moment, so their actions can be understood, but the threats might be problematic.\n\nEmotionally, the author was clearly shaken and acted out of fear for their pet's safety. The neighbor's lack of follow-up also contributed to the tension. So while the physical action might be justified, the threats could be seen as overreacting. But the main issue is the neighbor's responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong, but their response could be seen as necessary given the circumstances. The key is whether the force used was reasonable. Kicking to stop an attack could be acceptable, but threats might not be. However, in the heat of the moment, it's a split-second decision. So overall, the author probably isn't in the wrong, but the answer might depend on local laws and cultural expectations.\n"
