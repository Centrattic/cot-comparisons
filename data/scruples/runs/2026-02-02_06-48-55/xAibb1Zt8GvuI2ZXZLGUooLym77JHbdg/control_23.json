They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their smaller dog twice, and the author responding by kicking the dog and threatening to kill it if it happened again. The neighbor didn't take any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a small dog that's vulnerable. The neighbor's dog is larger and jumped the wall twice, attacking the author's dog both times. The first time, the author physically pulled the dog off. The second time, they kicked it to make it let go. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take measures to prevent future incidents.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense and the response to a threat. In many jurisdictions, you're allowed to defend your property and pets, but the response must be proportional. Kicking a dog that's attacking your pet might be considered excessive. However, given the situation where their dog was in the process of attacking and the owner wasn't intervening, the author might feel that immediate action was necessary to protect their pet.\n\nThreatening to kill the dog is more problematic. While it's understandable to be upset, making such a threat could be seen as violent. However, if the neighbor's dog is a known danger and they're not taking responsibility, the author might feel justified in making a threat to ensure their own and their pet's safety. The neighbor's inaction is definitely a contributing factor here.\n\nThe neighbor's apology without taking corrective actions (like keeping the dog on a leash, using a fence, or training) adds to the frustration. The author might feel that the neighbor isn't taking the problem seriously, which could justify their response in their eyes.\n\nHowever, from a legal standpoint, using force against an animal, even in self-defense, can be tricky. Kicking could be considered animal cruelty if it's excessive. Also, threatening to kill the dog might not be legally justified unless there's a clear and present danger. The author's actions might be seen as overreacting, especially if they used more force than necessary.\n\nBut considering the emotional state after the second attack, the author's fear for their pet's life is understandable. The neighbor's apathy likely pushed them to take more drastic measures. The main issue here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be acceptable, but threatening to kill it each time could be crossing a line unless there's a legal basis for that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor is definitely at fault for not controlling their dog and being apathetic, the author's actions might be seen as justified in the moment out of self-defense. However, the threats might be considered excessive. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. The answer is B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
