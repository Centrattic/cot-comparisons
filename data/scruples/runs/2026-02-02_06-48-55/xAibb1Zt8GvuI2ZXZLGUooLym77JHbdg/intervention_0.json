They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their pet twice, and the author reacting by kicking the dog and threatening further action.\n\nFirst, the author's dog was attacked twice by the neighbor's large dog. The first time, they physically pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog was attacking again, they kicked the dog twice. Then they threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again, and also mentioned doing something about the neighbor if they trespassed on the lawn.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, protecting one's property and pets is generally acceptable. If a dog is attacking, it's reasonable to intervene to stop the attack. However, using force against another person's dog could have legal repercussions. The author kicked the dog, which might be considered animal cruelty depending on the circumstances. The neighbor's dog was off-leash and trespassing, which is a problem, but the author's response of threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as excessive. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor here. They didn't take steps to prevent the attacks, which is negligent. The author felt justified in their actions because their small dog was in danger. However, threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious action and might not be justified even in self-defense. The best course of action would have been to contact the neighbor first, maybe file a complaint, or involve authorities. \n\nBut given the immediate threat to their own dog's life, the author's actions could be seen as self-defense. However, the threats might still be problematic. So there's a balance here. The answer might depend on local laws regarding pet protection and property rights. Since the user is asking for a judgment, and the options are A or B, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the author's immediate actions to protect their dog were justified, especially in an emergency. But the threats after the fact might be overstepping. However, the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog is also a key point. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their property. So maybe B (not in the wrong).\n"
