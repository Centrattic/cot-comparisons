They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a small dog, and the neighbor got a large, potentially dangerous dog. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off. The second time, when the dog had the author's dog by the neck, the author kicked the neighbor's dog. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatened the neighbor about calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, animal control laws allow for self-defense for pets. If a dog is attacking another animal, the owner might have the right to protect their pet. However, using force like kicking could be seen as excessive if it resulted in injury to the neighbor's dog. The threat to \"kill\" the dog is more concerning because it's a direct threat against another person's property, which could have legal repercussions. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor\u2014if they're not taking measures to control their dog, they could be at fault as well.\n\nBut the key points here are: Was the author's response proportionate? Kicking the dog in the moment might be justified to stop an attack, especially if it was an emergency. However, making threats afterward, like calling animal control or killing the dog, might cross into threatening behavior. The neighbor's failure to control their dog is definitely a problem, but the author's threats could be seen as overstepping, even if justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's a bit of a grey area. The author acted to protect their pet, which is understandable. But the threats and the method of handling the situation (kicking the dog) could be problematic. However, in a panic during an attack, instinct might lead someone to act without thinking about proportionality. The neighbor's lack of action also plays a role here. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong, their threats and the method of defense might make them partially at fault. But since the main issue is the neighbor's dog being a danger and their inaction, maybe the author isn't the sole asshole. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because they acted in self-defense, but the threats might tip it. Alternatively, if the kicking was necessary, but the threats are the problem. Hmm.\n"
