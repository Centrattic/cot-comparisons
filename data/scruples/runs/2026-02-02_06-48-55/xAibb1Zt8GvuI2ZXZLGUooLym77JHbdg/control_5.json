They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation involves two dogs, with the neighbor's dog (Beef Boy) attacking the author's small dog twice. The author kicked the dog both times, and threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal defense. In many places, if your animal is in danger, you can take reasonable steps to protect it. Kicking the dog to defend your pet might be seen as necessary if it's an immediate threat. However, if there was an opportunity to do something else, like calling the police or using a leash, that might be considered more appropriate.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a factor too. They didn't take steps to control their dog, which is a problem. The neighbor's dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked the smaller dog. The neighbor only apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. That shows negligence on their part.\n\nThe author's reaction: hitting the dog, threatening to kill it, and confronting the neighbor. While the author's intent was to protect their pet, the use of force might be seen as reasonable in the moment. However, threatening to kill someone's dog could be problematic, unless there are specific laws allowing that. Also, trespassing by the neighbor is another issue. The neighbor jumped over the wall, which is their responsibility.\n\nBut does the author have the right to harm another person's property (the dog)? In some jurisdictions, you can't just harm an animal, even if it's attacking your pet. There are usually procedures: first, try to separate the animals safely, then contact authorities. If the author used excessive force, they might be liable for damages.\n\nThe neighbor's failure to control the dog is definitely part of the problem. They should have leashed the dog or kept it in their own yard. However, the author's response of threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be within their rights, depending on local laws. But actually kicking the dog might be seen as taking the law into their own hands.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is clearly at fault for not controlling their dog, the author's actions might cross a line. The use of force without first trying to contact authorities could be an issue. The author might be justified in protecting their pet, but the method and threats could make them legally liable. So the answer depends on the specific laws, but there's a chance the author is also at fault.\n"
