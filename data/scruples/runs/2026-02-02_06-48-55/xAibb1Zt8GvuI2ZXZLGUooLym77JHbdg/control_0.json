They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors: one has a small dog, and the other has a larger dog that jumped the wall and attacked. The writer kicked the larger dog to save their own, then threatened the neighbor if it happened again. They're wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer's dog is a small mix, which is vulnerable. The neighbor's dog is a large mix, which could indeed pose a serious threat. The first incident led to the neighbor's dog attacking, and the second time, the writer acted to protect their pet. The neighbor's response was just an apology without taking steps to prevent future issues.\n\nIn terms of self-defense for pets, there's a line between protecting your animal and using excessive force. Kicking the dog might be seen as a reasonable reaction in the moment to stop an attack, especially if the writer believed their dog was in immediate danger. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be seen as overstepping, even if the motivation is protection.\n\nThe neighbor's lack of action is also a factor. If they didn't take measures to control their dog, like keeping it leashed or securing the fence, they share responsibility. But the writer's threats might come across as aggressive, which could make others think the writer is the asshole. \n\nLegally, using force to protect property (like a pet) is sometimes justified, but it depends on local laws. If the writer's actions were necessary to prevent harm, they might have a valid defense. However, the threats of violence or killing someone else's pet could lead to legal issues if taken to court.\n\nEmotionally, the writer is shaken and acted in a panic. People can be forgiven for overreacting in stressful situations, but it's still important to consider how their actions are perceived. The neighbor's apathy is also a problem, but the writer's approach might not be the best way to resolve it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intentions to protect their dog are understandable, the method of response\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014might be seen as over the top. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be questioned. However, given the neighbor's negligence, the writer's actions are somewhat justified. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
