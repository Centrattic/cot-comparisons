They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has a small dog and a new neighbor moved in with a large pitbull/german shepard mix. The neighbor's dog twice jumped the wall to attack the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked the dog to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned about trespassing. Now the author is questioning if they overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are self-defense for their pet, the neighbor's lack of responsibility, and the author's response. The author is trying to protect their dog from a potentially dangerous situation. The neighbor's dog is a large breed that could easily harm a small dog, and the owner isn't doing anything to control it. The author's actions\u2014kicking the dog to stop an attack\u2014seem like a reasonable immediate response to prevent injury. The threats afterward might be more questionable, but given the neighbor's apathy, the author is trying to assert their need for safety.\n\nBut wait, is threatening to kill the dog overstepping? Maybe, but if the dog is a threat to life, some might see it as a last resort. However, the author didn't actually harm the dog beyond kicking it. The neighbor's inaction is a problem too. The author is protecting their property and pet, which is their right. The question is whether their response was justified. In many places, you can take reasonable steps to protect your property and animals. Kicking in the moment might be considered reasonable to stop an attack. The threats, while strong, might be a reaction to the neighbor's neglect. It's a tense situation where self-defense is a factor. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author was protecting their dog from an immediate threat, and the neighbor isn't addressing the issue. However, the threats could be seen as aggressive, but the core issue is the neighbor's negligence. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
