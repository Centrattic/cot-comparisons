They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after they kicked their neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog. \n\nFirst, the context: The neighbor got a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix, which jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's small dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the second time, they kicked it when they saw it had the dog's neck. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about the dog trespassing.\n\nSo, the main points here are the actions taken by the author. The first time, they physically pulled the dog off. The second time, they kicked it. Then they made threats. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, animal attacks can be dangerous, especially for a smaller dog. The neighbor's dog is large and aggressive, which could be a valid concern. The author tried to stop the attack to protect their pet. However, the method they used the second time was kicking the dog. Even if it was in defense of their own dog, using force that could harm the neighbor's dog might be an issue. Also, the threats made afterward could be problematic because threatening to kill someone's pet or involve animal control might be seen as escalating the situation.\n\nBut then, the neighbor's responsibility is also important. They allowed the dog to escape twice and didn't take measures to prevent it. The author might feel their own dog's safety is at risk. If the dog was untrained or not properly contained, the neighbor could be at fault for not securing their pet.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, using reasonable force to protect one's property (in this case, their dog) might be justified. However, the line is blurry. Kicking another person's dog, even if it's in the act of attacking, could be seen as excessive. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a serious threat and could have legal repercussions, depending on the jurisdiction. It's possible that the neighbor's inaction is a bigger issue, but the author's response might be considered too harsh.\n\nThe author might have been in a panic situation, but their threats could be viewed as overreacting. The neighbor's apathy is definitely a problem, but the author's actions might cross into being aggressive themselves. So, I'm torn. On one hand, the neighbor is responsible for their dog's safety. On the other, the author's response might be too much. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if protecting their own dog, using physical violence on the neighbor's dog and making threats could be seen as not the appropriate way to handle the situation. They should have taken other steps first, like talking to the neighbor, ensuring the dog is leashed or contained, and maybe contacting animal control themselves if necessary. Threatening to harm or kill the dog is a red line that might make the author the asshole here.\n"
