They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the small one. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the author's dog by the neck, and the author kicked the neighbor's dog to get it off. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The neighbor's dog is a known danger because it's large and has attacked before. The owner didn't take steps to secure the dog, like keeping it on a leash or fixing the fence. The author acted to protect their own dog, which is a natural instinct. Kicking the dog might be a bit harsh, but given the immediate threat to their small pet, it's understandable. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor here; they didn't do anything to prevent the second attack.\n\nBut wait, is using force on another person's dog acceptable? In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be a legal gray area. But considering the dog's history and the owner's lack of action, the author might feel justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered legal avenues first, like talking to the owner about the fence or contacting animal control. But given the urgency of the situation, the immediate action might be seen as necessary. The neighbor's inaction is also a big part of the problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author was trying to protect their pet from a real threat. The neighbor's dog is dangerous, and the owner isn't responsible. The author's actions, while possibly a bit forceful, were in defense of their own animal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
