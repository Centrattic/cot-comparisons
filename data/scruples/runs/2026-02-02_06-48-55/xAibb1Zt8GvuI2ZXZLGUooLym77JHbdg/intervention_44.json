They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong after hurting their neighbor's dog. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has a small dog and a new neighbor with a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked their small dog. The first time, the AITA pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog attacked again, and the AITA kicked it to make it let go. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. The AITA then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned about trespassing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the AITA is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's dog is a danger to the AITA's dog. The dog's behavior is aggressive, attacking twice. The AITA's actions were to protect their own pet. In the first incident, they physically separated the dogs. In the second, they kicked the dog to get it to release. That's a reasonable defensive action to prevent injury to their own dog. However, kicking the dog could be seen as excessive. Depending on the situation, using force to protect one's property or pets might be justified, but the method might matter. Kicking could cause injury to the dog, which might be a problem. But if the dog was actively attacking their small dog, which could be fatal, the AITA's actions might be seen as necessary.\n\nThen there's the threat part. After the second incident, the AITA told the neighbor they would kill the dog or call animal control if it happened again. Threats of violence, even towards an animal, can be legally problematic. In many places, threatening to harm someone's property (the dog) could have legal consequences, even if the intent is to protect one's own property. The AITA might have overstepped here by making explicit threats, which could be seen as provocative or threatening the neighbor's property rights.\n\nBut the neighbor's role is also in question. They got a large dog and didn't take sufficient precautions. Letting the dog jump the wall and attack another dog without control is negligent. The neighbor's apathy in not addressing the dog's behavior, like keeping it on a leash or muzzled, could be seen as the real issue. The neighbor's dog is a danger to others, and they didn't take responsibility, which contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the AITA's actions to protect their dog were in response to immediate danger. The kicking might be a bit harsh, but it was to stop an attack. However, the threats afterward could be problematic. The neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog is a significant factor. Legally, using reasonable force to protect one's property (the dog) might be justified, but threatening to kill someone else's dog without due process could be an issue. The AITA might not be the sole asshole here, but maybe not entirely in the wrong either. The neighbor is certainly at fault for the dog's behavior and lack of control. But the AITA's response, especially the threats, might cross the line. However, given the context, the AITA's actions were driven by fear and protection of their pet. So, is the AITA in the wrong? The kicking might be justified, but the threats could be the issue. Since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide. If the main question is whether the AITA is in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) because of the threats, but maybe B (no) because of the context. But different perspectives: in some places, threatening harm without due process is problematic. However, given the neighbor's negligence, the AITA's actions might be seen as defensive. I'm leaning towards the AITA is not in the wrong because their actions were in self-defense for their pet, even if the threats were ill-advised. But the threats could make them at fault. Hmm. It's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the threats are considered a breach of acceptable conduct. If the AITA had just taken legal action (calling animal control) instead of making threats, they'd be in a better position. Since they made threats, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the neighbor is negligent, the AITA's response is understandable. I think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the threats are problematic, even if the initial actions were defensive. However, if the answer is B, considering the neighbor's fault, then maybe not. I need to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the two incidents where the dog attacked, and the author's response. The kicking might be excessive, but under the circumstances, it's understandable. The threats, though, are more of an issue. Threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious matter. So the answer is A. But maybe not. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to form my own opinion. In legal terms, using reasonable force to protect one's property is allowed. If the dog was about to cause harm, using force to stop it is justified. However, kicking the dog might not be considered \"reasonable\" in some jurisdictions. Also, the threats after could be seen as harassment. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for the threats. Therefore, answer A.\n"
