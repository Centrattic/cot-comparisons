They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the author responding by threatening the neighbor and their dog. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice, attacking. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got hold of the small dog's neck, so the author kicked it. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, considering legality and ethics. In many places, you can protect your property from immediate harm. The first attack: pulling the dog off is probably justified. The second attack: the dog is on the author's property and attacking their pet. The author used physical force (kicking) to stop the attack. That might be self-defense for the pet. But kicking a dog, even in the heat of the moment, could be seen as excessive? Or maybe not if the dog is actively harming another animal.\n\nHowever, the author then threatens to kill the dog or call animal control. Threatening someone's pet might be crossing a line. While the neighbor's apathy is frustrating, making such threats could be illegal or at least morally questionable. The author might be justified in protecting their dog, but the threats might be over the top.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility: they should have kept their dog under control, maybe with a leash or better training. If the dog is a danger, the neighbor could be at fault. But the author's response of threatening to kill the dog could lead to legal issues, even if the neighbor is negligent.\n\nSo, the author's actions in the moment to stop the attack might be defensible. The threat afterward is where they might be in the wrong. But maybe the context of imminent danger and their emotional state (shaken) complicates that.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the threats are considered excessive or illegal. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, the options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's actions to protect their dog are understandable, but the threats might make them the asshole. However, if the threats were made in self-defense and to prevent future harm, it's debatable.\n\nI think the key is that while the initial defense was okay, the threats could be problematic. So the author might be in the wrong for the threats, but not for the physical action. But the question is whether they're in the wrong overall. Since they did physically attack the dog, maybe that's also questionable. But in the moment, it's hard to say. Maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the neighbor's negligence is worse. Hmm.\n"
