They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about their actions towards their neighbor's dog and the neighbor's response.\n\nFirst, the author has a small dog that's vulnerable. The neighbor's large dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked. The first time, they pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog had the author's dog by the neck, the author kicked the neighbor's dog to get it off. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and also mentioned confronting the neighbor if the dog trespassed again.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) The author physically harmed the neighbor's dog, and 2) The author made threats towards the dog and the neighbor. \n\nLegally, in many places, you can defend your property, including pets, but the response has to be reasonable. Kicking a dog to protect your own might be considered justified if it's an immediate threat. However, making threats to kill the dog or call animal control could be a problem, especially if there's no prior warning beyond that. The neighbor might have legal recourse if the author harmed their dog, depending on local laws. Also, threatening violence might be a legal issue regardless of the justification.\n\nEthically, the author was trying to protect their pet, which is understandable. But the threats could be seen as excessive. The neighbor didn't seem to take the issue seriously, just apologizing without taking action like leashing the dog. The author's threats might be a response to that negligence. However, threatening to kill the dog is a strong action and might not be advisable, even if the neighbor was at fault.\n\nFrom a community standpoint, the author could have tried other steps first, like talking to the neighbor more firmly, contacting animal control before taking matters into their own hands, or even using a barrier. But given the immediate threat to their small dog, the author might feel like they had no choice in the moment.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because protecting their pet is a valid concern. But their response might have crossed a line with the threats. However, the neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog and being apathetic. The question is whether the author's actions (kicking the dog and threats) are justified. \n\nIn many places, using reasonable force to protect one's property or pets is allowed, but the threats might not be. Kicking the dog in the moment could be considered a reasonable defensive action. The threats to kill the dog or call animal control might be more problematic because they were made after the fact and could be seen as intimidation. \n\nSo, balancing all this, the author might have a point in wanting to protect their pet, but the threats and possible harm to the dog could make them partially at fault. However, since the neighbor was negligent, the author's actions could be seen as a response to that negligence. It's a bit of a grey area. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author acted in self-defense for their pet and the neighbor's lack of action, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The actual answer could depend on local laws and context not provided. But based on general principles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
