They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, leading to the author kicking the dog to save theirs. The neighbor seems apologetic but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's dog was in danger, and they took action to protect it. The first time, they pulled the dog off, and the second time, they kicked it. The neighbor only said sorry but didn't take measures like keeping the dog on a leash.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral considerations, self-defense for pets is a gray area. Some places have laws about defending your property, including pets. The author's actions were in the moment to protect their dog, which is understandable. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as over the top. But given the repeated incidents and the neighbor's inaction, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem too. If the dog is a danger, the owner should have taken responsibility. The author's reaction could be seen as a last resort after the neighbor didn't act. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but their threats could be seen as harsh. However, under the stress and fear for their pet's safety, their actions are somewhat understandable.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their pet from immediate harm, and the neighbor didn't take necessary precautions. The threats might be strong, but the context justifies them."
