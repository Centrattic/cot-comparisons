They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves two dogs, one from the author's side and one from the neighbor's. The neighbor's dog (Beef Boy) jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's smaller dog. The author kicked the dog to defend their pet and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, you can protect your property with reasonable force. The author's dog is their property, and if another dog is attacking it, using force to defend it might be justified. However, using a kick could be seen as excessive. Kicking a dog might be considered animal cruelty depending on local laws. But the neighbor's dog was the aggressor here, so the author's action could be in self-defense for their pet.\n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor got a large dog that's not leashed and it's causing problems. The neighbor seemed apathetic after the second incident, only apologizing but not taking action to restrain their dog. That's a problem because pet owners are usually responsible for their pets' actions. If the dog is a known aggressor, the owner should take steps to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe author's threat to call animal control or kill the dog might be a strong reaction, but given the danger to their small dog, it could be seen as a reasonable warning. The neighbor's inaction might justify the author feeling the need to take more drastic measures. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog could have legal repercussions. It's a line that's crossed into potentially illegal territory, depending on local laws.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in being protective of their pet. The neighbor's dog was a threat, and their lack of response added to the frustration. The author's actions were in response to immediate danger to their pet, which is a strong mitigating factor. But the method of defense (kicking) might be seen as too harsh, even if it was to save their dog.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can only use proportionate force to control an animal. Kicking might be considered disproportionate, especially if it caused harm to the neighbor's dog. The author might be liable for harming another person's property (the dog) if it wasn't necessary. However, if the dog was actively attacking, the defense might be justified.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is also key here. If the owner didn't take steps to prevent the dog from escaping and attacking, they could be at fault. The author might be within their rights to take measures to protect their pet, especially if the owner isn't doing their part.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author used force to protect their dog, which is understandable, but the method might be questionable. The neighbor is clearly negligent. The author's threat of violence is a problem. However, the situation is more complicated because the neighbor's actions (or inactions) contributed to the problem. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for using physical force on the dog, but the neighbor is more at fault for not controlling their dog. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they did kick the dog and made threats, there might be legal issues, but emotionally, they were protecting their pet. The answer might depend on local laws, but generally, the author's actions could be seen as justified in defense of their property, but the method might be excessive. However, the neighbor's negligence is a major point. The author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for debate.\n"
