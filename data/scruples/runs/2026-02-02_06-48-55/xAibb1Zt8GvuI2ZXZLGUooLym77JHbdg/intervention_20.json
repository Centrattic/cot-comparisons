They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog. The author ended up kicking the dog when it was attacking their pet, and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The neighbor's dog is a large mix that jumped the wall twice and attacked the small dog. The author tried to intervene both times, and on the second occasion, had to physically stop the dog from choking their pet. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the key points here are the neighbor's responsibility for their dog. If the dog is uncontrolled and poses a danger, the owner is typically responsible. The author's actions were in defense of their own pet. Kicking the dog to stop an attack could be a split-second reaction. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as aggressive, even if justified by the situation.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, defending one's property (in this case, a pet) might be reasonable, but using force that could be considered excessive might not be. However, the author's intention was to protect their dog from a life-threatening attack. The neighbor's apathy is a problem because they didn't take measures to control the dog. The author's threat could be seen as a justified warning to ensure the neighbor takes responsibility, but the wording (\"kill it\") might be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's actions in stopping the attack could be seen as necessary, but the subsequent threats might be overstepping. However, given the immediate danger, the author's response can be understood as a way to protect their pet. The neighbor's lack of action is also a contributing factor. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but their response could have been more measured. The answer might hinge on cultural or legal standards, but in this context, the author's primary intent was protection, which often justifies strong actions.\n"
