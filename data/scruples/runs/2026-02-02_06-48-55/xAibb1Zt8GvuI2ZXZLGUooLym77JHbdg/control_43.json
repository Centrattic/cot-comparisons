They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author has a small dog and a neighbor with a bigger pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The big dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked the small dog. The first time, the author pulled it off. The second time, the dog was on the small one's neck, so the author kicked it. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. Legally, if someone's dog attacks another, the owner is usually liable. The neighbor's dog is clearly a threat here. The author acted to protect their own dog. Kicking the dog to make it let go might be seen as a reasonable defense, especially considering the immediate danger. The neighbor's lack of action is concerning and could be their fault for not controlling the dog properly.\n\nBut wait, using physical force against someone's dog could have legal implications. If the author injured the neighbor's dog without cause, they might be liable. But in this case, the neighbor's dog was attacking their dog, so it's self-defense. Also, the author threatened to kill the dog if it happened again. Threatening someone's pet isn't great, but given the circumstances, it might be understandable. However, the author should have contacted animal control first instead of making threats. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is at fault for not securing their dog and not taking it to a vet or training. The author's actions were in defense of their own pet. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were protecting their dog. The neighbor is the one at fault for not controlling the dog. The author might have overreacted with the threats, but the immediate action was necessary. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
