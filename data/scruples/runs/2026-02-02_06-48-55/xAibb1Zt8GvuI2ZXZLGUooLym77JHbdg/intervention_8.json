They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog attack and the response taken. \n\nFirst, the author's dog was attacked by the neighbor's dog twice. The first time, the neighbor dog jumped the wall and chased the author's dog. The author pulled it off, and the neighbor retrieved the dog. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time with its mouth around the author's dog's neck. The author kicked the dog twice to get it to let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog again if it happened.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Self-defense for pets: if an animal is attacking your pet, many jurisdictions allow reasonable force to protect them. Kicking the dog to stop the attack could be seen as necessary. However, the author also threatened to kill the dog and harm the neighbor if they trespassed again. Threats of violence, even if in anger, might be problematic. But the immediate action to stop the attack is more defensible.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility: they didn't secure their dog properly. If the dog is a known aggressive breed and they let it off-leash where it can jump the wall, they might be at fault. The neighbor's apology without action could indicate negligence. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in self-defense for their dog, but the threats after could be seen as overreacting. However, the immediate response (kicking the dog) was to prevent harm. The key here is the reasonableness of the force used. If the force was necessary and proportional, the author might not be in the wrong. The threats might not be the main issue here, as they were a warning after the fact, but in some places, even verbal threats can have consequences. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the neighbor's failure to control their dog and the immediate danger to their pet, the author's actions to stop the attack seem justified. The threats could be a red flag, but maybe in the heat of the moment. The answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, the kicking part\u2014if it was excessive, maybe. But since the dog was attacking, a reasonable response would be okay. So I think B.\n"
