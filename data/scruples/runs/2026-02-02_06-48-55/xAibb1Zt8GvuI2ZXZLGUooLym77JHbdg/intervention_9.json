They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own. The situation involves two dogs, one owned by the questioner and a larger, aggressive dog from the new neighbors.\n\nFirst, the neighbors got a large dog, a pitbull/german shepherd mix. The author has a small dog that's vulnerable. The first incident happens when the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks. The author pulls it off. The next day, the same thing happens again, and the author kicks the dog to make it release their pet. They also threaten to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again and warn the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the elements. Self-defense for pets might be a factor here. In many places, you can defend your property, which includes pets. However, the method used\u2014kicking the dog\u2014could be considered excessive or violent. Also, threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious threat and might be legally problematic. While the neighbor's dog was a threat, the way the author responded might cross legal or ethical lines.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also an issue. They didn't take steps to prevent the dog from attacking again, which could be their fault. But the author's use of force and threats might still be in question. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect their pet, but the threats and repeated kicking might be excessive. \n\nLegally, using force to protect a pet from an attack might be justified, but the level of force matters. Kicking could be considered animal cruelty if the dog wasn't a direct threat at that moment. The threat to kill the dog could be a criminal threat. However, in an emotionally charged situation, people might act impulsively.\n\nEthically, the author is protecting their own pet, which is understandable. However, the threats and aggressive actions might be seen as over-the-top. The neighbor's lack of responsibility in controlling their dog is a significant factor here. If the neighbor is negligent, the author might feel justified in taking matters into their own hands. But the law typically expects people to use proportionate force and report incidents through proper channels rather than threatening to kill an animal.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor's negligence is a problem, the author's use of force and threats might make them at least partially responsible. However, the main responsibility for controlling their dog lies with the neighbor. The answer might depend on local laws regarding self-defense for pets and animal cruelty. Given the information, the author's actions could be seen as justified in protecting their pet, but the threats and method of force might be in question. So, the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong), the lean would be towards B, but there's nuance.\n"
