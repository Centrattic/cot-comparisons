They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor's dog keeps jumping over the wall to attack their smaller dog. The first time, the author tries to pull the dog off, then the next day, the dog attacks again and the author kicks it. The neighbor just apologizes but doesn't take action. The author then threatens the neighbor about the dog. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The neighbor's dog is a large breed (pitbull/german shepherd mix) that's attacking a small dog. The first time, the dog jumps the wall and the author tries to stop it. The second time, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks it. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor isn't doing much to stop it.\n\nLegally, in many places, there are laws about animal attacks. If a dog attacks another dog on your property, you might have the right to protect your own pet. However, using force like kicking the dog could be a problem. Kicking might be considered animal cruelty unless it's in immediate self-defense or defense of your pet. But some places have specific laws about how you can act to protect your animals.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect their dog, which is understandable. But the method they used (kicking) could be seen as excessive. Also, threatening to kill the dog might be taken seriously. However, the neighbor's inaction could be a contributing factor. The neighbor isn't doing anything to secure their dog, which might be their responsibility.\n\nThe author's response to protect their pet is justified, but the method and the threats might be where they cross the line. Kicking the dog could be seen as unnecessary force if there was a way to separate them without violence. Also, threatening the neighbor's dog could lead to legal issues, depending on local laws.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is at fault for not containing their dog, which is a responsibility of the pet owner. The dog's repeated aggression is a problem they need to address. The author's frustration is valid, but the response might be over the top.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't go to the extent of killing another person's animal unless it's in immediate danger. The author's threat might be a problem if it's not a legal option. Also, physical harm to the dog could be considered criminal if the dog is on the neighbor's property.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for using physical force against the dog and making threats. However, the neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but generally, the author's actions might be considered overstepping what's acceptable. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the kicking and threats, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) for protecting their pet. It's a tough call, but I think the author's actions could legally and ethically be problematic.\n"
