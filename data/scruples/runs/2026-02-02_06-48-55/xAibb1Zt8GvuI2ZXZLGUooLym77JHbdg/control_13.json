They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog attack and the response taken.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their neighbor's large dog twice jumped into their yard and attacked their smaller dog. The first time, they pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so they kicked the neighbor's dog. They also threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and told the neighbor to keep the dog under control or face consequences.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The neighbor's dog was uncontrolled and aggressive. The author was trying to protect their own dog, which is their responsibility. Kicking the dog in self-defense to prevent injury to their pet might be justifiable. However, the threat to kill the dog or involve animal control adds complexity. Threatening violence could be seen as overstepping, even if the initial action was defensive.\n\nBut in many places, there are laws about controlling pets. If the neighbor's dog is a known threat, the author might have a right to protect their property. However, the method of defense (kicking the dog) could be an issue. Depending on local laws, using force against an animal might not be allowed unless it's necessary to prevent harm. Also, threatening to kill someone else's dog is a serious threat and might be illegal. So, while protecting their own dog is understandable, the author's response might have crossed a line with the threats.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a problem. They didn't take steps to prevent the dog from escaping, which is their responsibility. But the author's reaction includes threats that could be legally problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong for the threats, even if the initial action was defensive. But maybe not entirely, because protecting their dog is a valid concern. It's a gray area. The key points are the threats and the force used. Kicking the dog might be acceptable in the moment to save their pet, but threatening to kill it or involve animal control could be problematic. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats, but B (not in the wrong) for protecting their dog. Hmm. It's tricky. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering both sides, the author's actions were in defense of their pet, but the threats might be the issue. So, maybe the answer is A because of the threats, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the neighbor is more at fault for not controlling their dog. The author's actions could be seen as self-defense. However, the line between self-defense and aggression is thin here. The legal aspect depends on local laws, but generally, threatening violence against someone else's property (the dog) might be considered threatening. So, the author could be in the wrong for the threats and the force used. So, answer A.\n"
