They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and the author pulls it off. The next day, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks the dog to get it off. Then the author threatens the neighbor if it happens again. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding self-defense with animals. In many places, you can defend your property, which includes your pets. If an animal is threatening your pet, you might be allowed to take reasonable actions to protect them. Kicking the dog could be seen as a defensive measure, but maybe the threat part is iffy.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's response was just an apology without taking action. The author's threats of calling animal control or killing the dog might be extreme, but given the situation, they might feel justified. However, making threats to kill someone else's pet is a serious matter. Even if the dog is a danger, the appropriate action is usually to call authorities rather than take matters into your own hands.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might be at fault for not securing their dog properly and not taking responsibility. But the author's threat to kill the dog could be seen as overreacting, regardless of the provocation. So there's a balance here between protecting one's own pets and the appropriate response to a threat.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, kicking the dog in the heat of the moment might be understandable as a reaction to protect their pet. But the follow-up threats to kill or harm the dog might cross a line. Legally, you can't just threaten to kill someone else's animal, even if it's a danger. The appropriate step would be to report the dog to the authorities, not make threats.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for the threats, even if their initial reaction was justified. The line between self-defense and vigilantism can be thin here. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog, but the question is specifically about the author's actions. The author's response escalated beyond what's typically acceptable, so they might be in the wrong for the threats, but maybe not for the physical action during the attack.\n"
