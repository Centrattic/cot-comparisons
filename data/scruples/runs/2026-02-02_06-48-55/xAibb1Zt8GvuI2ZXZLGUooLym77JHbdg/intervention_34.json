They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs, one of which is a larger dog that jumped the wall and attacked the smaller one. The writer kicked the larger dog when it was attacking their own dog, and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's dog is a bigger mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the smaller dog. The first time, the writer pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog was attacking again, the writer kicked it. The neighbor didn't take any action beyond apologizing.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense for the pet. In many jurisdictions, you can defend your property (which includes your pet) from an attack. However, the method of defense is important. Kicking the dog might be seen as excessive if it caused harm, but if it was necessary to stop the attack, it could be justified. The neighbor not taking action to control their dog is a problem too. They should be responsible for their pet's actions, especially if it's a known aggressive dog.\n\nThe writer's threats to call animal control or \"kill\" the dog are problematic. While they have a right to be upset, threatening to kill another person's property without just cause could be illegal or at least very aggressive. The neighbor also didn't do anything to prevent the attacks, which is their responsibility.\n\nSo, the writer might have acted in self-defense for their dog's safety, but the threats could be seen as over the line. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. The answer might be a mix, but the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since they used force to protect their dog, maybe not entirely in the wrong, but their threats might make them partially at fault. However, the neighbor's negligence is a big part of the issue.\n"
