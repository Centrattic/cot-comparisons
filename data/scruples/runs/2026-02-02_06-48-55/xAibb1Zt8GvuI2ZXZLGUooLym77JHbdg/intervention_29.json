They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The person describes a situation where their neighbor's large dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked their small dog. The first time, they pulled the dog off, and the next day, when the dog attacked again, they kicked it hard to make it let go. The neighbor only apologized without taking action, leading the person to threaten the neighbor if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person has a small dog that's at risk from a larger, aggressive dog. The neighbor's dog has already attacked twice, and the neighbor didn't take steps to prevent it. The person felt threatened and acted to protect their own dog. \n\nLegally, in many places, you can act to protect your property, which includes your pets. However, the method of protection matters. Kicking an animal might be considered excessive or animal cruelty, depending on the jurisdiction. But since the dog was attacking their own pet, the person might be seen as defending their dog. \n\nEthically, the person is in a stressful situation. They had no time to think, and their immediate reaction was to protect their pet. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem because they didn't control their dog, which could be their responsibility. \n\nThe person threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. Threats of violence might escalate the situation, but it's understandable given the fear for their pet's safety. The key point is that the neighbor's dog is repeatedly trespassing and attacking, which is their fault first. \n\nHowever, the person's response was to kick the dog. While understandable in the moment, using physical force against another person's pet might be seen as wrong, even if it was to protect their own. The appropriate action might have been to call animal control or the neighbor to stop it immediately. \n\nIn some places, you can use reasonable force to protect your animals. Kicking the dog could be considered reasonable if it was to stop an immediate threat. But if the force was excessive, that could be an issue. The person might have overreacted in their anger, but the context is a life-threatening attack on their pet. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is definitely a problem. They are responsible for their dog's actions and should have taken control measures. The person's frustration is justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The person acted in defense of their pet, which is a valid reason, but the method might be questionable. However, given the immediate threat, it's a protective action. The neighbor's failure to control the dog is a major factor. The person's threats might be excessive, but their actions in the moment were to save their dog. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they acted to protect their pet, and the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The person's actions were in self-defense for their animal.\n"
