They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, the situation is about two neighbors. The writer has a small dog, and the new neighbors got a large, possibly aggressive dog. The big dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the small dog. The first time, the writer pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog attacked again and had the writer's dog by the neck, the writer kicked the dog to make it let go. The neighbor just apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. Now the writer is wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animals and self-defense. In many places, if an animal is attacking your pet, you have the right to protect your own animals. However, the method used might matter. Kicking the dog could be seen as excessive if it caused harm beyond what's necessary to stop the attack. But if the dog was actively attacking and the writer had no other option, it might be justified.\n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is known to be aggressive and they're not keeping it under control, they might be at fault. However, the writer threatened to \"kill\" or call animal control, which could be seen as a harsh response. But considering the dog attacked twice, maybe the writer is justified in being upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the dog trespassing twice, attacking without provocation, the writer acting in defense of their pet, and the neighbor's lack of action. The writer's actions were in the moment to protect their dog. Kicking the dog to make it release the small dog might be a reasonable defensive action. Threatening to call animal control or take drastic measures if the dog attacks again is a way to enforce responsibility on the neighbor. \n\nBut wait, does the threat of killing the dog cross a line? That could be problematic. However, given the circumstances of the dog attacking twice and the neighbor not taking action, maybe it's a strong but understandable threat. The writer might be justified in feeling that their pet is in danger and that the neighbor isn't doing enough. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer was trying to protect their pet from an aggressive dog. Their actions were reactive but in defense. The neighbor's dog is the one that attacked, so the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B (no).\n"
