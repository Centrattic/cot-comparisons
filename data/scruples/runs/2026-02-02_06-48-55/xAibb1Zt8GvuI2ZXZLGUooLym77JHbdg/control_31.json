They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's smaller dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog had the author's dog by the neck, the author kicked it. The neighbor didn't take any action to prevent this from happening again and just apologized afterwards.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's primary concern is protecting their own pet. The dog in question is a large breed that could indeed pose a serious threat to a small dog. The neighbor didn't seem to take the situation seriously, only apologizing without taking steps to prevent future incidents.\n\nIn terms of self-defense for pets, there's a principle that people have the right to protect their property and pets from immediate harm. However, the method used here\u2014kicking the dog\u2014might cross a line. While it's understandable to act in the moment to save a pet, using physical force could be seen as excessive or dangerous. Also, the author threatened the neighbor with violence, which is a serious matter. Threats can lead to legal consequences, and even if the intent is to protect the pet, making threats of harm or death might be legally problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's inaction is also a significant factor. If they knew their dog was a danger and didn't take responsibility, that's their fault. The author might feel justified in standing up for themselves, but the way they handled it could be an issue. The threat to \"kill\" the dog if necessary might be overstepping, as that's a felony in many places. Also, trespassing laws might apply if the neighbor's dog is on the author's property again, but the author's threats to \"do something about that\" could involve illegal actions.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to protect their pet, but the specific actions (kicking the dog and making threats) could be problematic. However, the neighbor's lack of responsibility is a big part of the problem. The question is whether the author's actions are legally and morally acceptable. In many jurisdictions, you can take reasonable steps to protect your property or pets from immediate harm, which might include using some force. But threatening to kill the dog or harm the neighbor could be seen as excessive.\n\nThe answer likely depends on local laws, but in general, the author might not be the asshole for defending their pet, but the way they handled it could be in the wrong. However, since the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the author might be justified in taking some protective action. The threats to call animal control are okay, but threatening to kill the dog is a problem. Kicking a dog could also be considered animal cruelty if the dog wasn't an immediate threat, but in this case, it was protecting their own pet. \n\nOverall, the author's actions are in response to negligence from the neighbor. The threats might be the main issue here. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, in the context of the question, where the user is asking if the author is the asshole, the answer leans towards B.\n"
