They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for kicking a dog that attacked their own dog. The situation is that their neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked their smaller dog. The first time, they grabbed it and pulled it off. The second time, the dog got on their dog's neck, so they kicked it to make it let go. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again.\n\nHmm, so first, the neighbor's dog is clearly a problem. The person tried to protect their own dog, which makes sense. The neighbor didn't seem to take it seriously, just said sorry each time. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions.\n\nLegally, in many places, if your dog is in danger, you can take reasonable steps to protect it. Kicking the dog might be considered reasonable in self-defense for the dog. But maybe it's a bit of a gray area. However, threatening to kill the dog could be an issue. Animal control is usually the right step, but threatening to kill might be over the line. Also, the neighbor might have legal recourse if the injury to their dog is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. They should have kept it on a leash or secured properly. The author's actions were in response to a threat. Emotional response is understandable, especially after two incidents.\n\nBut the author's threat to kill the dog could be problematic. It might be seen as excessive or not giving the neighbor a chance to fix the issue. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like contacting the authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They tried to protect their dog, which is good. The kicking might be justified. The threats are more questionable. But overall, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were defending their pet. However, the threats could be seen as overstepping. But in the heat of the moment... It's a tough call. I think the neighbor is more at fault for not controlling their dog. The author's actions were reactive. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
