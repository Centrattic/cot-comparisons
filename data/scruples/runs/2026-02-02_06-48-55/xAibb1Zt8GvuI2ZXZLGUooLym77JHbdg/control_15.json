They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their neighbor has a big dog that jumped over the wall twice and attacked their small dog. The first time, the author managed to pull the neighbor's dog off, but the next day it happened again, and this time the author kicked the dog to make it let go. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't do anything else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and typical expectations in such a scenario. In many places, you have a duty to prevent harm to your property (including pets) and can take reasonable measures to protect them. However, using force that causes injury to another person's animal might be a gray area. If the dog is a known danger, there are probably legal steps like reporting to animal control, but threatening to kill the dog might be crossing a line. \n\nThe author's actions were in response to immediate threats to their own dog. Kicking the dog to make it release their pet could be seen as self-defense for their dog. However, threatening to kill the dog might be considered excessive or threatening violence, which could be illegal or at least socially frowned upon. Also, the neighbor's apathy might contribute to the problem, as they didn't take steps to control their dog after the first incident.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author's actions were reasonable. Using physical force in the moment to protect their dog might be justifiable. But the threats afterward could be problematic. Depending on local laws, threatening another person's animal could be an issue. However, if the dog is repeatedly a threat, the author might have a valid grievance. It's possible that the neighbor is also at fault for not securing their dog properly. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions during the incident might be seen as self-defense, but the threats might be where they could be in the wrong. However, if the dog was a known aggressive animal and the neighbor didn't take responsibility, the author's frustration is understandable. But in terms of legal or ethical standpoint, threatening to kill someone's pet is likely not acceptable, even if provoked. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the threats, but not for the act of kicking the dog in the moment to protect their own.\n"
