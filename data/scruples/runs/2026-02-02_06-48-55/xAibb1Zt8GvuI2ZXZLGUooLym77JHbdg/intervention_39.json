They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about their neighbor's dog jumping into their yard and attacking their smaller dog. The writer kicked the dog to get it off, then threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large mix, which could be dangerous. The writer has a small dog, and the neighbor's dog jumped over the wall twice, attacking. The first time, the writer pulled the dog off, and the second time, the dog had the writer's dog by the neck, leading the writer to kick it. Then they threatened the neighbor if it happened again.\n\nNow, the writer's actions: kicking the dog. That's a physical act. But was it necessary? They were trying to protect their dog. Self-defense for their pet? Maybe. But using violence on the dog might be a problem. Also, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be an issue. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action, like keeping the dog on a leash. \n\nLegally, I'm not sure. In some places, you can protect your animals from threats. But using force might depend on the situation. If the dog was uncontrolled, maybe the writer had a right to act. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog could be problematic, especially if the neighbor didn't take responsibility. But the neighbor's inaction is also a problem. They got a dog that's not well-behaved and didn't take steps to prevent it from escaping.\n\nEmotionally, the writer is upset because their dog was in danger. They felt justified in protecting their pet. However, the threat of killing the dog might be over the line. Maybe they should have called animal control or the police instead of making threats. The neighbor might have a case for not controlling their dog, but the writer's response could be seen as aggressive. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the neighbor's negligence in controlling the dog and the writer's defensive actions. The writer's kick was to protect their dog in an emergency, which could be understandable. But the threats after the fact might be excessive. The neighbor might be at fault for not securing their dog, but the writer's response could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of social norms, threatening to kill someone else's animal is usually not acceptable. Even if justified, it's better to involve authorities rather than make threats. So maybe the writer is in the wrong in terms of their response, even if their initial actions were defensive. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling the dog, but the question is about the writer specifically. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the writer is in the wrong because of the threats and physical harm to the dog, despite the neighbor's negligence. But maybe not entirely, since protecting their own pet is a valid concern. It's a bit of a gray area. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but maybe the neighbor is also at fault. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The threats and physical harm might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
