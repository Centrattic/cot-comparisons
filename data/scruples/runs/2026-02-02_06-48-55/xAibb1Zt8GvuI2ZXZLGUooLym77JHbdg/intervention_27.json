They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors with dogs. The author's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's dog is a larger pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice, attacking the author's dog each time. The author kicks the dog to save their own, and then threatens to call animal control or even kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor only apologizes without taking action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal attacks. In many places, if an animal is threatening another or causing harm, the owner can be held responsible. The neighbor didn't take steps to secure their dog, which is a problem. The author's immediate reaction to protect their own dog is understandable. However, the use of physical force (kicking) and the threats made afterward are questionable. \n\nKicking an animal could be considered animal cruelty, even if it's to protect another animal. But in self-defense for the pet, it might be justified. However, intentionally injuring another's animal could lead to legal consequences. The threats of killing the dog or calling animal control are also serious. While the neighbor is negligent, the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is definitely an issue. They didn't take responsibility, which is wrong. But the author's threat to kill the dog without legal recourse is a problem. The correct action would be to call animal control or talk to the neighbor about securing their pet. The author's actions might be seen as aggressive, even if their intent was protective. \n\nSo, the author is partially at fault because they resorted to violence and threats instead of more legal and non-violent solutions. However, the neighbor is clearly negligent. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the physical violence and threats, even if the situation is stressful.\n"
