They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The context is about a dog attack and the author's response.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off. The second time, when the dog had the small dog by the neck, the author kicked the neighbor's dog. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatened the neighbor with calling animal control or killing the dog next time and mentioned trespassing.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nLegal perspective: In many places, you can act to defend your property or pets if there's an immediate threat. Kicking the dog to stop the attack might be considered reasonable force. However, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic because that might be considered illegal. Also, trespassing laws vary, but if the dog is on the author's property without permission, the neighbor could have a case for trespassing.\n\nMoral/ethical angle: The neighbor's dog is causing harm, and the owner isn't taking responsibility. The author's actions to protect their pet might be seen as justified. But the threats of killing the dog might be overstepping unless there's a legal avenue to do so (like through animal control).\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Threatening violence (even if not carried out) can be seen as aggressive. The kick might have been excessive if the dog was just attacking, but if it had the small dog by the neck, it's a dire situation. Also, the author's response could escalate the conflict.\n\nPossible arguments for the author: The owner's negligence in controlling their dog is a big factor. The author's actions were in defense of their pet, which is their right. The threats might be a strong reaction but understandable given the fear for their pet's life.\n\nI need to consider if \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) standards usually lean towards de-escalation and legal methods. The author used force, which might be okay, but the threats of killing the dog could be crossing a line. However, the neighbor's apathy in not controlling their dog is also a problem.\n\nSo, the author's actions to protect their dog might be justified, but the threats may not be. The answer might depend on local laws, but since the user is asking for a general opinion, maybe the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for the threats (A). But since the dog was attacking, using force to stop it is self-defense. The threats might be the issue here. However, in many cases, people are allowed to defend their pets. Still, the threat of killing someone else's pet is a big step. \n\nHmm. In some jurisdictions, you can't just kill someone else's animal, even if they attack. You should involve authorities. So threatening to kill might be the part where the author is wrong. The initial kick might be okay, but the threats could be the problem. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for the threats, but maybe not for stopping the attack. However, the question is about the overall situation. Since the author is asking if they are in the wrong, considering both the action and the threats, the answer might be A.\n"
