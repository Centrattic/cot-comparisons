They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hurting their neighbor's dog that attacked their own. \n\nFirst, context is important. The writer has a small dog and a new neighbor with a large, aggressive-looking dog. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the writer's dog. The first time, the writer pulled the dog off. The second time, the neighbor's dog was attacking their dog, so the writer kicked the dog to make it let go. The neighbor just said sorry without taking any preventive measures.\n\nNow, considering self-defense and protecting one's property. In many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your pets. The writer acted in the moment to stop an attack. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as harsh, but given the threat to their own dog, it's understandable. The neighbor's apathy is a problem because they didn't secure their dog properly, which could lead to legal issues for them.\n\nThe key points: The writer's actions were in response to an immediate threat. The neighbor failed to control their dog. The writer's threats were likely a reaction to the neighbor's inaction. While the kicking might be seen as a justified defense, the threats could be problematic. However, given the context, the writer's actions are more about protecting their pet. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. Some might argue that the writer should have called the authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands. But since the neighbor didn't act, the writer felt compelled to. The answer is probably B, but it's a close call. Need to check if threatening to kill the animal is acceptable. In many places, you can't kill someone else's property without legal process. So maybe the threats are where the writer is in the wrong. Hmm. So the kicking might be justified, but the threats are not. So maybe A? But the question is about the author being in the wrong overall. The main issue is the physical action (kicking) and the threats. If the threats are considered over the line, but the initial action was defense, it's a mix. However, since the dog was attacking their pet, using force to stop it is understandable. The neighbor's fault is for not controlling the dog. So overall, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
