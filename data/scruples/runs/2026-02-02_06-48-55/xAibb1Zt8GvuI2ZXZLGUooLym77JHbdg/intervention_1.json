They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their actions towards their neighbor's dog. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author has a small dog, a Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix. Their new neighbors got a large, beefy pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The dog jumped over the wall twice, attacking the author's dog both times. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the neighbor's dog had the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked the dog twice to get it off. They then threatened the neighbor about calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they overreacted. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone's pet attacks another animal on your property, you might have the right to defend your animal. However, using physical force like kicking the dog could be a problem. Depending on the jurisdiction, causing harm to someone else's property (the dog) could lead to liability. Even if the dog was aggressive, the author might be held responsible for any injury they caused.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The neighbor's dog did attack the author's pet, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's response was only to say sorry without taking measures to prevent future incidents. The author felt their small dog was at risk, which is understandable. But using force to injure the other dog might be seen as excessive, even in defense. The threats of killing the dog could also be problematic, as that's a serious action.\n\nThe neighbors' apathy is a key point. They didn't take steps to secure their dog after the first attack, which is their responsibility. However, the author's reaction involved physical aggression towards the dog, which might escalate the situation. Threats of harm to the dog or neighbor could also lead to legal issues for the author.\n\nI should also consider whether the author could have taken alternative actions. Maybe calling animal control immediately after the first incident, or discussing with the neighbor to have the dog on a leash. Kicking the dog might be seen as self-defense in protecting their own pet, but the method and the subsequent threats might be considered over the top.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or pets. But kicking the dog twice, especially hard, might not be considered reasonable. The author's threats to kill the dog could also be problematic, as that's typically up to authorities, not individuals.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions might be seen as justified in protecting their pet, but the method and threats could be problematic. However, if the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the author's response might be excusable. But legally, using force without legal justification could put the author in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because using physical force and making threats might not be legally or ethically acceptable, even if the neighbor is negligent. The author should have taken other measures first, like contacting authorities or the neighbor directly to resolve the issue without violence.\n"
