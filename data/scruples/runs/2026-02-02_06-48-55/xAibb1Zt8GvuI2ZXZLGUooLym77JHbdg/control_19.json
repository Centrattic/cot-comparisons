They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The person describes how their neighbor's dog jumped over the wall twice, attacking their own dog each time. The first time, they pulled the dog off, and the second time, they kicked it to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The person is now questioning if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and ethical aspects. In many places, laws protect animals from cruelty, so intentionally harming another person's pet could be problematic. Even if it's in self-defense for their own dog, the method used (kicking) might be seen as excessive. However, the context is that the neighbor's dog was a threat to their small dog, which could justify defensive actions to protect their pet.\n\nNext, the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is a known aggressive breed or has a history of such behavior, the owner is usually expected to control it, like using a leash or secure fencing. The neighbor's apathy in the situation\u2014just apologizing without taking measures to prevent future attacks\u2014could be seen as negligence. That might mitigate the blame on the person defending their dog.\n\nBut the person threatened to kill the dog or call animal control. Threats can be a red flag, even if justified by the circumstances. However, given the immediate danger to their own pet, their reaction might be more understandable. The key here is whether the force used was reasonable. Kicking a dog in self-defense to protect another animal could be debated. In some jurisdictions, using reasonable force to prevent harm to your property (including pets) is allowed, but it's a gray area.\n\nEthically, people might sympathize with the person trying to protect their pet, especially if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility. But legally, there could be issues. The person might be advised to document incidents and perhaps involve authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands. The neighbor might need to be held accountable for their dog's behavior, which is their legal responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the person might not be entirely in the wrong, especially since they were defending their own dog. However, the act of threatening to kill the dog or calling animal control could be seen as crossing a line, depending on local laws. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely a problem. The answer hinges on whether the force was justified. Since the dog was attacking their pet and they acted in the moment to stop it, it's a complex situation. The person might be in the right, but maybe the threats were excessive. However, given that they were scared and protecting their animal, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
