They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor's dog keeps jumping over the wall and attacking their smaller dog. The author ends up kicking the dog when it's attacking their pet, and then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the immediate actions. The dog is attacking their own dog. In that moment, self-defense for your pet might be justified. Kicking the dog to save their own pet could be seen as a necessary action to stop an attack. However, the use of force should be proportionate. If the dog was actively attacking, a kick might be considered reasonable to protect the pet, but maybe there's a debate about how aggressive the response was.\n\nThen there's the threat part. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. Threats of violence, even if directed at another's property (the dog), can be problematic. It's understandable to be angry and scared, but making such threats might be crossing a line. Similarly, threatening the neighbor for trespassing by implying physical harm could be an issue.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. They didn't take steps to prevent the dog from attacking again. But the author's response was to escalate to threats and physical action. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like involving authorities or legal measures instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can take reasonable steps to protect your property (which includes your dog) from immediate harm. However, threatening to kill someone else's pet is a strong action and may not be legally protected. The author's actions might be defensible in the moment, but the threats afterward could lead to legal consequences.\n\nEmotionally, the author was clearly upset and scared for their dog. It's easy to overreact in such situations. But the key is whether their actions were proportionate and necessary. Kicking the dog to stop an attack is one thing, but the follow-up threats might be seen as excessive.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility is to control their dog. If they didn't take action after the first incident, they might share some responsibility. However, the author's response of threatening the neighbor and their dog might not be the right approach. They should perhaps have contacted the authorities or sought legal recourse instead of making threats.\n\nIn summary, while the immediate action to protect their dog might be understandable and possibly justified, the threats made afterward are likely problematic and could place the author in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the threats, even if the initial actions were in self-defense.\n"
