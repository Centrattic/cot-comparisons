They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog, and they ended up kicking the dog. The main question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the user's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's dog is a large breed. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the user's dog both times. The first time, the user had to pull the dog off. The second time, the neighbor's dog had the user's dog by the neck, and the user kicked it to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents, like keeping the dog on a leash.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, you have a duty to prevent harm to your property, which includes animals. If an animal is a known threat, the owner is responsible. The user acted to protect their pet, which is a reasonable response. However, using force on another person's animal can be legally tricky. Kicking the dog might be considered animal cruelty, depending on local laws. But since it was in defense of their own pet, some jurisdictions might view it as justified.\n\nEmotionally, the user was clearly scared, especially after two incidents. The neighbor's apathy is concerning because they didn't take steps to control their aggressive dog. The user's threat to call animal control or kill the dog next time is a strong statement, but it's a response to the ongoing danger. The neighbor's failure to secure their dog properly (letting it jump the wall twice) could be their fault.\n\nHowever, the user's actions of threatening to kill the dog might be seen as excessive, even if the neighbor is negligent. The kick might be justified in the moment, but threats of killing could escalate the situation unnaturally. Still, considering the immediate danger to a small dog, many would argue the user had no choice but to act to protect their pet.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the user might have a case for self-defense of their animal, but the threats could be problematic. The neighbor's negligence is significant. Overall, the user's actions seem more about protecting their pet than being in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that threats might not be the best approach.\n"
