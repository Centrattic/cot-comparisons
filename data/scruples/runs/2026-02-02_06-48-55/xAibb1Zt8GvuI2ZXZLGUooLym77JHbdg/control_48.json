They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs, one from each neighbor, and some altercations.\n\nFirst, the user's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's dog is a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the user's dog. The first time, the user tried to pull it off. The second time, the user kicked the dog when it had their dog's neck. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and also mentioned doing something about the neighbor if the dog trespassed again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The user's actions: defending their own dog from an immediate threat. When the neighbor's dog was attacking their small dog, kicking it to get it off could be seen as self-defense for their pet. However, using force, especially kicking, might be considered excessive. Also, the threats afterward\u2014threatening to kill the dog or take action against the neighbor\u2014might cross a line, even if motivated by fear.\n\nBut the neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. The dog is large and aggressive, and it's their responsibility to keep it from attacking others. The neighbor's apathy and only saying sorry without taking measures to prevent future incidents is problematic. \n\nSo, the user's actions were in response to an immediate threat to their pet. Kicking the dog might be justified in that moment, but the subsequent threats could be seen as over the top. However, considering the neighbor's lack of action, maybe the user was justifiably angry. \n\nIn terms of the law, using reasonable force to protect one's property (like a pet) is usually allowed. Kicking might be within that if it was necessary to stop the attack. But the threats to kill the dog or harm the neighbor might be illegal or at least unethical. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on the balance between their self-defense actions and the threats. If the force was reasonable, then maybe not. But the threats could make them the asshole. However, the neighbor's negligence is also a factor. \n\nI think the community would weigh in on whether the user's actions were proportionate. The kicking during an attack might be okay, but the threats might be crossing a line. So maybe the user is partially at fault for the threats, but not entirely. Alternatively, if the neighbor is negligent, the user's response might be understandable. \n\nBut according to the rules, I need to pick A or B. Given that the user took action to protect their dog, which is their responsibility, and the neighbor didn't control their dog, the user's actions might be justified. However, the threats could be the issue. But in the heat of the moment, maybe it's understandable. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because they were defending their pet, even if the threats were harsh. But some might say they overreacted. Hmm. It's a tough call. But the initial defense of the dog is more justified. The threats might be a separate issue. So maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, if the threats are considered the wrong part, but the question is about the entire situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for threatening the dog and the neighbor. So overall, maybe they are not in the wrong because they were protecting their pet, but the threats could be a problem. But given the neighbor's inaction, maybe it's justified. So answer B.\n"
