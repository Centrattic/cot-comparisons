They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The context is that they have a small dog and the neighbor's larger dog (a pitbull/German Shepherd mix) jumped the wall twice and attacked their dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the second time they kicked it to make it let go. They also threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and ethical standards around this. In many places, there are laws about animal cruelty. If the author physically harmed the neighbor's dog, even in defense of their own pet, they could be in trouble. But if it was in self-defense for their dog's safety, maybe it's justified. However, the method of using physical force (kicking) might cross a line. Also, threatening to kill someone else's dog could lead to legal issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor didn't take responsibility. They said sorry but didn't take steps to prevent the dog from jumping the fence again. The neighbor's dog is a large breed that can be dangerous, and they might be negligent in not controlling it. The author's actions were to protect their own pet from a potential fatal attack, which is understandable.\n\nBut legally, the author might be in the wrong because they resorted to violence and threats. The proper course of action would be to contact the authorities, like animal control, rather than take matters into their own hands. Also, threatening to kill someone's dog is a serious threat and could be considered harassment or assault depending on the situation.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between protecting one's own pet and ensuring the neighbor's dog isn't harmed unnecessarily. The author might have felt justified in the moment but using force and threats might not be the best approach. The neighbor's lack of action is also a problem, but that doesn't excuse the author's response.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because of the physical harm and threats, even if their intentions were to protect their dog. They should have taken more legal steps instead of immediate retaliation.\n"
