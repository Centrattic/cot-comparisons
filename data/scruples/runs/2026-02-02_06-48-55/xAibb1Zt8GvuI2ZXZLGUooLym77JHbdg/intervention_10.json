They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is framed as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a small dog and a neighbor got a larger mixed breed dog. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked it to stop it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about their dog trespassing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nLegally, in many places, if an animal is attacking your pet, you have the right to defend your own animal. Kicking the dog might be seen as a reasonable act of self-defense for the pet. However, using violence on someone else's property might have consequences. The neighbor's inaction is a problem too; they might be negligent if their dog is aggressive. But the author's threats of killing the dog could be problematic. While the situation is distressing, threatening to kill an animal isn't typically a legal option unless the dog is a known danger or the owner is negligent.\n\nThe neighbor's apology without taking action might indicate they don't take the issue seriously, which is poor responsibility. However, the author's response of threatening violence might escalate the situation beyond what's acceptable. There might be better ways to handle it, like involving authorities or seeking legal action.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions in kicking the dog could be justified as protecting their pet, but the threats of killing the dog might be excessive. However, given the neighbor's failure to act, the author's frustration is understandable. The key is whether the response was proportionate. Kicking the dog might be reasonable in the moment, but the threats could be seen as over the top. Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, the owner might be liable for their dog's actions, so the author could have a case to pursue legal measures.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for defending their pet, but the threats might be an issue. However, since the neighbor didn't take responsibility, the author's reaction could be seen as a last resort. It's a bit of a gray area, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the immediate action to protect their pet was necessary, even if the threats were harsh. So answer B (No).\n"
