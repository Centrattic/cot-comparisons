They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors. The author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice, attacking the author's dog. The first time, the author pulls the dog off but is scared. The next day, the dog attacks again, this time grabbing the small dog's neck. The author kicks the neighbor's dog twice, leading to the dog letting go. The neighbor says sorry but doesn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again and warns the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nSo, the main points of contention here are: whether the author's actions were justified in protecting their dog, and if threatening the neighbor's dog or the neighbor is considered overstepping.\n\nFirst, the immediate issue is the safety of the author's dog. The neighbor's dog is large and has attacked twice. The first time, the author intervened physically. The second time, they kicked the dog. Kicking a dog, even in self-defense or to protect another animal, could be seen as excessive. However, given the urgency of the situation\u2014trying to save their small dog from a larger one\u2014it's a split-second decision. But physically harming another person's pet, even if it's attacking yours, might cross a legal line. In many places, you can't just harm someone else's property (which the dog is) unless it's to stop immediate damage. However, the line gets blurry when it's about protecting a pet.\n\nThen there's the threat made after the incident. The author told the neighbor that if the dog attacked again, they'd kill it or call animal control. Threats of violence, even against a pet, can be problematic. Legally, making threats might not be advisable. It could lead to legal trouble for the author if the neighbor decides to press charges or if it escalates further. Ethically, while understandable given the fear, threatening someone else's property isn't typically seen as acceptable, even if the motive is to protect one's own.\n\nThe neighbor's response was apologetic but not proactive. They didn't mention putting the dog on a leash or taking measures to prevent future incidents. Their inaction could be seen as negligence, especially since the dog has already attacked twice. However, the author's reaction to that inaction\u2014threatening to kill the dog\u2014might be seen as overreacting, even if the motivation was to protect their own pet.\n\nLegally, the author might have options like contacting animal control to report the dog as a potential threat, which is a more appropriate route than threatening the dog themselves. Physically harming the neighbor's dog could lead to liability issues if the neighbor sues for damages. The author might be considered at fault for using excessive force without legal justification.\n\nEthically, the situation is more nuanced. The author's primary concern is their dog's safety, which is understandable. However, the methods used to address the problem (kicking the dog and making threats) may not be the best approach. A better course of action might have been to immediately contact animal control after the first incident or involve the neighbor in finding a solution, like keeping the dog on a leash or in a secured area.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were protective, the actions taken (harming another's property and making threats) could place them in the wrong legally and ethically. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem, but the author's response may not be justified. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
