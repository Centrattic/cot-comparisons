They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation involves two dogs, the author's small mix breed and the neighbor's large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The author tried to stop the neighbor's dog from attacking theirs by kicking it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal interactions. In many places, there are laws about preventing harm to others' property, including pets. If the neighbor's dog is a danger to others, the owner might be responsible. The author acted to protect their dog, which might be considered a form of defense. However, using physical force like kicking could be a problem if it's excessive.\n\nThe neighbor's response was apologetic but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. Threats can be legally problematic, even if made in anger. However, the author's actions were in self-defense for their pet, which might be seen as justified in some contexts.\n\nIt's important to note that the neighbor's dog was uncontrolled, which is often the owner's responsibility. If the dog is known to be a danger, the owner might be at fault for not keeping it on a leash or in a secure area. The author's actions might be seen as a necessary defense of their property (their dog) and home.\n\nHowever, the method used (kicking) could be considered aggressive. Depending on local laws, using force to protect property versus protecting oneself might differ. Also, the threats made could lead to legal issues if they're deemed as threats of violence, even against an animal.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's inaction and allowing the dog to attack again might make them more at fault. But the author's response, especially the threats, might overstep. So the answer could hinge on whether the force used was reasonable and if the threats are acceptable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property. However, threatening to kill someone's dog is a serious threat and might not be legally protected. The author might have been within their rights to protect their dog but crossed a line with the threats.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the neighbor is negligent, the author acted to protect their dog, but the threats and the force used might be problematic. The answer might be that the author is partially at fault for the threats, but the neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, threatening harm to another's property (even an animal) could be an issue, but morally, it's more about self-defense. The answer depends on legal standards and community norms. Since the author's actions were to protect their pet and their home, but the threats might be excessive, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats. However, the initial question is a binary choice between A and B. Given that the author acted in defense of their pet and the neighbor's neglect, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
