They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their neighbor's dog attacking their own dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and chased theirs, but the author managed to pull it off. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time getting a hold of the smaller dog's neck. The author kicked the dog twice to make it let go, then threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. They also mentioned that the neighbor was apologetic but did nothing else to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and typical expectations regarding animal control. In many places, if an animal is a threat to others, the owner is responsible. If the neighbor's dog is aggressive and uncontrolled, they might be at fault for not keeping it leashed or properly contained. The author's actions were to protect their own pet. Kicking the dog could be seen as a defensive act to stop an immediate threat. However, using violence on another person's animal might have legal consequences, depending on the jurisdiction. Some places have strict laws against harming someone else's property, even if it's an animal that's attacking. The author's threats of killing the dog or calling animal control might also be problematic if they overstepped legally.\n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog has a history of aggression and they don't take measures to prevent it, like using a leash or a secure fence, they could be negligent. The neighbor's lack of action after the first incident might mean they are at fault for not preventing the second attack. However, the author's reaction could be justified as self-defense for their pet, but the method (kicking the dog) might be excessive. Alternatively, maybe the author should have used a non-lethal method to stop the attack, like using a water spray or a deterrent instead of physical force.\n\nAlso, threatening to kill the dog could be seen as extreme. While the neighbor's dog is dangerous, the author's threats might escalate the situation and could be considered threats against the neighbor. Legally, threatening harm to someone else's property (the dog) could have repercussions, depending on local laws. The author might have a valid reason to be angry, but their response might not be the most appropriate.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, protecting one's pet is understandable, but the method used matters. If the author acted in the moment to prevent harm to their own dog, that's a defense of property and safety. However, after the fact, threatening to kill the dog without legal justification could be problematic. The neighbor might be in the wrong for not controlling their dog, but the author's actions could also be excessive. It's a bit of a gray area where both parties might have faults. The author might not be the asshole here because they were defending their pet, but their response could be considered over the top. The neighbor's negligence is definitely a problem, but the author's threats and violence might not be justified either.\n"
