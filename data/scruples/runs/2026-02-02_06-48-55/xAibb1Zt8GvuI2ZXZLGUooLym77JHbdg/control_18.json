They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong after hurting their neighbor's dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The neighbor got a large dog, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix, which the author is worried about because their own dog is small. The first incident, the dog jumps the wall and attacks, the author tries to stop it. The next day, the same dog leaps again and gets on the author's dog's neck. The author kicks the dog twice, harder the second time, to make it let go. Then, they threaten the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happens again, and also mention doing something if the neighbor's dog trespasses again. The neighbor just apologizes but doesn't take action.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider: \n\n1. **Protecting a pet**: The author's primary motivation was to protect their small dog from a potentially dangerous attack. The neighbor's dog did jump the wall and attack each time, so there's a legitimate concern about the safety of their pet. In some cases, using reasonable force to protect your pet might be justified, but the exact circumstances matter. The author kicked the dog, which could be seen as aggressive. However, in the heat of the moment, if the dog was attacking, maybe the author felt they had no choice.\n\n2. **Threats**: The author made explicit threats to either call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. Then, they mentioned taking action against the neighbor if the dog trespassed again. Threats of violence, even if justified by the situation, can be problematic. Using the term \"kill it\" is a direct threat, which might be considered over the line, regardless of the provocation. Even if the neighbor's dog is dangerous, the author's response with such a severe threat could be seen as the problem here.\n\n3. **Neighbor's responsibility**: The neighbor didn't take action after the first incident, which is their responsibility. They should have ensured the dog is contained, maybe by fixing the fence or using a leash. However, the neighbor's apathy might not excuse the author's threats. The neighbor could also be in the wrong for not being more proactive, but that's a separate issue.\n\n4. **Legal and ethical considerations**: In many places, it's illegal to harm someone else's property, even if it's a dog that's attacking yours. The author's response might be considered excessive. Instead of using physical force, especially potentially harmful kicks, they should have taken steps like calling the neighbor immediately, using non-lethal deterrents, or contacting animal control after the first incident. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a serious statement and could lead to legal issues. The neighbor might be negligent, but the author's response could be seen as escalating the situation.\n\n5. **Communication**: The author tried to communicate their concerns, but after two incidents, the response was to threaten rather than discuss solutions. Perhaps a better approach would have been to talk to the neighbor about securing their dog, maybe requesting a meeting to express the danger. The author's direct threats might not be the right way to handle it, even if the neighbor's dog is the cause.\n\nSo, while the neighbor is definitely at fault for not properly containing their dog, the author's actions in kicking the dog and making threats could be seen as crossing the line. The author should prioritize non-violent solutions and possibly legal or community resources instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was excessive and involved threats of violence, which is not advisable regardless of the provocation.\n"
