They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. So, the situation is that the neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's small dog. The first time, the author physically pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog was attacking again, the author kicked it twice to make it let go. The neighbors didn't seem to take it seriously and just said sorry. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, animal owners are responsible for their pets. If a dog is a danger to others, the owner might be liable. The neighbor's dog was unprovoked and aggressive, which could make them at fault. The author's actions were in defense of their own dog. Kicking the dog to prevent injury might be seen as necessary to protect their pet. However, using force could have legal implications depending on local laws. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a serious threat, which might be problematic even if justified by the situation.\n\nBut the context is that the neighbor's dog is a danger. The author tried to prevent harm twice. The neighbor's apathy is concerning because they didn't take steps to secure their dog. The author's threats might be a reaction to the neighbor's negligence. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog could be legally actionable, even if the dog is dangerous. The author might have the right to call animal control, but threatening to do so themselves could be an issue.\n\nEthically, protecting one's own pet is understandable. The author might feel they had no choice. But the method of kicking the dog and the threats could be seen as excessive. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely a problem. The author's right to defend their property (their dog) is a factor here. However, the line between defense and aggression might be thin. In some jurisdictions, you can't harm another person's property (the dog) unless it's in self-defense or to prevent imminent harm. If the dog was actively attacking, the author's intervention might be justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the neighbor is likely at fault for not controlling their dog and being apathetic. The author acted to protect their own dog, which is a valid concern. The kicking might be necessary in the moment, but threats to kill the dog could be problematic. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions might be seen as a reasonable response to an immediate threat. The neighbor's inaction is a bigger issue. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their threats might be a point of contention. Still, since the dog was a direct threat to their own pet, the author's actions are more defensive. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but the threats might make it a gray area. However, in the heat of the moment, protecting one's pet is a strong justification. So I think the answer is B.\n"
