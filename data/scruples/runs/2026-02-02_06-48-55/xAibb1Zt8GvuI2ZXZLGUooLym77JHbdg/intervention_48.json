They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a neighbor's dog that attacked their own pet. The story is about a pitbull/German shepherd mix named Beef Boy that jumped the wall twice and attacked the smaller dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the second time they kicked it when it had their dog's neck.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and morality of the situation. If the neighbor's dog is unprovoked and the author is trying to protect their pet, there might be a case for self-defense. But if the dog was off-leash and not properly controlled, the neighbor might be at fault for not keeping it contained. \n\nIn the first incident, the author reacted by pulling the dog off, which seems like a reasonable defensive action. The second time, when the dog had their dog's neck, they kicked it. The question is whether that was excessive. The author's intent was to stop the attack and save their pet's life. Legally, in many places, using reasonable force to protect one's property or animals might be acceptable. However, the line between defense and excessive force can be thin. Kicking the dog hard could potentially cause harm, so it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they repeatedly failed to control their dog, that's negligent. But the author's threat to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as over the top. Threatening to kill could be problematic, even if in a moment of anger. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did act to protect their pet, which is understandable. But the use of physical force and the threats might be considered excessive or threatening. However, the neighbor's lack of action could be contributing to the problem. It's possible the author is partially right in wanting to protect their dog but maybe used a bit too much force and made aggressive threats. But the neighbor is definitely negligent for not securing their dog. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can use necessary force to prevent harm to your animal. Kicking once might not be a big issue, but doing it again harder could be a problem. The author's final threat is the biggest issue here. Threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious matter and could lead to legal consequences. \n\nSo the answer might be A, but I need to consider if the author was justified. If the dog was unprovoked and their own pet was in immediate danger, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the threats are a red flag. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but the neighbor's negligence is also part of the problem. \n\nI think the key points are the immediate threat to the dog, the neighbor's failure to control their pet, and the author's response. The kicking might be justified in the moment, but the threats are problematic. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the threats but not for the initial action. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. If both parties share some blame, but the main issue is the neighbor's negligence, the answer might still be B. But if the author's actions and threats cross the line, then A. \n\nHm, the user says \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), so the community often looks at both sides. The neighbor isn't doing their part, but the author's actions could be seen as aggressive. However, in the context of protecting a life, maybe the author is justified. The problem is the threats. But the action of kicking might be within the bounds of defense. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, but the neighbor is. The answer would be B (No), but with the note that the threats are a problem. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the main action was the kicking, which was in response to an attack, I lean towards B.\n"
