They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation involved two incidents where the neighbor's large dog attacked the user's smaller dog. The user kicked the dog twice to get it off their dog, and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large breed that jumped a wall and attacked the smaller dog. The user acted to protect their pet, which is understandable. However, using force like kicking the dog might be questionable. In many places, people have the right to defend their animals, but the method matters. Kicking could be excessive, especially if there's a risk of harming the neighbor's property (the dog). Also, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be seen as overstepping.\n\nNext, the neighbor's response was just an apology without taking action to prevent future incidents. That's a problem because the owner has a responsibility to control their pet. However, the user's reaction involved physical harm to the dog and threats, which could legally be an issue. Depending on local laws, using force to protect one's property or animals is allowed, but it's usually within reason. Kicking the dog might be considered excessive, leading to possible legal consequences like liability for damaging the neighbor's property.\n\nThe user also made threats, which can be problematic. While understandable due to the stress, threats of violence or harming someone else's pet aren't advisable and could escalate the situation. The neighbor might have legal recourse if the dog was injured unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor failed to control their dog, which is a significant factor. They didn't take steps to prevent the dog from trespassing or attacking, which is their responsibility. The user's actions were in response to an immediate threat to their pet, which might be justified in self-defense terms for the pet. However, the methods used (kicking) and subsequent threats might not be the best approach.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your animals. Kicking might not be considered reasonable here. The user should have tried to separate the dogs safely, maybe using objects to create a barrier or calling for help. Threatening to kill the dog is a serious matter and could lead to legal issues, even if the dog was a threat.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, while the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the user's actions might also be problematic. The key points are the method of defense (kicking) and the threats. Depending on local laws, the user could be in the wrong for using excessive force and making threats. However, if the user acted in immediate self-defense to protect their pet, there might be some leniency. But generally, the threats and the method used suggest the user might have overreacted. Therefore, the answer leans towards the user being in the wrong (A), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
