They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about two neighbors: the author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a larger pitbull/German shepherd mix. The author's dog is smaller, so there's a risk. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks the author's dog twice. The first time, the author pulls the dog off. The second time, the neighbor's dog attacks again, and the author kicks it twice. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor just says sorry without taking action.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. They answer A if yes, B if no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's actions were in defense of their own dog, which is being attacked. The neighbor's dog is a large breed, which can be dangerous. The neighbor didn't take steps to secure the dog, like using a leash or keeping it contained. The author's reaction\u2014kicking the dog to save their own pet\u2014could be seen as a reasonable self-defense measure for the pet's safety. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control is a strong response. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's a concept of \"defensive measures\" for pets. If the dog is in immediate danger, using reasonable force to stop the attack might be justified. Kicking the dog twice could be considered necessary to save the life of their own animal. However, making threats against the neighbor's property (the dog) might cross a line. While the neighbor's inaction is concerning (not properly controlling their dog), the author's threats could be seen as threatening violence, which is illegal regardless of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is also at fault for not properly managing their dog, which is a known hazard. The author might feel justified in protecting their pet. However, the legal aspect varies. In many places, you can't use deadly force against another person's property unless it's to protect yourself. Since the dog is property, killing it might not be legal unless it's in the act of causing serious harm. But if the dog is attacking their own dog, which is their responsibility, there might be some legal leeway. \n\nThe author's threat to kill the dog if it attacks again could be problematic because it's a threat of violence against another person's property. However, the immediate action of kicking the dog when it was attacking could be seen as self-defense. Also, the neighbor's apathy in not taking responsibility for their dog's behavior is a factor. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for protecting their dog but could be in the wrong for the threats. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall, considering both actions (kicking the dog and threatening further action), it's a bit of a balance. Legally, using force to protect one's property (their dog) might be acceptable, but the threats could be an issue. However, in some places, if your property is being attacked, you can use reasonable force to defend it. \n\nIn terms of general moral judgment, people might side with the author because the neighbor didn't take responsibility, and the author acted to save their dog. But the threat to kill the dog might be seen as excessive. However, the immediate action of kicking the dog to save their own pet is more understandable. \n\nGiven all this, I think the author is not in the wrong for their actions during the attack, but their threats could be seen as over the line. However, since the main question is about whether they're the asshole, the community might be more lenient given the neighbor's negligence. So the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
