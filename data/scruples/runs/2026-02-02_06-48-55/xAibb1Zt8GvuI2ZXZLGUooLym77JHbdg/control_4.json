They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves two dogs, one owned by the author and the other by the neighbor. The neighbor's dog, Beef Boy, jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The author kicked the dog both times, and threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal control and self-defense for pets. In many places, you have a legal right to protect your property, which includes pets. If a dog is threatening or attacking your pet, you might be justified in taking action to stop it. Kicking the dog to prevent harm could be seen as a defensive act. However, the method of response matters. Kicking might be excessive depending on the situation, but given that the dog was attacking the smaller one, it could be argued it was necessary.\n\nThe author also threatened to kill the dog or call animal control. Threats of violence or harm might be problematic. While expressing anger is understandable, making specific threats could be considered inappropriate. However, if the neighbor's dog is a repeated danger, the author might be within their rights to consider legal actions like calling animal control, especially if the owner isn't taking responsibility.\n\nThe neighbor's response was apologetic but didn't take preventive measures. This lack of action from the neighbor is a point in the author's favor if they felt compelled to act. The neighbor's inaction could contribute to the necessity of the author's actions.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of handling the situation. The author could have considered other options first, like talking to the neighbor more seriously, using deterrents, or seeking mediation. However, given the immediate threat to their small dog, the author might feel that waiting for other measures wasn't an option.\n\nI need to balance the immediate danger to their pet against the actions taken. Kicking the dog to stop an attack is a common reaction, but could be seen as aggressive. However, in self-defense scenarios, especially for pets, it's often justified. The threats after the fact might be where the author is in the wrong. The key is whether the actions were proportionate to the threat. Given that the dog was attacking and the neighbor wasn't taking it seriously, the author's actions might be excusable, but the threats could tip the scale.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's main fault might be the threats rather than the physical action. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for the threats but not for defending their dog. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong at all, the answer would depend on which part is emphasized. The initial actions (kicking) are more defensive, but the threats could be problematic.\n"
