They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two dogs, one from the neighbor which jumped over the wall and attacked their smaller dog. The author kicked the neighbor's dog twice to get it to release their dog, then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large breed that managed to jump the wall twice and attack the smaller dog. The author acted to protect their own pet, which is a natural instinct. However, using physical force on another person's animal could be problematic. Legally, in some places, you might have the right to defend your property or animals, but there are limits. Kicking a dog, even in defense of your own pet, could be seen as excessive force, especially if the dog was already off the owner's property. The neighbor's apathy is also an issue; they didn't take steps to secure their dog, which might be their fault for not being responsible pet owners.\n\nBut the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog and threatening to kill it\u2014might cross a line. Threats to harm another person's property (the dog) could potentially lead to legal consequences. Even if done in self-defense, the method and the threats afterward might be considered aggressive. On the other hand, the neighbor's negligence in keeping their dog contained is a significant factor here. The author's motivation was to protect their own dog, which is understandable, but the response might not be the best approach. There might be better ways, like involving animal control or legal avenues, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The neighbor's negligence is a big part of the problem, but the author's use of force and threats could be seen as overreacting. Depending on local laws, using force to protect one's pet might be justified, but the specific actions taken (kicking and threatening to kill) might be considered excessive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but there's a strong argument that the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. So, while the neighbor is negligent, the author's response could be deemed inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive and aggressive, even if their intent was to protect their pet.\n"
