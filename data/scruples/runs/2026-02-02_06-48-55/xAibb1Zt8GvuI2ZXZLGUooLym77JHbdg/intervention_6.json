They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author has a small dog, and their new neighbor got a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog was attacking again, the author kicked it to get it off. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nSo, the key points here are self-defense for their pet. In many places, you can defend your property or pets if there's an immediate threat. The author's actions were to protect their own dog from a potentially dangerous situation. The neighbor's dog repeatedly attacked, and the owner didn't take responsibility, which might make the neighbor at fault.\n\nBut the author did kick the dog, which could be seen as using force. However, given the urgency of protecting their pet, some might argue it's justified. The threats of killing the dog or calling animal control are strong, but again, if the neighbor isn't taking precautions, the author might feel they have no other options.\n\nI need to consider laws about animal defense. In many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your animal from an immediate threat. Kicking might be considered reasonable in that split-second decision. However, threatening to kill someone's pet could be problematic, as that's a criminal act. The author's threats might push them into being at fault, but the main issue is the neighbor's lack of control over their dog.\n\nSo, the author's actions to protect their dog might be justified, but the threats could be an issue. However, given the context of repeated attacks and the neighbor's inaction, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The kicking could be justified as self-defense, but the threats might be over the line. However, the main wrong is the neighbor's failure to control their dog. The author's reaction is in response to that negligence.\n"
