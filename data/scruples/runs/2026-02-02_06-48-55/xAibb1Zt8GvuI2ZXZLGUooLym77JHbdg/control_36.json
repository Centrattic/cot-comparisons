They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about their neighbor's dog attacking their dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's big dog jumps the wall and goes after their small dog. They manage to pull it off. The next day, it happens again, and this time the neighbor's dog has the little dog by the neck. The author kicks the dog to get it off. The neighbor just apologizes but doesn't take any action. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again, and also threatens the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and typical responses in such situations. In many places, you have the right to protect your property, which includes your pets. If someone's animal is attacking your pet, you might be allowed to take reasonable steps to stop the attack. The author kicked the dog to protect their own, which could be seen as a reasonable reaction. However, threatening to kill the dog might be more problematic. While self-defense is allowed, threats of violence might cross a line. Also, the neighbor's inaction could be an issue, as they might be responsible for keeping their dog under control.\n\nBut then, the author's response was immediate and in the heat of the moment. They had a right to be protective of their pet. The neighbor's dog was uncontrolled, leading to two incidents. The author's threats might be excessive, but given the danger to their small dog, it's understandable. The key points here are whether the actions taken were proportionate. Kicking to stop the attack is likely okay, but the threats afterward might be where they went wrong. Also, they might have been better off contacting authorities instead of making threats. However, the neighbor's negligence in controlling the dog is also a factor. The author's actions were in defense of their pet, which can be justified. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here, but their threats are questionable. But the main question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they acted to protect their pet and the neighbor was negligent, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
