They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their neighbor's dog keeps jumping the wall and attacking their smaller dog. The first time, the author pulls the dog off, and the neighbor comes to get it. The next day, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks it to save their own dog. Then they threaten the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happens again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and ethical standards. In many places, you have a duty to try to protect your property and pets, but you can't use excessive force. Kicking a dog might be considered excessive, even in defense of another animal. But the dog was attacking the smaller dog, which could be a matter of self-defense for the pet. \n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is a known aggressive breed and they haven't taken proper precautions, like keeping it leashed or muzzled, they might be at fault. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action, which the author found unacceptable. The author's threat to kill the dog or call animal control is a strong reaction. Threats of violence against someone else's property can be legally problematic, even if motivated by fear.\n\nBut the author's primary concern is protecting their own pet. The dog's actions were dangerous, and the neighbor's inaction could be seen as negligence. The author's response might be seen as over the top in terms of threats, but their actions to stop the attack might be more justifiable. However, using physical force (kicking) could be an issue if it caused injury to the neighbor's dog. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a serious threat and could have legal consequences.\n\nIn terms of community standards, people often expect neighbors to handle such conflicts without violence. The author's approach, while understandable given the danger to their pet, might cross a line into threatening behavior. The neighbor's lack of action is also a problem, but that doesn't justify the author's threats. It's possible that the author was in a stressful situation, but the use of force and threats might still make them the asshole.\n"
