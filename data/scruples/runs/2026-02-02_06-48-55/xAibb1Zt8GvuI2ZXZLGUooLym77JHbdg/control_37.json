They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a small dog and a new neighbor with a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, after the neighbor did nothing to prevent it, the author kicked the dog to make it let go. Then the author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog again if it happened, and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nSo, the main points here: defending their own dog, the neighbor's lack of action, and the author's response. \n\nIn terms of the law, I think self-defense for pets might vary by location. In many places, you're allowed to protect your property, which includes pets. But using force that could harm the neighbor's dog might be a gray area. However, the dog was attacking the author's pet, so the immediate reaction to stop the attack could be justified. \n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is also a factor. If they knew their dog was aggressive and didn't take steps to control it, like keeping it on a leash or fixing the fence, they might be at fault. The author's threats might be problematic, but the context is that they were protecting their animal. \n\nBut the author did mention threatening to kill the dog if it happened again. Depending on local laws, that could be seen as a threat. But given the circumstances, it's a defensive measure. The main issue is whether the author's actions were reasonable under the situation. Since the dog attacked twice and the neighbor didn't act, the author's actions seem defensive. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there are any legal or ethical oversights. The author's response was in direct defense of their pet, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's apathy is a problem, but the author's actions were to protect their dog.\n"
