They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog attack on their pet. The writer kicked the neighbor's dog twice when it attacked their smaller dog. The key points here are self-defense of their pet, the neighbor's response, and whether the threat to call animal control or kill the dog is justified.\n\nFirst, the writer's actions: when their dog is being attacked, they kicked the larger dog to stop it. That seems like a reasonable immediate reaction to protect their pet. However, using physical force on an animal might be a point of contention. Some might argue that they should have called the neighbor or authorities instead of acting directly.\n\nThe neighbor's response is also important. The neighbor said sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatened the neighbor with consequences if it happened again. This part might be problematic. Making threats, even in a moment of anger, could be seen as overstepping, even if the neighbor was at fault for not controlling their dog.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is the asshole. From a legal standpoint, in some places you might have a right to protect your property (which pets are considered in some contexts), but using force could have its own issues. However, the emotional state after the attack might be considered\u2014people react in panic. The threat to \"kill\" the dog is a strong statement. Depending on the laws, threatening harm to someone's pet could potentially be problematic, but the context of protecting their own pet adds nuance.\n\nThe neighbor's failure to secure their dog properly is a significant factor. If the dog is known to be aggressive, the owners are responsible. But the writer's reaction includes a threat that might not be proportionate. The line between defending your pet and making threats that escalate the situation could be thin here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, the community might view the writer as justified in protecting their pet, especially after multiple incidents. However, the way they reacted (kicking the dog, making threats) might be seen as excessive, even if their intentions were good. The neighbor's apathy is also a problem, but the writer's response could lead to further conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the writer is in a tough spot. Their actions to protect their dog are understandable, but the threats and physical response might be seen as the wrong approach. However, the neighbor's inaction is also at fault. The answer hinges on whether the writer's actions are proportionate. Since they did act to save their pet immediately, maybe the kicking was necessary. But the threats afterward could be seen as over the top. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the immediate protection of their pet is a strong justification, even if the method was rough. The threats might not be the best approach, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to negligence and aggression.\n"
