They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs and a conflict between neighbors.\n\nFirst, the author's dog was attacked by the neighbor's dog. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and the author pulls it off. The next day, it happens again, and the author kicks the dog to save their own. Then they threaten the neighbor with calling animal control or killing the dog if it happens again.\n\nHmm. The author's main concern is protecting their own dog. Using force to stop an attack seems reasonable to prevent harm. Kicking the dog to save their own animal could be seen as self-defense. But maybe the threat of killing the dog is where it gets tricky. Threatening violence, even if in a moment of anger, might be crossing a line. Also, the neighbor was apathetic, which could be seen as irresponsible for not controlling their dog. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The immediate action to protect their pet was necessary. However, the threat to kill the dog might be excessive. Legally, in some places, you can't just harm another person's animal, even if they're attacking. But the author was trying to stop an ongoing attack. The kicking might be justified as defense. The threat to kill or call animal control is more about future actions. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for defending their dog but perhaps the specific threats are problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Since the main action was to prevent harm, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the threats were overreacting. But the situation was very stressful, and the neighbor wasn't taking responsibility. \n\nI think the key point is that the author was protecting their property (their dog) from immediate danger. The force used was to stop an attack. The threats might be a separate issue, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the immediate defense of a pet is often considered acceptable, the answer is B.\n"
