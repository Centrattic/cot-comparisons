They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their dog twice, and the author responds by kicking the dog and threatening to call animal control or kill it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked their smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to intervene. The second time, they kicked the dog twice when it had their dog by the neck. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again.\n\nNow, the key points here are: self-defense for their pet, the neighbor's responsibility to control their dog, and the appropriateness of the author's response. In many places, the law allows you to protect your property, including pets, from immediate harm. However, the use of force needs to be reasonable. Kicking someone else's dog could lead to legal consequences, but if the dog is attacking your pet, some might argue it's necessary to stop it.\n\nBut the threat to kill the dog or call animal control is another aspect. Threats can escalate situations, but if the dog is a danger to people or animals, maybe the author has a right to take action. However, threatening to kill might not be the best approach. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem\u2014if their dog is not properly restrained, they could be at fault for allowing the dog to trespass and cause harm.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author acted to protect their pet, which is understandable. But the method (kicking) and the threats might be seen as excessive. On the other hand, the neighbor didn't take steps to control their dog, which is their responsibility. So who is more at fault?\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, the neighbor might be liable for their dog's actions if it's not properly controlled. But the author's actions could be seen as self-defense. However, using physical force on another person's property (the dog) might not be legally sound. The author's threats could be problematic if they escalate the situation, but the neighbor's negligence in controlling the dog is a significant issue.\n\nIn terms of morality, protecting your pet from immediate danger is a strong point for the author. However, threatening to kill the dog might be seen as extreme, even if justified by the circumstances. The author might be in the right to protect their dog but perhaps overreacted in the method and the threats made afterward.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But if I had to choose between A and B, I think the author might not be in the wrong, as they were protecting their pet, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the answer depends on cultural or legal standards. Since the options are A (author in wrong) or B (not), I might lean towards B because protecting one's pet from attack can be seen as justifiable, even if the method is questionable. But maybe there's a middle ground where the author could have taken other steps first, like contacting the neighbor or authorities instead of using force. Hmm. Still, the immediate threat to their dog's life is a critical factor here. So I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
