They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a small dog and a neighbor got a large, possibly aggressive pitbull/german shepard mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Self-defense for pets: in many places, you can protect your animals from immediate harm. The author's dog was in danger, so kicking the other dog to stop the attack might be considered reasonable. However, using force that could harm the neighbor's dog might depend on local laws. Also, the author threatened to kill the dog if it happened again. That's a strong threat and could be problematic.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility: They might be at fault for not keeping their dog under control. If the dog is a known aggressive breed and they didn't use a leash or secure fencing, they could be negligent. But the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog\u2014could be seen as excessive, especially if the dog was not an immediate threat. However, in the moment, the author was trying to save their dog's life.\n\nThe threats: Saying you'll kill someone's dog if they don't control it is a serious threat. Depending on the context, that could be considered harassment or intimidation. But if the dog is a real threat to their pet, the threat might be seen as a last resort.\n\nLocal laws vary. In some places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property (including animals). Kicking might be considered reasonable if it stops the attack. However, threatening to kill could cross a line. The neighbor's inaction is also a factor\u2014they might be liable for their dog's actions if it's not controlled.\n\nSo, putting it together: The author was protecting their dog from a dangerous situation. Their actions during the attack (kicking) might be justified, but the threat afterward could be problematic. However, given the neighbor's lack of action and the dog's repeated aggression, the author's response might be understandable. The answer hinges on whether the actions were proportionate and if the threats are excessive. But since the author was defending their pet under immediate threat, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
