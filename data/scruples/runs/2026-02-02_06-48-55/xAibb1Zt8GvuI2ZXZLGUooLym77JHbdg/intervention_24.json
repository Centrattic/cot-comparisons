They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor's dog keeps jumping the wall and attacking the author's dog. The first time, the dog jumps over and the author tries to pull it off. The second time, the dog grabs the author's dog by the neck, and the author kicks the dog. The neighbor apologizes but doesn't take action. The author threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again.\n\nHmm, first, the neighbor's dog is clearly a problem. The author has a small dog that's at risk. The first incident, the dog jumps over and attacks. The author tried to intervene. The second time, since the dog was holding the smaller dog by the neck, the author kicked it to get it off. That seems like self-defense for their pet. But then, the author threatens to kill the dog if it happens again. That's more aggressive. Threatening someone's pet can be a problem, especially if it's not in immediate danger.\n\nBut then again, the neighbor seems apathetic. They didn't take steps to secure the dog after the first incident. Maybe the author felt cornered. However, using violence against the dog, even in self-defense, might be legally questionable. Also, threatening to kill someone else's dog could have legal repercussions. The neighbor's inconsiderate, but does that excuse the author's threats?\n\nThe key points are: the author acted to protect their dog from an immediate threat, which is understandable. But the after-the-fact threats might cross a line. The kicking could be justified as necessary to stop the attack, but the threats of violence or calling animal control might be overstepping. It's a tough situation. The author's actions to protect their pet are sympathetic, but the threats could be seen as the problem. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because of the threats and the violent response, even if the initial action was in self-defense. But I'm not sure. Different people might see it differently. The neighbor is definitely negligent in keeping their dog contained, but the author's reaction might be excessive beyond the immediate action. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
