They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the person reacting by threatening to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the user's dog. The user physically intervened by kicking the dog to save their own. After the second incident, the user threatened the neighbor with serious consequences if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nNow, the user is self-reflecting, wondering if they overreacted. The key points here are the justification for self-defense and the appropriateness of the threats. Legally, in many places, you have the right to protect your property and pets from immediate harm. Kicking the dog to stop it from attacking could be seen as a reasonable act of self-defense for the pet. However, the threat to \"kill\" the dog might be more problematic. While angry, such a threat could be considered excessive, depending on local laws. Threats of violence might escalate the situation and could lead to legal issues, even if the intent is to protect.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility is a factor. They should have controlled their dog, especially if it's a large breed. The fact that they only apologized but didn't take measures like leashing the dog or using a fence suggests negligence on their part. The user's frustration is understandable, given the risk to their small dog.\n\nHowever, the user's response includes a threat to kill the dog, which is a serious statement. Even if the user's intention was to prevent future attacks, the wording might be seen as aggressive. The appropriate course might have been to call animal control during an incident or discuss the issue with the neighbor to find a solution, like keeping the dog contained.\n\nIn terms of morality, while protecting one's pet is justified, the threat could be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that the user is not in the wrong for defending their dog, but the specific threat might be an overreaction. The balance between self-defense and escalation is delicate here.\n\nLegally and ethically, using physical force to protect a pet is generally acceptable, but the threat to kill another person's animal without involving authorities might be questionable. It's possible that the user's actions in kicking the dog were justified, but the verbal threats could be where they went wrong. However, given the urgency of the situation, some might argue that the threat was a necessary warning to prevent future harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor is clearly negligent in controlling their dog, the user's threat might be seen as an overreaction. The user's actions to protect their dog were appropriate, but the specific threats could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards A (the user is in the wrong) for the threats, but considering the context, there's nuance. However, based on the options given, the most accurate answer is likely A.\n"
