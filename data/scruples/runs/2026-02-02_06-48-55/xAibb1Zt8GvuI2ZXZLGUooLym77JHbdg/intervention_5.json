They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors with dogs. The writer's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor got a large, beefy pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The writer is worried because the big dog could hurt their small dog.\n\nFirst incident: The neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks the writer's dog. The writer tries to pull it off, their dog runs back in, and the neighbor retrieves their dog. The writer then decides they won't be gentle next time if it happens again.\n\nSecond incident: The next day, the same thing happens. The writer's dog is attacked, and the writer kicks the neighbor's dog twice to get it off. The neighbor apologizes but doesn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The writer threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again and warns the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nThe writer is now questioning if they overreacted.\n\nNow, considering the laws and typical expectations. In many places, you can defend your property and pets if they're in immediate danger. If a dog is attacking, using reasonable force to stop it might be justified. Kicking the dog twice might be seen as a reasonable reaction to prevent injury to their own pet.\n\nHowever, the threats made\u2014like calling animal control or killing the dog\u2014could be problematic. Threats of violence might not be legally justified, even if the initial action was in self-defense. Also, the neighbor's lack of action might have contributed to the problem, but the writer's response could be seen as escalating the conflict.\n\nBut the key here is whether the writer's actions were proportionate. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be acceptable, but the verbal threats and the warning about trespassing might cross a line. The neighbor might have a responsibility to control their dog, but the writer's response could be seen as over the top in terms of threats.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, using force to protect your pet from an attack is allowed, but the level of force should be reasonable. Kicking twice to stop an attack on a small dog might be considered reasonable. However, the threats of killing the dog or calling animal control could be seen as excessive, depending on the laws. Some places have specific laws about how to handle dog attacks.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem, but the writer's response in threatening to kill the dog might be legally and ethically questionable. Even if the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the writer has to follow proper procedures, like reporting the incident to authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, the writer might have acted in self-defense to protect their dog, which is understandable, but the threats and the language used could be problematic. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the specific laws of their area, but generally, using force to stop an attack is justified up to a point. The threats and the way they handled the situation might make them the asshole in the eyes of some, especially if they didn't follow proper legal steps.\n"
