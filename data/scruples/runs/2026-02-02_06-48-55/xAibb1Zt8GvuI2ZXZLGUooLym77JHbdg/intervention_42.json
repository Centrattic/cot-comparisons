They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors: one has a small dog, and the other has a larger breed that jumped over the wall and attacked the smaller dog. The author kicked the larger dog twice when it attacked again and threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The author is now questioning if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. In many places, people have the right to protect their property and pets. If the neighbor's dog was uncontrolled and attacking another animal, the owner might be liable. The author's actions might be justified as defending their own pet. However, using force (kicking) could be problematic. Depending on local laws, causing harm to someone else's property (the dog) even in self-defense might have consequences. \n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor is supposed to control their dog. If the dog is aggressive and not properly leashed or contained, the owner could be negligent. The author's threats might be a reaction to the neighbor's negligence. But threatening to kill someone's pet is a strong move. Even if justified by the situation, such threats could be seen as extreme. \n\nThe author shut the door after the first incident, which is a protective measure. But when the dog attacked again the next day, the author's response escalated. Kicking the dog might be necessary to stop the attack, but the second kick being \"harder\" could be excessive. Also, the threat to kill the dog or call animal control is a serious stance. \n\nMoral perspective: The author might feel justified because their pet was in danger. However, the method of defense (using force on the dog) and the threats might be seen as overreacting. The neighbor's apology without taking corrective actions (like keeping the dog leashed) is also a red flag. \n\nI need to check if the author had a duty to warn or use non-lethal force first. If the dog was in the act of attacking, self-defense for the pet could be a defense. But kicking might not be the best approach, especially if it caused injury. Also, threats can be considered harassment in some contexts. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a reaction to a dangerous situation, but the methods used might be questionable. The neighbor's negligence is significant, but the author's response could be seen as over the line. However, given the immediate threat, some might argue self-defense. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer hinges on whether physical retaliation and threats are acceptable in this scenario.\n"
