They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author had a small dog, and the neighbor got a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The big dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the small dog. The first time, the author tried to stop it. The second time, the big dog was on the small one's neck, so the author kicked it to get it off. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and also warned about trespassing.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, self-defense for pets. In many jurisdictions, you can take reasonable measures to protect your property or pets. Kicking the dog to stop an attack could be seen as a defensive action. However, using force that exceeds what's necessary might be an issue. But in this case, if the dog was actively attacking and the owner was unresponsive, the author might have felt justified.\n\nSecond, the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor's dog kept escaping and attacking. The neighbor didn't do anything to prevent it, which is a problem. Dog owners are typically responsible for their pets' actions. If a dog is dangerous, the owner should take steps to prevent harm. The neighbor's apathy is a red flag. \n\nThird, the author's threats. Threatening to kill the dog could be seen as escalation. While understandable given the situation, making such a threat might be crossing a line, depending on local laws. Some places have specific laws about dealing with aggressive dogs, and threatening to kill might not be advisable. However, if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, the author might feel justified in considering extreme measures, especially if they fear for their pet's safety. \n\nAlso, trespassing. The neighbor's dog was on the author's property. The author has the right to protect their property, so warning the neighbor about trespassing is reasonable. \n\nHowever, the author's actions need to be evaluated. Kicking the dog was a direct reaction to protect their pet. If the dog was in the act of attacking, it might be considered a reasonable response. But if there are safer ways to protect the pet, like calling the authorities or using deterrents, maybe kicking is excessive. \n\nThe neighbor's failure to control the dog is a significant factor. In many places, dog owners are liable for their pets' actions, and repeated incidents could lead to legal consequences for the owner. The author might have a case if the dog is deemed dangerous. \n\nBut the author's threats to kill the dog could be problematic. While understandable, using lethal force might require justification. If the dog is a threat to the small dog, and the owner isn't acting, the author might need to document the incidents and involve authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of the question: \"Is the author in the wrong?\" The main issue is the author's use of force and threats. While protecting their pet is a valid concern, threatening to kill another person's dog without legal recourse could be seen as overstepping. However, the neighbor's negligence is a key part of this. If the neighbor is negligent, the author might not be the asshole, but their threats might be the problem. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The author's actions were in self-defense and protecting their pet. However, the threats might be a gray area. But given the neighbor's inaction and the dog's repeated aggression, the author's response is more defensive. So, overall, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
