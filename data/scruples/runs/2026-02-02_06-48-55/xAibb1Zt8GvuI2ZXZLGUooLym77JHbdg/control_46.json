They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The story is about their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the author defending their dog by kicking the neighbor's dog. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if an animal is threatening someone or another animal, the owner might have the right to protect their property. But there might be limits on how they do that. Kicking a dog could be seen as excessive force, depending on the circumstances. Did the author have a right to use physical force to protect their dog?\n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked. The neighbor's response was just to say sorry each time without taking action. That seems negligent. If a dog is known to be aggressive, the owner might be legally responsible for any damage or injuries caused. The author might have a case against the neighbor for negligence.\n\nBut the author's actions: kicking the dog. Even if in self-defense or protective of their pet, using violence on another person's property (the neighbor's dog) could lead to legal issues. The neighbor might claim assault on their animal, depending on local laws. So even if the neighbor is at fault, the author's method of defense could be problematic.\n\nAlso, threatening to kill the dog is a serious threat. Depending on jurisdiction, threatening to kill someone else's animal might be considered a criminal threat or could lead to charges. The author's threats could put them in legal trouble, even if the neighbor was negligent.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of protecting one's own property (the dog) from harm. The author might argue that they were protecting their pet from immediate danger. However, the method used (kicking) might be excessive. Maybe using a leash, calling animal control, or other non-lethal methods would be more appropriate.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. The neighbor is definitely at fault for not controlling their dog and not taking responsibility. The author's reaction to kick the dog might be justified in the heat of the moment to save their pet, but the threat to kill the dog or the neighbor could be problematic. Legally, the author might be in a gray area. Depending on the laws in their area, using force to protect their pet might be acceptable up to a point, but threatening to kill might cross the line. \n\nIt also depends on whether the author's actions were proportionate. If the dog was actively attacking, kicking could be considered a reasonable response to get it to release their dog. However, repeated threats and the statement about \"kill it\" might not be legally protected. \n\nIn some places, you have the right to defend your property, but there are limits. The author's actions might be seen as self-defense for their pet, but the threats could lead to charges. The neighbor's negligence is a separate issue, but the author's response might still be considered in the wrong for their aggressive actions and threats. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be partially at fault for their threats and the method of defense, even though the neighbor was negligent. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats and possible excessive force, even if the neighbor is also at fault.\n"
