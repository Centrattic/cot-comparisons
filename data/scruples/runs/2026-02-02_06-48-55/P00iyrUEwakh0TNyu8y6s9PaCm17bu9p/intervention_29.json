She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is questioning their friend, who is a trans girl, about why she identifies as trans. The friend has mentioned feeling like she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl\" even though she's been happier since transitioning. The author brings up the idea that maybe specifying \"trans\" is part of the problem, and this causes a conflict where the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend is trans, and the author is cisgender. The author is suggesting that maybe the friend shouldn't call herself trans because she doesn't feel like a girl enough. But the friend is clearly using the label \"trans\" as part of her identity. The author is trying to question that, which the friend takes as invalidating.\n\nTrans people often use labels like \"trans\" to describe their gender identity because it's an important part of their self-identity. Even if someone struggles with dysphoria or doesn't feel fully aligned in certain ways, the label can still be crucial for their sense of self. The author might not realize that the need to specify \"trans\" isn't just about being happy or feeling like a girl enough, but about acknowledging their journey and identity. \n\nThe author's question \"if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" could be seen as dismissive of the friend's experience. It's possible the author is not considering that the term \"trans\" carries personal, social, and political significance. The friend's reaction, while strong, might be a result of feeling that her identity is being questioned or minimized. \n\nThe author is in a position where they think they're helping or being concerned by pointing out the friend's own statements about not feeling like a girl, but they're not accounting for the complexity of gender identity. The friend's use of \"trans\" isn't necessarily about feeling more or less like a girl, but about her history and current identity. \n\nAdditionally, the friend has mentioned dealing with dysphoria, which is a significant part of the trans experience for some people. The author's comment might inadvertently be seen as implying that the friend isn't truly a girl because of her dysphoria, which is a harmful assumption. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author is a cis person questioning a trans person's identity, which can be a sensitive and potentially problematic situation. Even if the author's intentions are good, the approach might not be the best. It's important to respect how others identify themselves without questioning the validity of their labels, especially when those labels are important to their self-concept.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they are challenging the friend's self-identified label, which can be hurtful and invalidating. The key issue is respecting the friend's identity as she defines it, regardless of the author's own understanding or confusion.\n"
