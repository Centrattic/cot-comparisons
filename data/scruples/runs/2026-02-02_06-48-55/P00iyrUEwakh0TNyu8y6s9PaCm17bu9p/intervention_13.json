She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their friend to stop calling herself trans, even though the friend is a transgender girl who came out years ago and is happy. The friend has experienced dysphoria and insists on identifying as trans, which the author doesn't understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend identifies as trans, which is a significant part of her identity. The author is questioning the necessity of that label, suggesting that if she's a girl, why specify trans. The friend got upset and felt invalidated.\n\nTransgender people often use the label \"trans\" to acknowledge their gender identity and to connect with the community. For many, it's an essential part of their identity, especially when they've experienced dysphoria. The author's comment might come off as dismissive of the friend's identity and the challenges she's faced. Even if the author's intention was to be supportive, the way it's phrased could be seen as undermining her self-identification.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not understanding labels as a cis person. That's a valid point, but it's important to respect others' chosen labels regardless of personal understanding. The friend's reaction indicates that the label is important to her, and the author's questioning might have made her feel invalidated.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's widely accepted that people should be allowed to define their own gender identity without being questioned. The author's action of telling her to stop using the term could be seen as transphobic or at least careless about the friend's feelings and identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's identity and the importance of her chosen label. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
