She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a transgender girl who has experienced dysphoria and transitioned, but still doesn't feel entirely like a girl. The author's issue is that the friend includes \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author is confused why she needs the label.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of dysphoria and transitioned, so the term \"trans\" is part of her identity. The author questions the necessity of the label, which might come off as dismissive. The friend reacted strongly, feeling hurt and defensive. \n\nThe key here is understanding that for many trans individuals, the label \"trans\" is important for self-identification and community. Even if the person is happy with their transition, the term can be a significant part of their identity. The author's suggestion might have invalidated the friend's experience by implying that the label isn't necessary, which could be seen as minimizing the friend's journey and the meaning behind the term. \n\nAlso, the author admits they're cis, so their perspective might not account for the importance of labels in the trans community. The friend's strong reaction (\"you're an a-hole\") indicates that the author crossed a line by questioning her identity in a way that was hurtful. \n\nIn such cases, the right approach is to respect the person's self-identification without questioning their need for labels. The author's comment, while perhaps made from a place of confusion, was hurtful and dismissive. Therefore, the author is more likely in the wrong here.\n"
