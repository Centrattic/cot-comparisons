She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning for years and is happy but mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling \"enough like a girl.\" The author brought up why she insists on labeling herself as trans, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a cis person trying to understand their trans friend's identity. The friend uses \"trans\" as part of her identity, which is important for many trans people. The author's comment seems to question the necessity of the label, which might invalidate the friend's experience. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to help or understand better, the approach taken could be seen as dismissive. Using labels like \"trans\" is often about self-identification and community belonging. The friend's reaction indicates that the topic is sensitive and personal. The author might not realize that the label isn't just about the gender itself but also about the journey and identity tied to transitioning.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend has dealt with dysphoria. This suggests that transition is an ongoing process, and the use of \"trans\" might be part of her current identity despite ongoing challenges. The author's question could come across as minimizing her experiences or implying that her identity is conditional on how much she feels a certain way.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's generally advised not to question someone's self-identification, especially regarding gender. The author might not have considered that the friend might need the label for validation or to connect with others in the trans community. The friend's anger stems from feeling misunderstood or judged.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by questioning the necessity of the label. Even if the intent was to be helpful, the impact was negative. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's identity and didn't respect the importance of her chosen labels.\n"
