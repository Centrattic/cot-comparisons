She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's look at this situation. The author is questioning whether they were wrong to tell their transgender friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend has been transitioning for years, is happy, but sometimes mentions not feeling like a girl enough. The author's issue is that the friend includes \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author thinks maybe that's part of her problems.\n\nFirst, understanding the context: The friend is transgender and has transitioned. The author is cisgender, so they might not grasp the significance of labels. For many trans people, identifying as trans is important for several reasons. It can be a part of their identity, a way to acknowledge their journey, and to raise awareness or connect with others who share similar experiences. \n\nThe author's action was to question the necessity of the term \"trans\" in the friend's self-identification. The friend took offense, which is understandable. The author's confusion comes from not seeing the need for the label, but for the trans person, the label might be crucial. The author's comment could come off as minimizing the friend's experience. Even if the friend is happy, the term \"trans\" might still hold importance for her identity beyond just her current happiness. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was to directly question the friend about it, which might have been insensitive. The friend's reaction of being upset and feeling judged shows that the author's words were hurtful. The author might not realize that the label is a personal choice and part of self-expression, not just a problem to be solved. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably was in the wrong. They didn't respect the friend's choice to identify as trans, even if it's part of her identity despite any ongoing dysphoria. The answer is A.\n"
