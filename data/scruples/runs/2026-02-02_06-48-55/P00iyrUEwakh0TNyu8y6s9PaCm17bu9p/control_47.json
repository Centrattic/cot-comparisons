She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is a transgender girl (assigned male at birth) who's been out for years and is happy. However, she still experiences dysphoria and says she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author is confused because the friend insists on using \"trans\" in her identity, like \"trans girl,\" instead of just \"girl.\" The author questions why she needs the label, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about identity labels and understanding the importance of self-identification. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp why the label matters. Transgender individuals often use the term to affirm their identity, especially when their gender doesn't match their assigned sex at birth. Even if someone is happy in their current identity, the label is a part of their journey and self-expression. The author's question could be seen as dismissive of her identity, even if unintended. \n\nThe user might be testing if the author respects her friend's autonomy in self-identification. The friend's reaction (\"it's not that simple\") suggests that her use of the term is significant. The author's approach might be minimizing her feelings, which could be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, respecting someone's chosen identity and labels is generally considered important. Even if the author's intent was to be supportive, not considering the friend's perspective on labels could be a mistake. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her identity markers.\n\nAnswer: A\n"
