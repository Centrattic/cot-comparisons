She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been transitioning for years and is happy but still has dysphoria. The author noticed she keeps emphasizing \"trans\" when referring to herself, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"a girl.\" The author questioned that, and the friend was upset.\n\nHmm, so the author is wondering if they're the a**hole here. The key points here are about understanding how transgender individuals identify themselves. The author is a cis person, so maybe they don't grasp the significance of labeling as trans. The friend includes \"trans\" in her identity, which for many transgender people is an important part of their self-identification. Even if someone is happy with their transition, the term \"trans\" might still hold importance for their identity, especially in a culture where trans visibility is important. \n\nThe author's question, \"Well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" might come off as invalidating. The friend's reaction of being upset and defensive suggests that the label is important to her. The author might not realize that for some people, specifying \"trans\" is a way to acknowledge their journey, to be part of a community, or to clarify their identity to others. It's not just about the label itself but the meaning and context behind it. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the friend has ongoing dysphoria. Even if she's happier, dysphoria can persist, and using the term \"trans\" might help her navigate that part of her life. The author's lack of understanding here might be the issue. They might be minimizing the importance of the label, which can be a sensitive topic. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about respecting someone's chosen identity labels. Even if the author's intention was to be supportive, questioning the necessity of the label in that way could be seen as dismissive. The friend's reaction shows that the label is important to her, so the author's approach might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's chosen identity markers and may have unintentionally invalidated her experience.\n"
