She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their trans friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning and is happy, but sometimes mentions not feeling enough like a girl. The author felt uncomfortable when the friend kept using \"trans\" in her identity statements, so they asked why she needed to specify that. The friend got upset, and the author is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of transgender identity. For many trans people, the label \"trans\" is an important part of their identity. It can signify their journey, their experience, and their community. Even if someone is happy in their identity, the need to specify \"trans\" might be about visibility, self-identification, or acknowledging their history. The author's question, while coming from a place of genuine confusion (as a cis person), might not take into account the emotional and social significance that the term holds for the trans community.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems strong, but it's also valid. When someone is told that their self-identification is unnecessary or problematic, even if it's a well-meaning question, it can feel invalidating. The author's approach might have been to question the necessity of the term without understanding the personal and social reasons behind it. In such cases, it's important to respect the individual's identity and the terms they choose to use for themselves, rather than trying to minimize or question it.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning is that maybe the friend's problems stem from over-reliance on labels. However, this is a common cis-centric misunderstanding. For many trans people, labels are empowering and help them connect with others. The author's suggestion that the friend might not \"feel enough like a girl\" could inadvertently suggest that there's a right or wrong way to feel, which can be hurtful. Trans individuals should be able to define their own identity without external judgment, even if they experience dysphoria or complex feelings.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author's question might come off as dismissive or not taking the friend's identity seriously. The friend might have felt that the author was questioning her legitimacy as a trans woman, which is a sensitive issue. The author also didn't consider the possibility that the friend's use of \"trans\" is a crucial part of her self-expression and community belonging.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's question, though perhaps well-intentioned, likely crossed a line by not respecting the friend's chosen identity markers. It's important to affirm the friend's self-identification rather than challenge it based on cis norms. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
