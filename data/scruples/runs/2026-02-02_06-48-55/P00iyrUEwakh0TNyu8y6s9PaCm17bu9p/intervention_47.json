She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The situation is that the friend is transgender, has been happier since transitioning, but still deals with dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author is confused why she insists on using the label \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" and they questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nSo first, I need to consider the context of the friend's identity. For many transgender people, the label \"trans\" is important because it acknowledges their identity and the journey they've been through. Even if they experience ongoing dysphoria or don't feel fully aligned with their gender, the term \"trans\" might be a way to express their identity and the challenges they face. The author, being cisgender, might not fully grasp the significance of the label in the community. \n\nThen there's the action the author took. They directly confronted their friend about it, asking why she needs to specify \"trans.\" This could come off as invalidating because the friend might feel that her self-identification is being questioned. Even if the author's intention was to understand or help, the way it was approached might have been insensitive. \n\nThe friend's reaction shows that this was a sensitive issue for her. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" isn't just a label but a part of her identity that others respect. By suggesting she stop using it, the author could be seen as dismissing her identity, which is a serious issue in many cultures and communities. \n\nI should also think about the concept of \"cis privilege.\" The author, as a cis person, might not face the same challenges in being recognized as their gender, so they might not understand why the term matters. The friend's need to specify \"trans\" could be to assert her identity in a world that might not recognize her as a girl without that label. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's dysphoria means that her experience with her gender is ongoing and complex. The author's question might have unintentionally invalidated that struggle. Even if she's happy overall, the use of the term \"trans\" might be a way for her to navigate that complexity. \n\nSo considering these points, the author's approach was likely hurtful and invalidating. They didn't consider the significance of the label from the friend's perspective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
