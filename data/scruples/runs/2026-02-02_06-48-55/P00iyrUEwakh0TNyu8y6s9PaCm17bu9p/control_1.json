She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning for years, and she's happy but still experiences dysphoria. The author noticed that she often specifies \"trans\" when she introduces herself, like \"I'm a trans girl.\" The author questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is her personal identity and self-identification. Even if she sometimes feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl,\" that doesn't negate her identity. The author, being cis, might not grasp the significance of the label \"trans.\" For many trans people, the label is a part of their identity and helps them navigate their experiences. Insisting on the label could be a way to affirm her identity, especially if she's dealing with dysphoria.\n\nThe author's question, \"Well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to understand, the way the question was phrased could be seen as invalidating. The friend's reaction suggests that the question struck a nerve, possibly making her feel as if her identity was being questioned.\n\nIt's important to recognize that being trans is a fundamental part of someone's identity. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the act of telling someone to stop using a label they choose for themselves is problematic. The author should respect her self-identification without questioning it, especially since the friend is the one who knows her own experiences best.\n\nMoreover, the author's confusion about the importance of labels as a cis person shows a lack of understanding. Labels can serve as important tools for community and identity for trans individuals. The author's comment could be perceived as minimizing the challenges the friend has faced and the significance of her transition.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they questioned their friend's right to self-identify as trans, which can be seen as invalidating and disrespectful. The friend's identity is her own to define, and the author should respect that without imposing their own views, even if they come from a place of confusion.\n"
