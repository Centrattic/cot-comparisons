I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is transgender, assigned male at birth, and has been identifying as a girl for years. She's happy but still deals with dysphoria and sometimes expresses not feeling \"enough like a girl.\" The author noticed that she often includes \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author questioned her about it, leading to a conflict where the friend got upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the importance of identity labels in the transgender community. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp why the label \"trans\" is necessary. The friend might feel that using \"trans\" is a crucial part of her identity, especially given her history of transitioning and dealing with dysphoria. Even if she is happy now, the term \"trans\" could be a way she acknowledges her journey and her gender identity beyond just the current state.\n\nThe author's question, \"If you're a girl, why do you need to specify trans?\" might come off as dismissive of her identity. For many trans people, the label \"trans\" is an essential part of their self-identification. It's not just about the current gender but also about the process and the fact that they were assigned a different gender at birth. The author's suggestion to stop using the term could be perceived as invalidating her experience and the struggles she's faced. Even if the intention wasn't to harm, the impact on the friend was negative, leading to her feeling upset and questioning the author's friendship.\n\nAdditionally, the author might not fully understand the nuances of gender identity. The friend's dysphoria and her statement about not feeling like a girl enough might indicate that she's still navigating her identity, and using the term \"trans\" could be a way to affirm her gender. The author's intervention, while perhaps coming from a place of confusion, crossed a line by challenging her self-identification, which is a sensitive and personal matter.\n\nIn terms of social norms and empathy, it's important to respect how individuals choose to identify themselves. Even if the author is trying to be supportive, questioning someone's chosen labels can be hurtful. The friend's reaction shows that the term \"trans\" holds significant meaning for her, and the author's comment was a breach of that understanding. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because they didn't consider the importance of the label to the friend's identity and well-being.\n"
