She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling their trans friend to stop calling herself trans. The author's friend is a trans girl who's been out for years, but she still experiences dysphoria and mentions not feeling like a girl enough. The author, as a cis person, feels that maybe the label of \"trans\" is causing her issues and suggested she just identify as a girl instead. The friend was upset and defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of gender identity. For many trans people, the term \"trans\" is important because it acknowledges their identity and history. Even if the person is living as their true gender, the term \"trans\" is part of their self-identification. It's not just a label but a way they express their identity. The author, being cis, might not grasp the significance of the label. It's possible that the friend uses \"trans\" to affirm her identity, which is crucial for her mental health and self-acceptance.\n\nThe author's question about why she needs to specify \"trans\" could come off as dismissive or invalidating. Trans individuals often use the term to assert their identity in a society that may not recognize or accept them. Removing the term might make them feel erased or not accepted. The author's comment might be seen as minimizing the challenges the friend has faced, which could contribute to her dysphoria.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong, indicating that the author's words hurt or upset her. Even if the author meant well, suggesting that the label is the problem could be perceived as blaming the friend for her struggles, which is a common trigger in discussions about identity and mental health.\n\nI should also consider that the author's perspective is limited by their own experience as a cis person. They might not realize that the term \"trans\" is a source of validation for trans individuals. The author's intention to reduce confusion or help the friend might be well-meaning, but the method used was inappropriate. It's important to respect how others identify, even if we don't fully understand it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate of the friend's identity and needs. The key issue here is respecting the friend's self-identification. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
