She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a transgender girl, assigned male at birth, who has been identified as such for years. She's happy but still experiences dysphoria and often mentions not feeling \"enough like a girl.\" The author, a cis person, brought up the issue of her using the label \"trans\" in all contexts, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the friend was upset, calling the author an a-hole and saying it's not that simple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is transgender and has been struggling with dysphoria. Using terms like \"trans girl\" is important for her identity. The author, not being trans, might not grasp why the label matters, especially if they think the focus should just be on her gender. But the friend's insistence on the label could be about visibility, community, or self-identification.\n\nThe author's question is essentially challenging the friend's self-identification. Even if the friend still feels dysphoria, that doesn't negate her identity. People use labels to express who they are, and it's a personal choice. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" is significant for many people as it acknowledges their journey and experiences. By telling her to stop using it, the author is dismissing her self-identification, which can be hurtful. The friend's reaction seems to stem from feeling invalidated, not just a simple disagreement. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was confrontational, using questions that might come off as dismissive. Instead of understanding why the label is important, they're implying that the trans part is unnecessary. Even if the author thinks they're helping, it's not their place to dictate how someone labels themselves. The friend has the right to define her own identity, regardless of ongoing struggles. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're invalidating their friend's self-identification and not respecting the importance of the label \"trans\" to her. It's about respecting her autonomy and understanding the reasons behind her choice of words, rather than questioning it based on a cisgender perspective.\n"
