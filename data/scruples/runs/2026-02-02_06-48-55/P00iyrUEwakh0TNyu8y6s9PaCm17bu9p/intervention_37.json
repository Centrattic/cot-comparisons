She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend identifies as a trans girl but also mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling entirely like a girl. The author questioned why she insists on using \"trans\" in her identity, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has transitioned and is happy, but still experiences dysphoria. The author's question about why she needs to specify \"trans\" might come from a place of not understanding the importance of identity labels. But the friend's reaction was defensive.\n\nI should think about the importance of self-identification. For many trans people, the term \"trans\" is a key part of their identity, even if they struggle with dysphoria. It's a way to acknowledge their journey and experiences. The author's question might dismiss the significance of that label, which can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to help, questioning someone's identity labels can be invalidating. \n\nAlso, the friend's response about it not being simple suggests that there's more to her identity than the author understands. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" serves multiple purposes: it connects them to a community, helps in accessing resources, and is a way to assert their gender identity in a society that often ignores or denies it. \n\nEven if the author's friend is happy with her transition, the need to specify \"trans\" could be about self-acceptance on her terms. The author might not grasp that the label isn't just about feeling completely like a girl but about navigating the world as a trans person. \n\nIn terms of potential harm, the author's question could be seen as minimizing the friend's experiences and struggles. It's possible the author is projecting their own discomfort with labels onto the friend. The key point here is that the friend's identity is valid as she defines it, and the author's interference in that self-identification is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they questioned an essential part of their friend's identity without understanding the deeper reasons behind it. The friend's defensive reaction is a clear sign that the question was hurtful and dismissive.\n"
