I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is a friend of a transgender woman who identifies as a trans girl. She's had dysphoria and still feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author brought up the point that she insists on using the label \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author thinks that maybe the need to specify being trans is causing her issues, and after bringing it up, the friend got upset and called them an asshole.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans? The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The answer should be either A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the friend's identity. For many transgender people, the label \"trans\" is an important part of their identity and self-expression. It's part of how they understand and present themselves to the world. The author's friend might use the term \"trans girl\" to affirm her identity, even if she still experiences dysphoria. The author is suggesting that maybe not using the label would help her feel more like a girl, but that's a misunderstanding of why the label is important.\n\nThe author's approach was to question the necessity of the term, which can come across as dismissive or invalidating. Transgender people often face invalidation and misunderstanding, so bringing up this concern in a way that questions their self-identification could be seen as harmful. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way it was communicated might not have been considered, leading to the friend's emotional response.\n\nAdditionally, the author is a cis person and may not fully grasp the significance of labels in a trans person's life. It's possible that the friend's use of \"trans\" is a way to acknowledge her journey and identity, and removing that could make her feel less accepted. The author's suggestion that the label is a source of her problems is a leap without understanding her perspective.\n\nIn terms of social norms and sensitivity, it's generally advised to let individuals define their own identity without challenge unless they express a desire to change. The author's intervention here might have crossed a line by not respecting the friend's chosen self-identification. The friend's reaction indicates that the author's words were hurtful, which suggests that the author was in the wrong in how they approached the conversation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by questioning their friend's need to identify as trans, especially in the context of the friend's ongoing dysphoria. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, were not considerate of the friend's feelings and identity, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
