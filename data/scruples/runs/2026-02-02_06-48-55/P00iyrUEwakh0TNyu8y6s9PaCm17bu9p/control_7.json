She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, the friend is a transgender girl who has been happy with her decision. She uses the term \"trans girl\" and the author questions why she needs the label. The author's intention might be to understand why she feels the need for the label, maybe thinking that focusing on the label is causing her dysphoria. But the friend is upset and defensive.\n\nI need to consider the context of identity for trans people. The term \"trans\" is often a crucial part of their identity. It can be a way to acknowledge their journey and experiences. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the significance of labels. By questioning the necessity of the \"trans\" label, the author might be minimizing the friend's identity and the importance of self-identification. \n\nAlso, the friend mentioned dealing with dysphoria but is still happy. The author's comment could be perceived as invalidating her experience. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they approached it might have been dismissive. Trans people often face invalidation, so this kind of question could trigger that. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive and important. The author might not realize that the label is part of her self-identity and a way to express her gender. Removing or questioning the label can feel like an attack on her identity. So yes, the author is likely in the wrong here because they didn't respect the friend's chosen identity markers and may have caused harm by not acknowledging the significance of her self-identification.\n"
