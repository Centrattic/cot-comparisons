I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is a transgender girl who's been out for years and is happy. But she still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed that the friend always includes \"trans\" when identifying herself, like \"I'm a trans girl.\" The author questioned why she needs the label, thinking maybe it's causing her issues. The friend got upset and defensive, leading the author to ask Reddit if they're a turd.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about identity labels. The author is a cis person (they said \"as a cis person\") trying to understand why the trans friend uses the term \"trans.\" They suggested that maybe she doesn't need the label if she's a girl. But the friend got upset, saying it's not that simple.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of the trans person. For many trans individuals, using the term \"trans\" is a way to acknowledge their identity and the journey they've been through. It's part of their self-identification and can be empowering. Even if someone is happy in their identity, the term \"trans\" might still be important to them as it encompasses their experience. The author's question might come off as dismissive or not understanding the significance of the label. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that maybe the labels are contributing to the friend's dysphoria. But that's a big assumption. Dysphoria is complex and varies for each person. The author might not realize that the label is not the cause but a part of the person's identity. Also, the friend's reaction was strong, indicating that the author's comment was hurtful, even if they had good intentions.\n\nSo, the author's question was probably not malicious, but they didn't consider the importance of identity labels in the trans community. By suggesting that the friend shouldn't use the term \"trans,\" the author is invalidating a part of her identity. Even if the intention was to help, the approach was wrong. The correct answer here would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's self-identification and made an assumption about her dysphoria.\n"
