She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been through gender dysphoria and has been happier since transitioning. The author's issue is that the friend includes \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" and the author thinks maybe the labels are causing her problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and psychological aspects here. For many trans people, identifying as trans is a crucial part of their identity. It's not just a label; it's about their lived experience, their journey, and how they perceive themselves. The author is suggesting that the friend might not \"feel enough like a girl,\" which could be minimizing her experience. Even if she still has dysphoria, that doesn't negate her being a girl or her right to identify as trans. The author's comment about the labels might come off as dismissive or not understanding the importance of self-identification for trans individuals. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong, which makes sense because questioning someone's identity can be hurtful. The author's approach was to challenge her self-identification, which isn't their place. It's important to respect how others identify themselves without imposing one's own views, even if they come from a place of confusion or concern. The author might not realize that for many trans people, being trans is a fundamental part of who they are, regardless of ongoing dysphoria. So, even if the friend is still working through some issues, the author's comment was likely hurtful and misguided. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
