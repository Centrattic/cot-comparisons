She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been transitioning and is happy overall but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed she always includes \"trans\" in her identity and questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the friend might emphasize her identity as trans. For many transgender people, being trans is a core part of their identity, especially if they've gone through transitioning. Even if they're happy with their gender identity, the term \"trans\" can be important for self-identification and community belonging. It might also be a way to acknowledge their journey and the challenges they faced. \n\nThe author's confusion comes from not understanding the significance of labels, as a cis person. But it's possible that the friend uses the term \"trans\" to validate her identity and to connect with others in the trans community. By questioning her need to specify \"trans,\" the author might be invalidating her experience. Even if the friend sometimes feels unsure about her identity, using the label can be empowering. \n\nThe author might not realize that the term \"trans\" isn't just about not feeling enough like a girl but about embracing her identity despite dysphoria. The friend's reaction was defensive because the author's comment could be perceived as challenging her right to self-identify. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was to question her identity in a conversation, which can come off as dismissive. Instead of trying to understand why the friend uses the term, the author made an assumption and confronted her, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author likely overstepped by questioning a core part of their friend's identity without understanding the reasons behind it. The friend's response indicates that the author's comment was hurtful, which suggests the author was in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
