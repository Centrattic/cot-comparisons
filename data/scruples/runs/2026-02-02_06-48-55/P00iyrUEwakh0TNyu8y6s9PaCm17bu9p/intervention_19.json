She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their trans friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been out for years and is happy, but she also deals with dysphoria and doesn't feel entirely like a girl. The author noticed she insists on using \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author questioned this, leading to an argument where the friend felt hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the importance of identity labels. For many trans people, the term \"trans\" is a vital part of their identity, especially when they're navigating their gender and dealing with dysphoria. Even if the author doesn't see the necessity, the friend clearly does. The author's question might come off as dismissive or invalidating. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is significant to her, possibly as a way to acknowledge her journey and the challenges she's faced, even if she doesn't always feel 100% aligned with her gender.\n\nThe author's motivation might be to help their friend feel more at ease with being a girl, but assuming that removing the label would resolve her dysphoria is a big assumption. Dysphoria is complex and not just about labels. The author might not realize that the label is a way for the friend to express her identity and seek validation. By questioning it, the author could be undermining the friend's self-identification, which can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the friend's response (\"it's not that simple\") indicates that the issue is more nuanced than the author might think. The author's approach, while well-intentioned, might not be the right way to address the friend's feelings. It's important to respect someone's chosen labels and understand that these terms can have personal and communal significance. Therefore, the author's action was likely inconsiderate and invalidating, making them at fault here.\n"
