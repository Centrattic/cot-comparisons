She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender woman who's been out for years and is happy, but she mentions she still deals with dysphoria and doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author brings up the issue of the friend using the term \"trans\" repeatedly and questions why she needs to specify it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's actions. The author is a cisgender person who doesn't fully understand the significance of the \"trans\" label. The friend, on the other hand, is transgender and has been identifying as such for years. The author's comment might come off as invalidating the friend's identity, especially since the friend uses the term \"trans\" as part of her self-identification. Even if the author is trying to support their friend, suggesting that she doesn't need to specify \"trans\" could be seen as minimizing her experience and the importance of her chosen identity labels.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. She became defensive and upset, which indicates that the author's comment was hurtful. It's crucial to recognize that for many transgender individuals, the use of labels like \"trans\" is a way to assert their identity and reclaim their narrative, especially in the face of discrimination. The author's lack of understanding about the importance of these labels could lead to unintentional harm.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption that the friend's problems stem from over-identifying as trans might not be valid. The friend's dysphoria is ongoing, and her identity as a trans woman is part of her journey. The author's suggestion could be seen as dismissing the complexities of her identity and the reasons behind her labeling choices.\n\nIn terms of the response from the Reddit community, the general consensus is likely to side with the author being in the wrong because they failed to respect their friend's self-identified labels and may have contributed to her distress. The key point here is respecting someone's identity and understanding that labels are significant to how individuals perceive themselves and how they want to be perceived by others.\n"
