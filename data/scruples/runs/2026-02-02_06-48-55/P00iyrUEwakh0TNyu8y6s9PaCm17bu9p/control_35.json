She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is a transgender girl who's been happy with her transition. However, she still experiences dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author noticed she insists on using \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author then confronted her about this, saying if she's a girl, why specify trans. The friend got upset and said it's not that simple.\n\nSo the core issue here is about the use of labels. The author doesn't see the need for the term \"trans\" here, while the friend clearly does. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI remember that for many trans people, identifying as trans is important because it acknowledges their journey and experience. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, using \"trans\" can be a way to validate their experience and signal their identity to others. The author might not realize that including the term is a personal choice and a key part of their self-identification.\n\nThe author's question implies that maybe the friend's issues stem from not feeling like a girl enough, so the author might think avoiding the term could help. However, it's possible that the friend uses the term \"trans\" as a way to connect with her community and affirm her identity. By asking her to stop using it, the author might be dismissing her self-identity, which can be hurtful and invalidating.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong, indicating that the author crossed a line. Even if the author meant well, the way it was approached (calling her an a-hole, etc.) might have been confrontational. It's important to respect how others identify themselves without questioning their labels, especially when it's part of their identity.\n\nSo considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong. They didn't respect their friend's self-identification and might have invalidating her experience. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
