She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl assigned male at birth, happy with her decision, but has dealt with dysphoria and sometimes feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author, as a cis person, doesn't get why she uses the label \"trans\" every time, like \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl.\" They asked her why she needs to specify, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, and that's her chosen identity. Even if she sometimes struggles with dysphoria, her self-identification is crucial. The author's question comes from a place of confusion, maybe trying to understand the importance of labels. But in doing so, they might have invalidated her identity. \n\nTrans people often use labels to affirm their identity and to navigate a world that doesn't always recognize their gender. The term \"trans\" is an umbrella term for people whose gender is not aligned with their birth-assigned sex. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity now, the term \"trans\" can still be important for them. It might relate to their history and the journey they've taken to get to where they are. \n\nThe author's question, while perhaps well-meaning, could be seen as dismissing the significance of her self-identification. By questioning her need to specify \"trans,\" the author might be undermining her experience and the importance of that label in her self-concept. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong\u2014\"I thought you were my friend\"\u2014which suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact is what matters here. \n\nAdditionally, the author admits they don't understand the importance of labels as a cis person. This is a key point. Allies should recognize that trans individuals might have different reasons for using labels that aren't immediately apparent to cis people. It's about respecting their identity rather than questioning it based on one's own limited perspective. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action of questioning the friend's need to identify as trans was invalidating and not supportive. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
