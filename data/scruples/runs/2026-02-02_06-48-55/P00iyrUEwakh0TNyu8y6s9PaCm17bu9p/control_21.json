She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their trans friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend has gender dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author is confused because their friend uses the label \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl\" and suggested that maybe the label is causing her issues. The friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is cisgender, so they might not grasp the significance of labels for trans individuals. Using labels like \"trans\" is important for many because it affirms their identity and acknowledges their journey. It's not just about the label itself but the self-identification and the community they connect with. \n\nThe author's friend might use \"trans girl\" to assert her identity, especially if she still experiences dysphoria. For some trans people, specifying \"trans\" can be a way to reclaim their identity or to signal to others that she is part of that community. The author's question could be seen as invalidating that choice. Even if the author's intention was to help, suggesting that she shouldn't use the label might make her feel like her identity is being questioned or minimized. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong\u2014calling the author an a-hole and accusing them of not being a friend. That indicates that the comment was hurtful and possibly crossed a boundary. The author might not realize that questioning the use of the label can be perceived as denying her trans identity, which is a very sensitive and personal issue. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author was out of line by telling their friend to stop using a label that the friend proudly identifies with. Even if the author's intention was to alleviate the friend's dysphoria, the approach was flawed. The right thing would have been to support her identity and perhaps ask how they can help her in her journey rather than questioning her labels. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's self-identification and the importance of the label to her identity and community.\n"
