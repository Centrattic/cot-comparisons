She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl (AMAB) who has been transitioned for years and is happy, but has also experienced dysphoria and doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed the friend uses \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author questioned this, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans and uses that label. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the significance of the term. Trans people often use the term \"trans\" to assert their identity, especially in spaces where it's necessary for visibility or to affirm their gender. Even if the friend feels some discomfort with her identity, the term is still important to her. The author's question might come across as invalidating her experience. \n\nThe friend's reaction was strong, which suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. Using \"trans\" in self-identification is a personal choice and can be a source of empowerment. The author's lack of understanding here might be the issue. Just because someone feels some dysphoria doesn't mean the label is incorrect. The author's suggestion that the friend doesn't need to specify might dismiss the importance of her identity. \n\nAlso, the author might be making an assumption that using the term \"trans\" is causing the friend's problems. But the friend's use of the term could be part of her self-acceptance. The author's comment could be seen as minimizing the friend's experience and not respecting her chosen identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms and trans rights, it's generally advised to let trans individuals define their own identity and the labels they use. The author's intervention was direct and possibly abrupt, which might not be the best approach. Even if the author had good intentions, the question was framed in a way that could be perceived as critical. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by questioning the friend's self-identification. The friend's use of \"trans\" is valid regardless of the author's perspective. The author's action was probably inconsiderate of the friend's feelings and the significance of her chosen labels. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
