I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is a transgender girl (assigned male at birth) who's happy with her decision. She mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author is confused about why she specifies \"trans\" every time, like \"trans girl,\" instead of just \"girl.\" The author asked her why she needs to say trans, and the friend got upset.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that maybe the labels are causing her problems. But the friend clearly feels that the label is important. From what I know, identity labels are crucial for many trans people because they help them define their identity and connect with others who share similar experiences. The author might not understand that the term \"trans\" isn't just about being unhappy or needing validation\u2014it's part of how she identifies herself. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was to question her identity in a way that might come off as dismissive. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the act of telling someone their identity is wrong or unnecessary can be harmful. The friend's reaction shows that this was a sensitive issue for her. The author didn't consider that the friend might have her reasons for emphasizing her trans identity, which could include visibility, solidarity with the trans community, or personal affirmation.\n\nSo, even if the author's friend is happy with her transition, the insistence on the trans label might be important for her self-identity. The author's response was to challenge that label, which could be seen as invalidating her identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's choice to identify as trans, despite not fully understanding the reasons behind it.\n"
