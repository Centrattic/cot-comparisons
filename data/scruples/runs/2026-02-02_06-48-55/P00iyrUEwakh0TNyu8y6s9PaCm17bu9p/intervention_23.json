She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been transitioning and is happy overall but still experiences dysphoria. The author noticed the friend always includes \"trans\" when identifying herself, like \"trans girl,\" and questioned why she needs to specify. The friend got upset and the author is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is transgender, so her identity is a core part of who she is. Using labels like \"trans\" is often important for visibility and community. The author, being cisgender, might not grasp the significance of such labels. The author's comment could come off as dismissive or invalidating, even if they didn't mean to be. \n\nThe key point is that the author is questioning the necessity of the label. Even if the author's intention was to show support by focusing on the friend being a girl, suggesting that the trans label is unnecessary can be hurtful. For many trans people, identifying as trans is a way to acknowledge their identity and experiences. Removing that label might make them feel their identity isn't recognized or respected.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl,\" which adds complexity. Her use of the trans label might be a way to affirm her identity despite ongoing dysphoria. The author's comment could undermine her self-acceptance. Even if the author is confused, approaching the topic with empathy and asking questions rather than making statements would be better.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting how others identify is crucial. The author's friend has the right to define her identity, and the author overstepped by questioning her choice. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach was flawed. The correct response would be to support the friend's self-identification without questioning it, unless the friend herself expresses a desire to change it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's identity by questioning her use of the trans label without understanding the context and importance of that label to her.\n"
