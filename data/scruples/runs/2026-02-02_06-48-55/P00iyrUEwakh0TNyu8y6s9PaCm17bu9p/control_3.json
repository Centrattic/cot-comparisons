She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Their friend is a trans girl who's been through transition and is now happier, but still experiences dysphoria and questions her identity. The friend uses labels like \"trans girl\" constantly, and the author is confused about why she needs the trans label if she's a girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of transgender identities. The trans label is often a significant part of someone's identity. It represents their journey and experiences, even if they still have dysphoria. For many trans people, identifying as trans is important for validation and community. The author might not grasp that the label isn't just about fitting into a binary but about self-identification and history.\n\nThe friend's reaction was emotional, which suggests that bringing up the label was a sensitive topic. The author's question might come off as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if the friend is happy, the trans label is part of her self-conception. The author's assumption that the friend doesn't need the trans label because she's a girl now could be seen as minimizing her experience. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that as a cis person, they don't understand the importance of labels. This is a key point. Cis people don't have the same experience with gender labels, so their perspective might not align with trans experiences. The friend's frustration (\"it's not that simple a-hole\") indicates that the author's question wasn't helpful in that context.\n\nIn terms of social norms and respect, it's important to use the labels and terms that people choose for themselves. The author's question could be seen as an attempt to correct or change the friend's self-identification, which is generally not appropriate. People have the right to define their own identity, and questioning that can be hurtful even if not intended.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author likely overstepped by challenging a core part of their friend's identity. The friend's emotional response underscores the sensitivity of the issue. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
