She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is transgender, assigned male at birth, and identifies as a girl. She uses labels like \"trans girl\" and the author is confused about why she needs to include \"trans\" every time. The author thinks that maybe not using the label could help her with her dysphoria. When they brought it up, the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been dealing with dysphoria and has mentioned not feeling like a girl enough. The author's intention was to question the necessity of the label, but the friend took offense.\n\nFrom what I know, labels are significant in the transgender community. Identity isn't just about how someone looks or feels in the moment; it's about how they define themselves. Using \"trans\" can be a way to acknowledge their gender identity and history. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the importance of these labels. Even though the author's question seems innocent, it might come off as invalidating or minimizing the friend's experience. \n\nThe friend's reaction was strong, calling the author an a-hole and feeling betrayed. That suggests that the author's words hurt her. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they approached it was likely dismissive. The key here is understanding that gender identity is deeply personal and the use of labels is a part of that identity. The author's insistence on questioning the label might not take into account the emotional weight behind it.\n\nAlso, the author might not realize that for some trans people, the term \"trans\" is a crucial part of their identity. It's not just a label but a way to connect with a community and express their reality. By suggesting she stop using it, the author could be seen as undermining her identity, which would be hurtful regardless of the intent.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's approach was probably inappropriate. They should have approached the topic with more empathy and understanding, instead of questioning the necessity of the label. The friend's reaction is a valid response to feeling invalidated. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
