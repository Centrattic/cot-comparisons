She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The context is that the friend is a trans girl (assigned male at birth) who has been dealing with dysphoria and sometimes expresses feeling not enough like a girl. The author's reasoning is that maybe specifying \"trans\" is causing her issues, so they asked her why she needs to say it.\n\nFrom what I know, for many transgender people, identifying as trans is an important part of their identity. It signifies their journey and experience of transitioning. Even if someone might feel uncertain or has dysphoria, the term \"trans\" is often a key part of how they see themselves. The author's friend might be using \"trans girl\" to affirm her identity, especially if she's navigating ongoing dysphoria. \n\nThe author's approach here could come across as invalidating. By questioning her label, they might be undermining her self-identification. Trans individuals often choose labels that best represent their experience, and suggesting they shouldn't use a label they've chosen can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to explore why she feels that way, the way it was approached might have been seen as dismissive or not respecting her identity.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction\u2014getting upset and feeling betrayed\u2014suggests that the author's question hit a sensitive point. The author might not fully grasp the significance of the term \"trans\" in her self-concept. It's possible that for her, being trans is a crucial part of her identity, and the author's comment might have felt like they were minimizing her experiences or invalidating her choices.\n\nSo, based on this, the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's self-identified labels and may have contributed to her feeling disrespected. The correct answer would be A.\n"
