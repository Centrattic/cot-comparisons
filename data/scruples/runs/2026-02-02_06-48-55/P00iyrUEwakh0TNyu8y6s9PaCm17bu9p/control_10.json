She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been transitioning for years and is happy, but she still experiences dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author of the post is confused because the friend keeps emphasizing her identity as a trans girl rather than just a girl, and they questioned why that's necessary. The friend was upset by this, leading the author to seek opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of transgender identities. For many trans people, identifying as trans is an important part of their identity. It encompasses their journey, experiences, and how they see themselves. The author's friend might use the term \"trans\" to acknowledge her transition and the ongoing aspects of her identity, even if she feels some dysphoria. The author's question might come off as invalidating because he's suggesting that her identity is too complicated or that she shouldn't need the label. Even if the author's intention was to understand, the way he framed the question could be seen as dismissing her experience.\n\nDysphoria is a significant part of the trans experience for many. The fact that the friend mentions she doesn't feel like a girl enough might mean that the term \"trans\" is a way for her to express that she is a girl but also acknowledges the journey she's on. The author's comment about labels might not understand the importance of self-identification for the trans community. Cis people (non-trans) often don't think about their gender labels in the same way, so this could lead to a misunderstanding.\n\nThe friend's reaction was emotional, indicating that the author's question hurt her or made her feel misunderstood. Even if the author didn't intend to be harmful, asking someone to not use a label they identify with can be seen as invalidating. The key here is whether the author's question was respectful and open to understanding. If he approached it as a genuine question without judgment, maybe it's less about being wrong, but given the friend's response, the author might not have considered how his words could come across as dismissive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to respect how people identify themselves. Telling someone they shouldn't use a label they choose for themselves is usually considered incorrect. The author's confusion about the importance of labels might stem from a cis perspective, but the trans community's use of such labels is valid and important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his friend's self-identification, even if his intention was to help or understand better.\n"
