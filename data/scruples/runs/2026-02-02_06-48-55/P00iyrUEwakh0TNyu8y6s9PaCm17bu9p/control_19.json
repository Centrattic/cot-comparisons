She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who is a trans girl, assigned male at birth. The author of the post is questioning why she insists on identifying as trans when she doesn't feel like a girl enough and has dealt with dysphoria. The friend got upset when the author suggested not using the \"trans\" label.\n\nFirst, I need to consider transgender identity and the role of labels. For many trans people, identity is about self-identification, and using terms like \"trans\" is important for their sense of self. Even if someone experiences dysphoria or doesn't feel they fit 100%, that doesn't negate their identity. The author is a cis person, so their perspective might lack understanding of the trans experience.\n\nThe author's friend is using \"trans\" in her identity, which is a valid choice. The author is questioning that choice, which can come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to be supportive, the way they approached it might have been abrupt. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is important to her, and the author's questioning it without understanding could be seen as harmful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has dealt with dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. Even if someone has ongoing dysphoria, that doesn't mean their identity is wrong. Trans people can still identify as their gender even if they experience dysphoria. The author's suggestion that maybe the label is the source of the problem could be undermining the friend's self-identity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to respect how others identify themselves. Correcting or questioning someone's chosen labels can be considered disrespectful. The author is in a position to listen and support, rather than offer unsolicited advice about identity.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by questioning their friend's use of the \"trans\" label without understanding the significance it holds for her. The friend's upset reaction is valid because the author was challenging a core part of her identity. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
