She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who has been happy with her transition, but she still experiences dysphoria and mentions not feeling enough like a girl. The author noticed that the friend often includes \"trans\" in her statements, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author asked why she needs to specify. The friend got upset, saying it's not that simple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author, who is cisgender, is questioning the necessity of the label \"trans\" for their friend. They think maybe the friend's identification as trans is causing her issues. The friend is upset, though, which suggests that the label is significant to her identity.\n\nI remember that for many transgender individuals, using the label \"trans\" is an important part of their identity and self-expression. It signifies their journey and experience. Even if the author doesn't see the need for the label, it's possible that the friend uses it as a way to affirm her identity and navigate the world. The author's comment might have come across as dismissive of the friend's identity, which can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author is projecting their own cisgender perspective onto the friend's experience. They might not understand the importance of labels because, as a cis person, they don't need to specify their gender in the same way. But for trans people, the label can be a crucial aspect of how they see themselves and how they are perceived by others.\n\nAdditionally, the author's suggestion that the friend's problems might stem from being labeled as trans is problematic. It could imply that the friend's identity is the source of her dysphoria or issues, which isn't the case. Dysphoria is a medical condition related to gender identity, not the label itself. The author's comment might have invalidated the friend's feelings and experiences.\n\nThe friend's reaction was strong, indicating that the author's words were hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to be supportive, the way they approached the conversation wasn't respectful of the friend's autonomy and identity. The author should have been more cautious and empathetic, perhaps seeking to understand rather than questioning the necessity of the label.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author likely did overstep by challenging the friend's choice to identify as trans. The friend has the right to self-identify, and the author's cis perspective doesn't give them the authority to question that identity. The author should apologize and respect the friend's decision to use the label, even if they don't see the need for it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
