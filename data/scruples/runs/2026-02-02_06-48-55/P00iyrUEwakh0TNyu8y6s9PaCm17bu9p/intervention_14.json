She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is a transgender woman who's been out for years and is happy. But she still experiences dysphoria and sometimes says she doesn't feel \"enough like a girl.\" The author, a cis person, is confused why she insists on labeling herself as trans in every statement. The author asked her why she needs to specify \"trans\" if she's a girl, leading to an argument.\n\nHmm. The key here is understanding the significance of labels for transgender individuals. For many, using \"trans\" is part of their identity. It's not just a label but a way to affirm their gender and experiences. The author is suggesting that maybe the label is contributing to her issues, which could be dismissive of her identity.\n\nThe friend got upset, calling the author an a-hole. The author didn't realize that their question could come off as invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach was likely inappropriate. Trans people often use the term \"trans\" to be transparent about their gender history, especially in contexts where others might not know. It's a choice that's part of their self-identification.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the importance of the label to their friend's identity. The friend's reaction shows that the author's comment was hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to be, the question undermined the friend's self-identification. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
