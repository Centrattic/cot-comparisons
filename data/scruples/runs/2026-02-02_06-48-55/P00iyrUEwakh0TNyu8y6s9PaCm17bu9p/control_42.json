She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been happy with her transition but still experiences dysphoria. She often mentions not feeling enough like a girl, and the author brings up the issue of her using the term \"trans\" in every statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the conflict. The author is confused because they think if the friend is a girl, why specify \"trans.\" The friend is upset and feels the author is invalidating her identity. \n\nSo, the key points here are the importance of labels in identity. For many trans people, identifying as trans is a crucial part of their self-identity. It's not just a label but a way to express their lived experience. The author might be coming from a place of not understanding the significance of the term \"trans\" in their friend's life. \n\nThe friend's mention of dysphoria suggests that she may struggle with her gender identity, which could explain why the term \"trans\" is important to her. It might help her feel that her identity is acknowledged, especially if she's still navigating her feelings about being a girl. \n\nThe author's comment could be seen as dismissive. Even if they meant well, questioning why she needs the label might make her feel like her identity isn't accepted. The friend's reaction is strong, indicating that the author crossed a line, even if unintentionally. \n\nIt's also worth considering that cis people (like the author) might not fully grasp the complexities of trans identity. The author's perspective is limited by their own experience, but that doesn't justify making assumptions or challenging someone else's self-identification. \n\nIn terms of societal context, respecting someone's chosen labels is a basic part of supporting their identity. The author's intervention in this case likely made the friend feel invalidated, which is why the friend was upset. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they challenged their friend's identity in a way that caused harm, even if they didn't mean to. The answer should be A.\n"
