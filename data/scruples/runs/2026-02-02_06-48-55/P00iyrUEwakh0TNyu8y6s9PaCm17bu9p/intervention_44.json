She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's happy with her decision but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author, a cis person, brought up the issue of why she needs to specify \"trans\" every time, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the friend's identity. For many trans people, the label \"trans\" is significant because it acknowledges their transition and the challenges they've faced. It's a way of affirming their identity. Even if the friend sometimes feels uncertain, the term might be important for her self-identification and how she wants others to perceive her.\n\nThe author's intention might have been to question the necessity of the label, thinking it's complicating her self-perception. However, from the author's own description, the friend has a history of dysphoria and relies on the trans label. The author might not fully grasp the importance of labels in the trans community, where terms like \"trans\" can be a source of solidarity and pride, despite internal struggles.\n\nAlso, the author is cis, which means they may lack the lived experience to understand the nuances. It's possible that by questioning the label, the author inadvertently invalidated the friend's identity. Even if the friend is happy overall, the act of specifying \"trans\" could be a way she asserts her identity, especially when dealing with dysphoria. The friend's reaction suggests that the label is important to her, and the author's comment might have been perceived as dismissive of her experience.\n\nAnother angle is the author's approach. Bringing up the issue in a direct manner, perhaps without fully understanding the emotional weight, could have been unconsidered. The friend's response was defensive, which indicates that the topic is sensitive and might require a more empathetic approach.\n\nIn summary, the author's question might stem from a place of concern, but the way it was approached likely overlooked the significance of the term \"trans\" in the friend's identity. Even if the author's intention wasn't to harm, the result was causing distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's chosen identity markers and failed to recognize the importance of such labels in her self-perception.\n"
