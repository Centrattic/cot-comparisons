She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's happy but mentions dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author noticed that the friend always includes \"trans\" in her identity and questioned why she needs that label. The friend got upset and accused the author of not supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is trans and has a history of dysphoria. Using \"trans\" is part of her identity. The author, being cis, might not grasp the importance of labels. But even so, questioning someone's self-identification can be harmful. The author's friend might see the label as important for her identity, especially if she's dealing with dysphoria. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if the author's intention was to support, the impact was negative. So, the author is likely in the wrong here because they didn't respect their friend's self-identified labels, which are important for her sense of self. The answer is A.\n"
