She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been transitioning for years and is happy, but she mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author brought up the point about her using \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is an important part of her identity. The author is a cis person, so they might not fully grasp the significance of labels like \"trans.\" The friend's insistence on using \"trans\" might be about self-identification and community belonging. \n\nThe author's question is based on a misunderstanding. Trans people often use the term \"trans\" to describe their identity, even if they are happy with their transition. It's not just about being a girl; it's about the journey and the gender identity. The author's comment could come off as invalidating because they're suggesting that if she's a girl, she shouldn't need the label. \n\nThe friend's reaction was strong, which makes sense because the author's question might have touched on her insecurities or past struggles with dysphoria. Even if the author had good intentions, bringing up this topic without understanding the depth of her experience could be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't realize that the term \"trans\" is an essential part of her identity. The friend's identity is valid regardless of how she feels about her gender, and the author's question might have undermined that. So, the author is likely in the wrong here for not respecting her self-identification and for not considering her feelings in the way they approached the topic.\n"
