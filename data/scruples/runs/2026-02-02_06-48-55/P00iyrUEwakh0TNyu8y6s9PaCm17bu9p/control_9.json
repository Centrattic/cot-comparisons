She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a transgender woman who has been through transition and is happy, but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't fully identify as a woman. The author noticed that she includes \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and questioned her about it. The friend was upset and the author is confused about their role.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of gender identity and terminology. For many trans people, identifying as trans is an important part of their identity. Even if they feel they don't \"feel enough like a girl,\" being trans is part of their self-identification. The author's friend might use \"trans girl\" to acknowledge her gender identity and history, which is valid. \n\nThe author's question implies that being trans isn't necessary if she's a girl now. But for trans individuals, the label \"trans\" is often about their lived experience and self-identification, not just about being a girl. It's possible that the author is not recognizing the significance of her friend's identity. \n\nAlso, the friend mentioned dealing with dysphoria. That could mean she's still navigating her identity, and the use of \"trans\" might be a way to express that process. The author's comment could come off as invalidating her experience. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to respect how people identify themselves. Questioning someone's label, especially in a way that suggests they shouldn't use it, can be seen as dismissive. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the method could have been better. They should have listened more and offered support rather than challenging her self-identification.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action likely made their friend feel invalidated. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's self-identification and possibly added to her dysphoria by questioning her identity.\n"
