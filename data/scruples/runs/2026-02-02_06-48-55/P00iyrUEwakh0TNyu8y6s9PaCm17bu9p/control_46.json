She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they told their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is transgender, has been happy since transitioning, but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed that the friend always includes \"trans\" in her identity statements, like \"trans girl,\" and the author questioned why she needs to specify that. The friend got really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend is transgender, which is a core part of her identity. For many trans people, identifying as trans is important because it acknowledges their lived experience and the journey they've been through. Even if they're happy now, the label might still be significant to them. The author, as a cis person, might not fully grasp why the label is necessary. They think maybe the friend's insistence on being called trans is causing her problems, but that's a big assumption.\n\nThe author approached the friend about this, and the friend was defensive. That suggests that the author's comment may have invalidated the friend's identity. The friend's response of \"it's not that simple\" indicates that the author's question didn't consider the complexity of her identity. By asking why she needs to specify trans, the author might have come across as minimizing her experience. The friend's dysphoria is a personal struggle, and the author's comment could be seen as dismissive of that.\n\nAlso, the author's intention might have been to help, but the way they approached it was probably harmful. Instead of questioning the friend's self-identification, they should have listened more and offered support. The friend felt that the author didn't understand, which is a common issue when cis people make assumptions about trans people's experiences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was to challenge the friend's self-identification, which is a sensitive issue. The friend's identity is her own, and the author doesn't get to decide how she should label herself. Even if the author's intention was to alleviate the friend's dysphoria, the method was inappropriate. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
