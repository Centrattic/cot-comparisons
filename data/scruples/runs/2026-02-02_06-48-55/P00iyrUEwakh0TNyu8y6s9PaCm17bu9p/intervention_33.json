She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"I'm a trans girl\" situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's friend identifies as a trans girl and has been living as such for years. The friend has mentioned dealing with dysphoria but is happy overall. The issue here is that the author is questioning why she still identifies as trans, suggesting that if she's a girl, she doesn't need the label. The friend got upset and defensive, leading the author to ask Reddit if they're a turd.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that maybe the labels aren't important as a cis person might not understand. But trans people often use the label \"trans\" to describe their identity, not just their gender. It's part of their self-identification and can be important for community, validation, and understanding their own experiences. Even if someone is happy with their current gender identity, the term \"trans\" acknowledges their journey and history of transition. \n\nBy questioning the necessity of the label, the author might be minimizing the friend's experience. It could come off as invalidating, even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive. The friend's reaction shows that the label is significant to her, and the author's question might have unintentionally dismissed her identity. \n\nAlso, the author might not realize that for many trans individuals, the label is a source of pride and a way to connect with others who share similar experiences. Even if someone no longer identifies as trans later on, that's a personal choice, but the author's approach here seems to be questioning the need for the label without understanding its importance to the friend. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author's question was likely hurtful and inconsiderate. They made an assumption about the importance of labels without considering the friend's perspective. The answer here would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
