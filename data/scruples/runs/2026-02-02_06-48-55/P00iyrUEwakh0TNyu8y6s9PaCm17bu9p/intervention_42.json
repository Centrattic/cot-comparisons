I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl assigned male at birth, and she's been dealing with dysphoria. The author noticed she often includes \"trans\" when describing herself, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and questioned why she feels the need to specify. The friend got upset, and the author is confused about whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend identifies as transgender, which is a significant part of her identity. The author is cisgender, so maybe they don't fully grasp the significance of labels. The friend uses \"trans\" as part of her self-identification, which might be important for her to acknowledge her gender journey and experiences. \n\nThe author's question implies that if she's a girl now, why specify trans. But for many trans people, being trans is an essential part of their identity. It's not just about the label but about the lived experience, the history of transitioning, and the community they connect with. The author's friend might feel that specifying \"trans\" affirms her identity and connects her to others who share similar experiences. \n\nThe author's comment could come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they brought it up might have been triggering or disrespectful. The friend's reaction of being upset makes sense because having her identity questioned can be hurtful. \n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting how others identify themselves is crucial. The author's friend has the right to self-identify, and the author shouldn't impose their views on how she should describe herself. Even if the author thinks the label isn't necessary, it's about the individual's comfort and identity. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author not fully understanding the importance of labels as a cis person. That's a common point; cis people might not grasp the significance that labels hold for trans individuals. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's question was likely inconsiderate and crossed a line by challenging an essential part of their friend's identity. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's self-identification and didn't respect her right to use the label that matters to her.\n"
