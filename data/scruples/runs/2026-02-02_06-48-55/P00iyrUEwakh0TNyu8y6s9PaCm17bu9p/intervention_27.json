She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is questioning their friend's use of the term \"trans\" when she refers to herself. The friend is a transgender girl assigned male at birth, and she's been happy with her transition. But the author notices that she often mentions \"trans\" in her self-identification, like \"trans girl,\" and is confused about why she feels the need to specify that.\n\nThe author brings up this confusion, and the friend gets upset, leading to the author seeking advice. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of gender identity and the significance of labels in the transgender community. From what I know, for many transgender people, identifying as \"trans\" is important. It acknowledges their journey and the challenges they've faced. Even if someone is happy with their transition, the term \"trans\" is often part of their identity and a way to connect with the broader community. \n\nThe author is suggesting that since the friend is a girl now, she shouldn't need to specify \"trans.\" But maybe that's not the case. The friend might identify as a trans girl because her identity includes both her current gender and her history. The term \"trans\" is part of her self-conception, not just about her past. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has dealt with dysphoria and sometimes feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author might be projecting their own cisgender perspective, thinking that if she's a girl now, the trans label isn't necessary. However, the friend's experience is different. Her identity as trans is valid regardless of how she feels about her current gender. \n\nBy questioning her use of the term, the author could be invalidating her identity. The friend's reaction was defensive, which suggests that this issue is sensitive and personal. The author might not realize that their question, while coming from a place of confusion, could be perceived as dismissive or not taking her identity seriously. \n\nIn many cases, asking a transgender person why they need to specify their gender identity can be hurtful. It's important to respect how they define themselves. The author's approach was to question her self-identification, which is not appropriate. The right approach would be to ask for her perspective without judgment, but even then, the friend might have personal reasons for using the term that others might not understand. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's self-identification by questioning her use of the term \"trans.\" The answer should be A.\n"
