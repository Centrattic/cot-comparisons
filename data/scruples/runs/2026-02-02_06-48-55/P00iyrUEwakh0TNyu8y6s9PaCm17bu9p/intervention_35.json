She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been happier since her transition but still experiences dysphoria. The author noticed that she often includes \"trans\" in her identity statements and felt confused about it. They confronted her, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as a trans girl, which is part of her identity. The author is cisgender and might not fully grasp the significance of the term \"trans.\" Maybe for her, being trans is a key part of her identity, even if she's happy now. The term could be important for self-identification, community belonging, or acknowledging her journey. \n\nThe author's question might come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to question the necessity of the label, the way it was brought up could have been hurtful. The friend's reaction suggests that the term holds personal significance beyond just being a label. \n\nAdditionally, trans people often use the term \"trans\" to affirm their identity, especially if they're in a community where that term is common. The author, as a cis person, might not understand the nuances here. It's possible that the author's question minimized the friend's feelings or the complexities of her experience. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend mentioned dysphoria and the author brought up the label in that context could imply that the author was trying to help, but in a way that wasn't supportive. It's crucial to validate someone's identity without trying to question or simplify it, especially when they're already dealing with internal struggles.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might have been inconsiderate. The friend's identity as trans is part of who she is, and the author's question could have been perceived as invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach was flawed. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
