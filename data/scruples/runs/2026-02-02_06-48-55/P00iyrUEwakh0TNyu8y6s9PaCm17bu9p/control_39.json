She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is a trans girl who identifies as transgender. She's been happy with her transition but mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling \"enough like a girl.\" The author noticed that the friend includes \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl.\" The author questioned this, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main issue is about the use of labels and the importance of the term \"trans\" in the friend's identity. The author doesn't see the necessity of the label and suggested that if she's a girl, she shouldn't need to specify \"trans.\" The friend took offense and felt disrespected.\n\nI know that for many in the trans community, using the term \"trans\" is important for self-identification and acknowledging their lived experience. Even if someone feels more comfortable in their gender role now, the term might still hold significance for their history and identity. The author's question might come off as dismissive or minimizing the friend's journey. \n\nThe author might not realize that the label isn't just about current feelings but about the entire experience of transitioning and being part of the trans community. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is meaningful to her, perhaps as a way to assert her identity despite ongoing dysphoria. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention might have been to be supportive, but the way they approached it was probably insensitive. The friend likely felt that her identity was being questioned or invalidated. Even if the author had good intentions, the question could be seen as undermining the friend's self-identification. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they failed to respect their friend's chosen identity terms and might have invalidated her experience.\n"
