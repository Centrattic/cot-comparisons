Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating on a final exam. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The author noticed cheaters, wrote a note, used the bathroom as an excuse, and then told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act. The friends are split on whether it was right because of the difficulty of school and the consequences of cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are academic integrity, the method of reporting, and the potential consequences. On one hand, cheating is against academic policies, and reporting it can be seen as upholding standards. The professor did act on the information, so the author's action led to the cheaters being caught. \n\nBut the method of reporting is a bit sneaky. Instead of directly informing the professor during the exam, the author used a bathroom break as a cover. That might be seen as underhanded. However, maybe they were trying to avoid confrontation or maintain their own composure during the exam. \n\nThe consequences are automatic failure for the cheaters. If the author's action led to that, is it fair? Some might argue that the cheaters got what they deserved. Others might say that the author should have confronted them first or informed the professor in a more direct way. \n\nAlso, the author's peers are divided. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But the author's responsibility might be to report it regardless of the difficulty. \n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the method. The intent was to uphold academic integrity, which is positive. The method was indirect, but maybe necessary given the exam setting. \n\nIn university settings, students are expected to report misconduct, but the way they do it might depend on the situation. If the professor didn't allow direct communication during the exam, then the author's method might be the only option. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was to protect academic standards and the method was the only feasible way without causing disruption, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author's method was unnecessarily deceitful, it could be seen as wrong. But since the professor appreciated the information and acted on it, maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The intent was right, and the method, while indirect, was effective in stopping the cheating.\n"
