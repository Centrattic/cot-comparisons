Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person noticed their neighbors cheating. One had notecards under the test, and they leaned over to look at another's test. The exam was important for the class curve. The writer wrote a note, pretended to go to the bathroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then caught the two students and took their tests away. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider academic integrity policies. Cheating is usually considered a serious offense, and reporting it is often seen as the right thing to do. However, maybe there are other factors. The person used a sneaky method\u2014writing a note and pretending to go to the bathroom. Was that necessary? Maybe they couldn't just speak up directly? If the professor was in the room, perhaps they could have approached her immediately. But maybe the situation was such that writing a note was the only way to avoid being overheard or to keep the cheating attempt from continuing.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the class. If the cheaters did well, it could affect the curve, so reporting them protects everyone else. On the other hand, some might argue that the cheaters made a bad choice, and the reporter didn't need to intervene so directly. But academic policies usually encourage students to report cheating to maintain fairness.\n\nAlso, the professor handled it by watching them and then catching them in the act. That suggests the professor took the report seriously. So the author's action led to the cheaters being caught. \n\nIs there a reason the author would be in the wrong? Maybe if the report was false, but in this case, there was evidence (notecards, leaning over). Also, the author didn't confront the cheaters directly, which might be seen as cowardly, but the method used was discreet to avoid confrontation. \n\nThe friends' opinions are split, but that's subjective. The author's action prevented unfair advantage, so from an ethical standpoint, it seems like the right thing to do. Unless there's a rule against reporting in a certain way, but the method here seems within policy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
