Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for reporting two people who were cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP noticed a classmate had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another person's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and handed over the note. The professor then caught the cheaters in the act and confiscated their tests. The friends are divided on whether the OP did the right thing. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh to ruin their grades. The OP is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity policies. Reporting cheating is usually encouraged to maintain fairness. The professor probably has a responsibility to enforce rules, and the OP's action led to the professor catching the cheaters. From that angle, the OP did the right thing by upholding academic standards.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the OP could have handled it differently. Maybe confronting the cheaters directly or giving them a chance to stop, but in an exam setting, the immediate option is often to report. However, in most academic settings, students are expected to report cheating when they see it. The OP didn't confront them directly but instead informed the professor, which is the standard procedure. \n\nAnother point is the impact on the cheaters. Cheating leads to automatic failure, which is a severe consequence. Some might think the OP is being too harsh by causing others to fail, but if the cheaters were indeed violating the rules, then the consequences are part of the system. The other students might be affected by the curve if the cheaters did well, so reporting could be in everyone's interest.\n\nThe OP's method was discreet, using a note and going to the bathroom to avoid confrontation. This approach is practical in an exam setting where direct intervention isn't possible. The professor handled the situation, so the OP just provided necessary information.\n\nConsidering all this, the ethical stance would likely support the OP. Academic integrity is a shared responsibility, and reporting cheating is a right and duty of students. The consequences are up to the institution's policies, not the reporter. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
