Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam where the person noticed two others cheating and reported them to the professor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Most institutions have academic integrity policies that prohibit cheating and require students to report violations. The professor confirmed the cheating and took action, leading to the students failing. \n\nThe person who reported didn't confront them directly but discreetly informed the professor. They had a reason to do so because cheating affects everyone, especially the curve. Their friends are divided, but the main question is whether ratting them out was right or wrong.\n\nCheating is against academic rules, so reporting is often encouraged. The reporter followed the proper channel by informing the professor. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters. But the policy states automatic failure, so the reporter isn't causing the failure; the cheaters did. \n\nI think the key points are academic integrity policies and following procedures. The author acted within the rules, so they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
