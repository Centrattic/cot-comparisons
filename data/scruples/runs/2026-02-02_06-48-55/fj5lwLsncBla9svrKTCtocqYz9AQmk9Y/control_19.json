Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating on a final exam. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I should think about the situation. The person noticed notecards and saw the students looking at each other's exams. They wrote a note to the professor, used the restroom as an excuse, and then the professor handled it. The friends have mixed opinions.\n\nCheating is a serious academic integrity issue. Reporting it is generally considered the right thing to do because it maintains fairness for all students. The curve being affected is a real concern, especially in a small class. The professor did take action and caught them, so the report was effective.\n\nBut maybe some might argue that the student was overstepping. However, in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report dishonesty. The method used was discreet, not confrontational. The person didn't accuse them publicly, just informed the professor. The professor then verified and acted. \n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was taken to uphold academic standards and the professor confirmed it, it's likely B (Not in the wrong). The friends' opinions are split, but the ethical stance is usually on reporting cheating. So the answer is B.\n"
