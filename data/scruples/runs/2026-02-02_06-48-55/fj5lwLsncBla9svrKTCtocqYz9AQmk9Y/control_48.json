Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the individual noticed two people cheating. One had notecards under the test, and the other was peeking over someone else's shoulder. The author took a note to the professor, using a restroom break as a cover, and the professor then caught the cheaters.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The friends are split, with some saying it's right because cheating is wrong, others saying it's wrong because school is hard. The class has a policy where cheating leads to automatic failure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity. Reporting it could be seen as upholding standards, which is a positive action. However, some might argue that reporting peers can create a hostile environment or that the cheaters might have been under stress, leading to their unethical choice.\n\nThen, the legal and institutional policies: if the university's code of conduct requires reporting cheating, then the author acted appropriately. The professor confirmed the action by taking over the situation, which suggests that the university's procedures were followed. So, from an institutional standpoint, the author followed the right protocol.\n\nOn the flip side, there's the social aspect. Some might feel that it's a betrayal of peers, but others might see it as a duty to maintain fairness. The author didn't confront them directly but used a discreet method, which could be seen as respectful, not causing a scene during the exam.\n\nThe consequences for the cheaters are severe (automatic failure), which is part of the class policy. The author's action led to them failing, which might be seen as harsh, but it's the set rule. So, the author might not be responsible for the outcome beyond following the rules.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the action aligns with institutional policies and upholds academic integrity. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
