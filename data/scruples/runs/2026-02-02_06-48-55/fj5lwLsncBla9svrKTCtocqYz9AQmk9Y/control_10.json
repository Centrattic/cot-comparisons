Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two students cheating. One had notecards under their test, and they leaned over to peek at another's paper. The person wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, who then caught them. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others and undermines academic integrity. Reporting it could be seen as upholding standards, but some might argue that it's harsh or that students are under pressure.\n\nUniversity policies usually have rules about cheating. If the professor is supposed to enforce these, then the student doing the reporting might be helping maintain fairness. However, there's also the question of whether the person acted appropriately. They used a discreet method (note and bathroom break) which might be seen as responsible, as opposed to publicly shaming them.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the person was being a \"snitch\" or that they should focus on their own work instead of others'. But in academic settings, reporting cheating is often encouraged to prevent unfair advantages.\n\nThe consequences for the cheaters are severe (automatic failure), which could be seen as a necessary outcome. The person reporting might feel justified in protecting the integrity of the exam and the class grade curve.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: upholding academic integrity vs. the personal cost to the cheaters. Since the action was done discreetly and led to the professor addressing the issue, it seems like the right thing to do. Therefore, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
