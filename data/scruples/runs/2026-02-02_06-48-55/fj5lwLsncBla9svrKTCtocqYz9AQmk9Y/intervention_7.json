Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the person noticed two students cheating during a final exam. They had notecards under their test and leaned over to see another's test. The author then wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor, which led to the professor catching them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense. If the institution has clear policies against cheating, then the author might be acting within the rules by reporting. However, some might argue that the person should have handled it differently, like informing the professor directly without a note. But the professor did catch them, so maybe the method worked.\n\nThen there's the social dynamics. Friends are split: some think the author did the right thing because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh because school is tough. The author's action led to the students failing, which is a severe consequence. Could there be a middle ground? Maybe the professor could have given a warning, but the policy says automatic failure, so the author might not be responsible for that outcome.\n\nThe author's method involved a bit of deception (using a bathroom break as an excuse) and stealth. But in an exam setting, where students aren't allowed to leave without permission, the professor would probably understand the need to discreetly report cheating without alerting the cheaters. The key is whether the author acted in good faith to uphold academic integrity versus seeking revenge or personal gain.\n\nAlso, the author's own exam was submitted to the professor for safekeeping, showing they were cooperative. The professor took charge afterward, so the author didn't interfere beyond reporting. It seems like the action was taken to prevent unfair advantage, which is generally seen as the right thing to do in academic settings.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, unless there's a rule against reporting cheating in a certain way, the author's actions seem justified. The ethical duty to report cheating might outweigh the method used if the intent was genuine. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
