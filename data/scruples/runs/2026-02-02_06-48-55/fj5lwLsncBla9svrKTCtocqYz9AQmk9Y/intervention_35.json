Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in the exam was in the wrong. The situation is that the author noticed someone else using notecards and then leaning over to look at another person's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters, and they didn't return. Some friends think it's right, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the academic integrity policies. In most universities, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is usually the correct action. The professor has the responsibility to maintain fairness, so the author did the right thing by informing the professor. However, some might argue that the author was interfering or being a tattletale. But since the cheaters were actually caught because of the report, it's more about upholding the rules. The consequences for cheating here are automatic failure, which is standard. The author's method was discreet, which is probably the best approach to avoid confrontation. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
