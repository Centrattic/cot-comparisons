Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. The situation is in a university setting. So, first, I need to consider the ethical implications here.\n\nThe person noticed the notecards and saw the students collaborating. They wrote a note and discreetly told the professor. Then the professor dealt with it and caught them in the act. The friends have mixed opinions. Some think it's right because cheating is bad, others say school is hard so maybe they shouldn't have been cheated on.\n\nI need to determine if the author did something wrong. Legally and academically, most universities have policies against cheating and encourage reporting. So from that standpoint, the author followed the proper channel by informing the professor. They did it discreetly without causing a scene, which might be considered respectful.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's interfering with others' academic freedom or that the author was being a snitch. But the key points are that the professor confirmed the cheating and took action. The author didn't take matters into their own hands beyond reporting. The professor's actions were the ones that led to the students being caught. \n\nCheating is a serious offense, and the class policy says it results in automatic failure. So the author's action prevented unfair advantage, which is in line with academic integrity. The friends' split opinions reflect common debates but don't necessarily indicate wrongdoing by the reporter.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
