Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university setting. So, the person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's exams. They then informed the professor discreetly, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Cheating is a serious offense, and the professor likely has a policy against it. By reporting the cheating, the person is upholding academic integrity. But some might argue that it's a harsh outcome, causing the cheaters to fail. On the other hand, cheating undermines the educational system and is against the rules. The person didn't confront them directly but discreetly informed the professor, which is a responsible action. Friends have mixed opinions, but the main point is whether the person acted wrongly. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, reporting cheating is usually seen as the right thing to do. It prevents unfair advantages and maintains fairness for other students. The professor handled the situation, so the person followed the correct procedure. The cheaters got what they deserved according to the rules. So, the answer is probably B, the person is not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance if the person had a personal vendetta or did it in a vindictive way. However, the description doesn't suggest that. The person noticed the cheating and acted appropriately.\n"
