Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported two classmates for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam. The key points are:\n\n1. The author noticed notecards and saw someone leaning to see another's test.\n2. The author wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse to give it to the professor.\n3. The professor acted, caught the cheaters, and they didn't return.\n4. Friends are split on whether it's right or wrong.\n\nFirst, ethical considerations. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity. Reporting it is generally expected to maintain fairness. However, some might argue that the author was overstepping or that the cheaters deserved a chance. Others might see it as doing the right thing to uphold standards.\n\nLegal and institutional policies: Universities usually have strict policies against cheating. Reporting is a responsibility of students. The professor handled it, so the author followed proper channels. No direct confrontation, just informing the professor, which is appropriate.\n\nPotential downsides: Could there be personal vendettas? The scenario doesn't suggest that. The author acted in real-time, which is necessary for immediate cheating. The professor confirmed the action, so the author's report was effective.\n\nSocial dynamics: Friends' mixed reactions are common. Some might feel it's betrayal, others see it as necessary. The author's method was discreet, which is better than public confrontation.\n\nAcademic consequences: The cheaters failed, which is the policy. The author's action ensured the class wasn't curved unfairly. Protecting academic integrity is a valid reason.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author acted within institutional policies, maintained confidentiality, and prevented unfair advantage. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
