Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting two classmates cheating during a final exam. The situation is at a university, and the professor handled it by catching them and taking their tests.\n\nFirst, consider the rules. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. Most institutions have clear policies against it because it's unfair to other students and undermines the integrity of the education. The author noticed notecards and saw one student checking another's test. That's direct evidence of cheating.\n\nThe author's method of reporting was discreet\u2014they wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and gave the info to the professor. This approach avoided confrontation and allowed the professor to handle it. The professor then monitored the situation and acted when they caught the cheaters. The cheaters didn't get to finish the exam, which likely resulted in failing the class.\n\nNow, the friends are split. Some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh given the difficulty of school. But the key points here are the academic integrity policies and the potential impact on the class curve. If the cheaters did well, it could unfairly lower others' grades. By reporting, the author upheld the rules, which is the right thing to do. While some might sympathize with the stress of exams, the institution's policies prioritize fairness. The author didn't act out of malice but to maintain justice. There's no indication of personal vendetta or false accusation here. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
