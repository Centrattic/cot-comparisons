Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone reporting two classmates for cheating on a final exam. The user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, especially in an academic setting. The professor's role is to enforce academic integrity, so the act of cheating is definitely on the students. The person who reported them did so by informing the professor discreetly. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and let the professor handle it. The professor then caught the cheaters in the act.\n\nNow, the question is whether the reporter is in the wrong. Some might argue that they took a proactive step to uphold academic standards, which is good. Others might say that it's meddling or that they were being a snitch. But in many educational systems, there are clear policies against cheating, and students are encouraged to report it. So, is the reporter following the rules or breaking them?\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The person wanted to ensure the exam was fair, which is a valid concern. The professor did take action, leading to the cheaters' failure. The friends are divided, some saying it's right because cheating is bad, others saying it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nBut in most cases, universities have strict academic integrity policies. If the professor is aware and takes action, the reporter isn't violating any rules. It's possible that the professor might have preferred the student to approach her directly, but the method used was discreet and led to the professor handling it. So, the student isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the university's policy doesn't encourage students to report cheaters, maybe they are. But I think in most places, students are allowed and sometimes encouraged to report academic misconduct.\n\nAlso, the cheaters themselves are clearly at fault. The act of having notecards and looking at someone else's test is cheating. The reporter's action led to them being caught. So, the main wrongdoers here are the cheaters, not the reporter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They took appropriate steps to report the cheating without confronting the cheaters directly, which aligns with maintaining academic integrity.\n"
