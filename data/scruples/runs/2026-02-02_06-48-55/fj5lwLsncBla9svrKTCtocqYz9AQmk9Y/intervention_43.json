Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the author noticed two students with notecards and saw them looking at each other's tests. The author then wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor caught the cheaters.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but is conflicted. Let me break this down. First, academic integrity is usually taken seriously in universities. Cheating is typically considered a serious offense, so the professor would handle it. The author's action was to inform the professor discreetly, which prevented the cheaters from continuing and allowed the professor to intervene. \n\nBut then there's the social aspect. Some friends think it's right, others say it's wrong because school is hard. The author could have felt the need to maintain fairness. However, reporting peers can strain relationships. But in terms of right or wrong, the act itself was to uphold academic standards. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to report cheating? In many academic settings, students are expected to maintain integrity. So the author's action might be seen as fulfilling that duty. On the flip side, some might argue that it's a personal choice and that the author overstepped. \n\nBut given that the professor was informed properly and the cheaters were caught, the process was followed. The author didn't take matters into their own hands but used the appropriate channel. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The friends' differing opinions highlight the social dilemma, but the action itself was ethical in an academic context.\n"
