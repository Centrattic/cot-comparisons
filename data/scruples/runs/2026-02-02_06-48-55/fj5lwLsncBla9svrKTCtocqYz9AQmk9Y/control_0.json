Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported the cheaters is in the wrong. The scenario is from a university final exam. The person noticed someone with notecards and leaned over to see another's test. They wrote a note, asked to use the restroom, gave the note to the professor, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Academic integrity is usually strict in universities. Cheating leads to automatic failure, so the professor had the authority to deal with it. The person acted by informing the professor without confronting the cheaters themselves, which might be the right approach.\n\nBut why would someone think the reporter is in the wrong? Maybe because it's a personal decision to report, and some might see it as tattling. However, in an academic setting, maintaining fairness is important. If the cheaters messed up the curve, it affects others' grades. The person did it discreetly, not causing a scene, which could be seen as responsible.\n\nAlso, the professor handled it, so the person didn't overstep. They just provided information. The cheaters are responsible for their actions. The friends' opinions are split, but the main point is whether the reporter acted appropriately according to the institution's policies.\n\nIn most cases, institutions encourage reporting cheating to maintain academic standards. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
