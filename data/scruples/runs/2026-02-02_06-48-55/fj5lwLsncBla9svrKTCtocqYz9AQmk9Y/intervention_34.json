Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a university exam, the student noticed two people cheating and informed the professor discreetly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. The professor did confirm that they caught the cheaters, so the action had a positive outcome. The student followed the right procedure by informing the professor without causing a scene, which is probably what the institution expects.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student should have focused on their own exam and not intervened. But the university policy likely encourages students to report misconduct. Also, cheating affects the fairness for all students, so preventing it is important. The student didn't act out of malice but observed and reported factual cheating. The friends' mixed opinions show that it's a grey area, but the professor's response suggests the action was justified.\n\nSo, considering the academic integrity policies and the professor's handling, the student probably isn't in the wrong. The key points are intent, following proper channels, and the professor's approval. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
