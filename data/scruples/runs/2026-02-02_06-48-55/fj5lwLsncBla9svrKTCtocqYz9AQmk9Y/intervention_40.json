Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person noticed someone had notecards and was peeking at another's test. They wrote a note, got up to the restroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then caught them in the act. The person is now getting mixed reactions from friends. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, the key points. In academic settings, cheating is a serious issue. Professors usually have policies against it, and students are expected to uphold academic integrity. The author's action led to the professor confronting the cheaters. But is there a problem with how the author reported it?\n\nThe story mentions that the author did it in a \"ninja manner,\" which might imply sneaky or underhanded. But the person did inform the professor discreetly, which could be seen as responsible because they didn't cause a disruption during the exam. The professor appreciated the note and took action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author acted as a vigilante, even though the professor has the authority to handle it. But in many universities, students are encouraged to report academic dishonesty. However, there's a line between reporting and interfering. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor, which is probably within the right process.\n\nThe friends' opinions are split. Some think it's right because cheating is bad, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But the main issue is whether the author did the right thing by reporting. Since the professor was informed and took appropriate action, the author's role was to bring the issue to the authority's attention, which is the correct procedure. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
