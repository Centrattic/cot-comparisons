Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam where the student noticed someone with notecards and another peeking at a neighbor's test. The student wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse to give it to the professor, who then caught them in the act.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and ethics here. In academic settings, cheating is a serious offense, and professors usually have policies to handle it. The student's action led to the professor taking appropriate action, which is part of maintaining academic integrity. \n\nSome might argue that the student was overstepping by reporting anonymously, but in this case, the student did it in a way that allowed the professor to act, and the professor did handle it. The friends' opinions are split, but the key is whether the action was justified.\n\nIs there a moral obligation to report cheating? Some might say yes, to prevent unfair advantages. Others might say it's meddling, but in an exam setting where cheating is prohibited, reporting it is part of upholding standards. The student didn't confront them directly but used the professor, which is the correct channel.\n\nAlso, the consequence is automatic failure, which is a class rule. The student's action followed the proper procedure by informing the professor. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted within the system to maintain fairness.\n"
