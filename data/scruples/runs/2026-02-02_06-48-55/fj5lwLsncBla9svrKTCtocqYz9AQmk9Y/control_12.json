Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two others using notecards and looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor, who then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity. The professor has a responsibility to enforce rules, so the person did act in accordance with the institution's policies. However, some might argue that the person could have approached it differently, like speaking directly to the professor without a note. But the professor still ended up handling it, so maybe the method was just a way to do it discreetly.\n\nOn the other hand, others might say that the person was overstepping by becoming a tattletale, especially if they have a personal stake or if the cheaters have extenuating circumstances. But the exam was important, and cheating could affect everyone's grades. The user's friends had mixed reactions, some supporting and others thinking it's harsh.\n\nLegally and academically, most schools have clear policies against cheating, so the person acting to report it is within their rights. The professor's actions confirm that the cheaters were indeed penalized. So ethically, the person did the right thing to maintain fairness. The fact that the professor was already aware and took action suggests that the person's intervention was valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
