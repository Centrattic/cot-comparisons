Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is during a university final exam, the person noticed two students cheating by using notecards and looking at each other's tests. The person wrote a note, went to the bathroom, told the professor, and the professor then caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. If the professor has a policy against cheating, then the person acted responsibly by reporting it. Academic integrity is usually a big deal in schools. Cheating can affect everyone's grades, especially if the class uses a curve, as mentioned here. The person might be protecting fairness for others.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person was tattling or overstepping. But the key here is that the professor was informed, and she handled it. The person didn't just confront the cheaters but used the proper channel. The professor's response was to monitor and then take action, which suggests the person did the right thing.\n\nAlso, the friends have mixed opinions. Some say it's right because the cheaters were stupid, others say it's wrong because school is hard. But the main point is whether the act of reporting was wrong. Since the person provided evidence (the note) and didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene, it seems appropriate.\n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the professor's action was in line with the rules. The person's action ensured the system worked as intended. Unless there's some malice, like personal grudges, which isn't indicated here, the person is in the right. So answer B (No).\n"
