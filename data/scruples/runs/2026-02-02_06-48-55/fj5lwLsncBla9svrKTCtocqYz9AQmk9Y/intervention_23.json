Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the author noticed two people cheating by using notecards and looking at someone else's test. They reported it to the professor cleverly, and the professor caught them later.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if others agree. Let me break this down. First, cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but discreetly informed the professor. That seems responsible because the professor can handle it without escalating. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is being a \"rat,\" which could create a hostile environment. However, in this case, the professor already confiscated the tests and took action. Cheating leading to automatic failure is a consequence students should know about. The author's action prevented unfair advantage, which benefits the whole class. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author overstepped by involving the professor. But since the professor was present and could verify the situation, it seems appropriate. Friends have mixed opinions, but the key is that the action was taken to maintain fairness. \n\nI think the right answer here is B (not in the wrong). The author acted ethically by upholding academic standards without causing unnecessary confrontation. Cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is a duty to ensure fairness. The method used was smart to avoid direct conflict and let the professor handle it. So, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
