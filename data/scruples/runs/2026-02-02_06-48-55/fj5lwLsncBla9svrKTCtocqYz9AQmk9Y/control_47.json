Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two classmates cheating by having notecards and looking at each other's tests. The author wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught and not returning. Now friends are divided on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally against academic integrity policies. Reporting it might be seen as responsible, especially since the professor handles it. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, affecting their grades and possibly their academic standing. The author's intent was to uphold fairness, which is commendable, but the consequences are severe.\n\nThen, there's the social angle. Reporting peers can cause tension. Some friends think the cheaters were at fault for trying to cheat, while others think the reporter was too harsh. The question is whether the method of reporting was appropriate. The author did it discreetly, which might mitigate some criticism about being a snitch.\n\nThe university's policies matter here. If the professor is supposed to handle cheating incidents, then the student acting as a whistleblower might be following the protocol, even if it's through an unconventional method. However, if there's an official process that should be followed, the student might have bypassed it, which could be a problem.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the cheaters: automatic failure is a serious consequence. The author might feel guilty about that, but it's part of the academic rules. On the other hand, the cheaters put themselves at risk by trying to cheat.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author overstepped by not going through the proper channels, but in this scenario, the professor was informed, so it's within the system. The key points are upholding integrity versus the social cost. Since the action led to the cheaters being caught as intended, the author likely did the right thing according to the policies, even if it was done in a sneaky way.\n"
