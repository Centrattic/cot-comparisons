Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, which probably has strict academic integrity policies. The person noticed two students cheating by using notecards and peeking at each other's tests. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor then caught the cheaters. The friends are divided on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of universities regarding cheating. Typically, academic dishonesty is taken seriously, and students are encouraged to report such incidents. The author's action led to the professor addressing the situation, which is in line with maintaining fairness. However, some might argue that the author acted out of spite or to gain an advantage by helping the curve. But the author's reason was to prevent unfair advantage for the class, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the method of reporting\u2014using a note and excusing themselves\u2014could be seen as sneaky, but the outcome was that the cheaters were caught. The professor's response indicates that the action was appropriate. The friends' mixed reactions don't necessarily validate the cheaters' actions. Cheating leads to failure, so the author's action prevented unfair outcomes. \n\nI think the key points are the university's stance on cheating, the appropriate method of reporting, and the intent behind the action. The author followed a proper channel (the professor) and didn't take matters into their own hands beyond informing the authority. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
