Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who reported two cheaters in an exam is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The person noticed someone had notecards and then another student looking over their shoulder. They wrote a note and told the professor, who then caught them. Friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating undermines academic integrity, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. However, some might argue that it's a personal choice to report, and others might think it's meddling. But in academic settings, there's usually a responsibility to report misconduct. The professor handled it, so the person followed the proper channel. \n\nThen there's the method they used. They went through the professor, which is the correct procedure. If they had done something else, like public shaming, that might be different. Here, they discreetly informed the professor, which is appropriate.\n\nThe consequences are that the cheaters might fail the class. Some people might say that's harsh, but the policy states it's automatic failure. The person didn't act outside the rules; they brought it to the right authority. \n\nFriend opinions are divided, but the key factor is whether the action was within the rules and ethical. Since the person didn't violate any policies and acted to uphold academic standards, they're probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
