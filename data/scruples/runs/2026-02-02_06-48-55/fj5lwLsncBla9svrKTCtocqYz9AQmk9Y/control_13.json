Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the author noticed two students cheating by having notecards and looking at others' tests. The author wrote a note to the professor, went to the restroom, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider university policies on academic integrity. Reporting cheating is generally seen as upholding those standards. The professor took action, so the author's action was effective. However, the friends are split: some say it's right, others say it's wrong because school is hard. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Was there a proper way to report cheating? The author used a note and asked to go to the restroom, which might be a discreet method if done in a way that avoids confrontation. However, sometimes institutions have specific procedures for reporting, like immediately informing the proctor. But in this case, the professor acknowledged the note and acted. \n\nAnother point is the intent. The author's motivation was to prevent cheating, which affects the curve. The cheaters could have unfairly benefited, harming others. The author didn't act out of spite but to maintain fairness. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by not directly confronting the cheaters or using the official method. \n\nAlso, the outcome: the professor handled it, and the cheaters were caught. So the action led to a resolution. The question is whether the method was appropriate. If the university allows students to report misconduct discreetly, then it's okay. But if the protocol is to inform the proctor immediately, then the author's method might not be the best. \n\nBut the professor did respond, so maybe the method worked. The key here is whether the author acted in accordance with institutional policies. Since the scenario doesn't mention any policy violations, and the professor handled it, the action might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author should not have taken the initiative, but in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report unethical behavior. The automatic failure for cheating is a strict policy, so the author's report led to that, which is fair. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
