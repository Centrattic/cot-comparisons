Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating was in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the author noticed someone had notecards and another person leaning over to see someone else's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the info to the professor. The professor then caught them in the act, and they got their tests confiscated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In an academic setting, cheating is a serious offense, and institutions usually have policies against it. The professor's role is to enforce these policies. The author's action led to the professor being informed, which resulted in the cheaters being caught.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. On one hand, reporting cheating might be seen as the right thing to do, especially since it's a final exam that could affect the class curve. The professor confirmed that cheating results in automatic failure, so the author's action might prevent unfair advantages.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not the student's responsibility to police others. However, in many academic institutions, students are encouraged to report academic dishonesty to maintain integrity. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor discreetly, which is a standard procedure.\n\nThe friends' mixed reactions also indicate that there's a debate. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But the key point is whether the author violated any rules. Since the professor handled it and the cheaters were caught, the author followed the proper channel.\n\nSo, considering academic integrity policies and the need to report misconduct through appropriate channels, the author's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
