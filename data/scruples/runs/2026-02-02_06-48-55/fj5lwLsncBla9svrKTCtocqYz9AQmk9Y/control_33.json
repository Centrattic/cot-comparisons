Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was wrong here. So, the situation is about someone catching two people cheating on a final exam and reporting them. The question is whether the author is at fault for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The exam is in a university setting, and the professor's policy is that cheating leads to automatic failure. The author noticed notecards and someone peeking, then discreetly informed the professor, who then caught the cheaters. The friends have mixed reactions, some saying it's right because cheating is bad, others saying it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nSo, the main points to analyze: Did the author act within the bounds of academic integrity? Cheating is against academic policies, so reporting it is usually considered the right thing. The method of reporting was through the professor, which is the proper channel. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene or conflict. They used a restroom break to pass the note, which is a thoughtful way to avoid alerting the cheaters. The professor then handled the situation, which seems appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is interfering or being a \"ninja,\" but in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report cheating to uphold fairness. The cheaters risked failure, but that's the consequence of their actions. The author didn't have malicious intent; they wanted to maintain the exam's integrity. \n\nAnother angle: Could the author have been mistaken? Maybe, but the evidence they observed (notecards, leaning over) seems pretty clear. The professor confirmed the cheating, so the report wasn't a false accusation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, most institutions support reporting misconduct. The author acted in the class's best interest to prevent unfair advantage. Friends saying school is hard don't negate the fact that cheating is a violation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed proper procedures and acted to uphold academic standards.\n"
