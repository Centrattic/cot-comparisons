Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university setting where someone noticed two classmates cheating during a final exam. The person wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. Reporting cheating can be seen as upholding academic integrity, which is important. However, some might argue that it's meddling or that the person is a \"snitch.\" \n\nThe user mentioned that friends are split on the issue. Some think it's right because the cheaters were being stupid, others say it's wrong because school is hard. The key points are the action taken (discreetly reporting), the potential consequences (failing the class), and the context (it's a final exam with an automatic fail for cheating).\n\nLegally and academically, universities usually have policies against cheating, and students are expected to report it. So the action aligns with academic rules. But morally, it depends on one's perspective. Some might think it's the right thing to do, others might feel it's interfering.\n\nThe method of reporting was clever but not confrontational. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor, which is the proper channel. The professor handled the situation, so the author wasn't taking matters into their own hands beyond the established procedures.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for personal gain, like affecting the curve, but the author didn't explicitly admit to that. The main motivation here seems to be upholding fairness.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty and integrity are virtues. So reporting cheating is seen as a positive action. But in some social contexts, being a \"tattletale\" is frowned upon, which could explain the mixed reactions from friends.\n\nConsidering all this, the author likely isn't in the wrong because they followed proper procedures and acted to maintain academic integrity without personal gain as the primary motive. So the answer would be B (No), but I need to check if there's any nuance I missed.\n"
