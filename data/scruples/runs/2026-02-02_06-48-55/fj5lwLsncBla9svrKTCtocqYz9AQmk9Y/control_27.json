Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is about a university exam where someone noticed two students cheating and reported them to the professor. The friends are divided, some say it's right, others think it's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense, so reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. The person might have felt a duty to uphold academic integrity. On the other hand, some might argue that the students should have been given a chance to explain or that the reporter was being harsh.\n\nThe professor was informed, and the cheaters were caught. The consequences for them were severe, which could affect their academic standing. The reporter might have felt that the cheaters were getting an unfair advantage, especially if the exam affects the class curve. However, others might say that the reporter was being a tattletale or that the cheaters made a mistake that they should be allowed to learn from.\n\nIn academic settings, policies usually encourage reporting academic dishonesty. So the reporter might be following the correct protocol. The fact that the professor handled it and the cheaters were caught suggests that the process worked as intended. The friends' mixed reactions highlight that opinions vary, but the key is whether the action was justified by the institution's rules and ethical standards.\n\nI think the main point is that the reporter acted in accordance with academic integrity policies. Unless there was a personal vendetta or unnecessary malicious intent, reporting cheating is generally not considered wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
