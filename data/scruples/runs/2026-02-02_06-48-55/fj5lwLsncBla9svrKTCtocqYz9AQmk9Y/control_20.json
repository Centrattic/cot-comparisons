Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is in a university setting, during a final exam.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Reporting cheating can be seen as upholding academic integrity. Cheating is against the rules, so if the professor's policy is strict, then reporting might be the right thing. The person did notice the notecards and the act of looking at another's test, which are clear violations.\n\nBut then, there's the other side. Some might argue that the person should have addressed it in another way, like talking to the professor after the exam. The user did approach the professor discreetly, which could be seen as trying to handle it without causing a scene during the test. The professor did take action, so maybe the user's method was appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. Cheating can affect the grading curve and unfair advantage. By reporting, they might prevent unfair outcomes for other students. However, some friends think it's wrong because school is hard, and maybe the cheaters were just struggling. But the rules are in place for a reason, so breaking them should have consequences.\n\nThe key points here are: the user acted when they saw cheating, reported it through the proper channel (the professor), and didn't cause a disruption. The professor handled the situation, leading to the students being caught. The user's action led to consequences for the cheaters, which is in line with academic policies.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the user acted impulsively, but their method was cautious. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused issues. Instead, they used the restroom excuse to report the incident. It's a bit of a \"ninja\" move, but effective.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user followed the right procedure by informing the professor, and the action was justified to maintain academic standards. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
