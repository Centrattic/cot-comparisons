Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the author noticed someone had notecards and leaned over to look at another's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor, who then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings, and professors usually have policies to handle it. The author's action was to report the cheating, which might be seen as doing the right thing to uphold academic integrity. However, some might argue that the author was interfering or that the cheaters deserved a chance.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the academic honesty policies of the university. If the university encourages students to report cheating, then the author is following the rules. On the other hand, if there's a policy against students reporting each other, then the author might be wrong. However, most institutions do encourage reporting unethical behavior to maintain fairness.\n\nAnother aspect is the method used. The author wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, which seems responsible. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene or conflict. The professor was able to handle the situation properly, and the cheaters were caught. This suggests that the author acted appropriately within the system.\n\nThe friends' opinions are split, but the outcome is that the cheaters might fail. The author's action preserved the integrity of the exam for the rest of the class. Cheating does give an unfair advantage, especially in a curved class, so preventing that could be in everyone's interest.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have discussed it with the professor privately after the exam instead of during it. But in this case, the author did act during the exam and got the professor's attention without causing disruption. The professor's response was to handle it, so the action was effective.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intent was to maintain fairness, and the method was appropriate. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
