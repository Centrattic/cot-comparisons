Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing by reporting the cheaters. So, the situation is in a university setting during a final exam. The author noticed two people cheating: one had notecards under their test, and the other was peeking over their shoulder. The author wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor then caught them in the act.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a form of academic dishonesty, which most institutions take seriously. By reporting the cheating, the author is upholding academic integrity. However, some might argue that the author is a tattletale, especially if the cheaters were friends or if there's a culture of not ratting out peers. \n\nOn the other hand, the consequences of cheating are severe here\u2014automatic failure in the class. The professor confirmed she caught them, so the cheaters face the repercussions. The author didn't confront them directly, which might be seen as a responsible way to handle the situation without escalating it unnecessarily. \n\nBut then there's the social aspect. The friends are split: some think the author did the right thing by maintaining fairness, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But isn't cheating inherently wrong regardless of difficulty? If the class is curved, cheating could affect others' grades, so reporting might be in the interest of fairness.\n\nLegally and institutionally, universities usually have policies against cheating, and students are often encouraged to report such incidents. The author followed the proper procedure by informing the professor, which is the correct channel. There's no indication the author acted out of malice, just a desire to enforce rules.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried to handle it privately first, like confronting the cheaters directly. But in an exam setting, that's impractical and could be disruptive. The best course of action in such a controlled environment is to inform the proctor, which the author did.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author seems to be in the right. Reporting cheating maintains academic standards and ensures fairness. Even though there's social backlash, the ethical obligation is to report. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
