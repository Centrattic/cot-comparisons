Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author noticed a student with notecards and then saw him lean over to look at another's test during a final exam. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then caught the two students and took their tests. The author is now getting mixed reactions from friends.\n\nThe key points here are about academic integrity. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. The university's policies usually encourage students to report such incidents to maintain fairness. The author's method of reporting\u2014writing a note and discreetly giving it to the professor\u2014seems like a responsible way to handle it without causing a scene during the exam. The professor did act on it, which led to the cheaters being caught.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was too involved or that they overstepped by becoming a \"snitch.\" But in most educational institutions, students are expected to uphold academic standards. The alternative of not reporting it could allow unfair advantages, which affects the whole class. The professor's role is to enforce rules, so the author is likely following the right protocol.\n\nAlso, the author had a legitimate concern about the curve, which is a real issue in some courses. The automatic failure for cheating is a standard consequence, and the author didn't impose that; the professor did. So the author is not directly responsible for the failure, just for reporting the observed cheating.\n\nConsidering all this, the action seems justified. The author isn't in the wrong for doing what's right by the rules and integrity of the class.\n"
