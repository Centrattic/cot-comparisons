Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two students for cheating during a final exam. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed their neighbor had notecards and then leaned over to check another student's test. They wrote a note to the professor, used the restroom as an excuse to leave the test, and the professor handled it. The students were caught and didn't return. The author is now being criticized by some friends for doing the right thing and others for being too harsh.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. Cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it is usually seen as the right thing. However, there's the aspect of privacy and personal judgment. Was the author justified in their actions?\n\nThe professor's response was appropriate. She handled it discreetly, as the author did the same. The key here is whether the author acted responsibly. Since they didn't confront the students directly but informed the professor, their method was respectful of the process.\n\nSome might argue that the author is overstepping, but in an academic setting, maintaining integrity is a collective responsibility. The alternative is allowing cheaters to gain an unfair advantage, which can affect grades for others. The class curve being mentioned is a relevant point here.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a valid reason to report, observed the cheating, and used a discreet method. Friends' opinions are split, but the professor's action shows she agreed. So, the author's action aligns with institutional policies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author acted appropriately to uphold academic standards without unnecessary confrontation.\n"
