Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting the cheaters. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user took a final exam and noticed someone next to them had notecards under their test. Then they poked the friend in front and leaned over to see their exam. The user wrote a note about this, went to the restroom, gave the note to the professor, who then handled it. The professor caught them in the act, took their tests, and they didn't return. The friends are split on whether the user did the right thing. Cheating leads to automatic failure in the class.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is at fault. Let me think about the factors here. \n\nFirst, academic integrity is usually taken seriously in universities. Cheating is against the rules, and students are often expected to report violations. However, there's also the aspect of personal ethics and the potential consequences for the cheaters. Some might argue that the user did the right thing by upholding the integrity of the exam and the class. Others might say that it's unkind or that the user acted out of spite or to improve their own standing by making the cheaters look bad.\n\nThe user's method of reporting was discreet\u2014they wrote a note and used the restroom as an excuse. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have led to a scene. The professor handled it, and the cheaters were caught. The user didn't interfere during the exam, just informed the professor. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the user overstepped by being a \"snitch\" and that it's not their responsibility to police others. But in many academic settings, students are encouraged to report misconduct to maintain fairness. The professor's role is to enforce the rules, so the user acted within the system by reporting to the professor.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the class curve. If the cheaters did well, it could lower grades for others. The user's action might prevent unfair advantages. However, the user's motivation could be questioned\u2014were they acting selflessly or out of a desire to improve their own grades by affecting the curve? The user didn't mention this explicitly, but the note about the curve is part of their reasoning.\n\nThe cheaters, on the other hand, are clearly in violation of the academic policies. The automatic failure is a consequence they brought upon themselves. The user's action led to this outcome, but they followed the proper procedure by informing the professor rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between doing what's right and the personal cost. However, in this case, the user used the appropriate channel (the professor) and didn't escalate it beyond that. Their method was discreet and respectful of the exam setting.\n\nSo considering all these points, the user likely did the right thing by reporting the cheating. They upheld the rules, followed the correct procedure, and didn't act out of malice. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
