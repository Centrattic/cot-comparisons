Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university exam where the student noticed two people cheating. The student wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and informed the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and universities usually have policies against it. The student here is following the rules by reporting the cheating. The professor handled it, so the student didn't take matters into their own hands. That's a point in their favor.\n\nBut some might argue that the student was being a snitch, especially if they had a personal grudge or if the cheaters were friends. However, in this case, the student didn't know them personally; they just noticed the cheating. The motivation here is to uphold academic integrity, which is a positive intent.\n\nAnother angle is the method used. The student discreetly informed the professor without causing a scene, which shows they were respectful of the exam environment. The professor then took appropriate action. There's no indication that the student exaggerated or acted out of malice.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might say that in a difficult academic setting, students are under stress and cheating can happen. But the university's policy likely states that cheating leads to failure, so the student is just enforcing existing rules. \n\nThe friends' mixed reactions are expected, but the key point is whether the action was right according to the institution's rules. Since the student followed the correct procedure, they aren't in the wrong. They protected the fairness of the exam for everyone else. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted responsibly and within the guidelines to maintain academic integrity.\n"
