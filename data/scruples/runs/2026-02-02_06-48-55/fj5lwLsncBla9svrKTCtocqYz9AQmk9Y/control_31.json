Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating students is in the wrong. The situation is in a university setting during a final exam. The person noticed two students with notecards and saw one of them looking at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the professor, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity, so the professor is supposed to enforce the rules. The person reporting it might be upholding the standards. But some might argue that it's not their place to act as a tattletale. However, the note was given discreetly, which shows they wanted to inform the professor without causing a scene, which makes sense to avoid disturbing the exam.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the professor's role. The professor was already monitoring the exam, and the student's note helped her catch the cheaters. The cheaters would have faced consequences regardless, but the student's action was necessary for the professor to act. So in this case, the student's action was in line with maintaining fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, some friends think it's wrong because school is hard, but the rules are there for a reason. Cheating undermines the system and is usually penalized. The student's action might have prevented grade inflation in the class due to the curve, which benefits others. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the student should have approached the professor after the exam? But in this case, they did it discreetly during the exam, which is a common practice in such situations to prevent cheating. \n\nAnother angle: Did the student overstep? If the professor was already monitoring, maybe the students would have been caught without the note. But since they were caught after the student's report, the action was effective. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the person isn't in the wrong. They acted within their right to report cheating, which is a violation of academic integrity. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
