Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating during an exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university setting, which might have specific policies on academic integrity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person noticed notecards and saw the students looking at each other's tests. That's clear cheating. The author then discreetly informed the professor, which led to the professor catching them. Some friends think it's right because cheating is bad, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. So I need to weigh the ethical aspects. Reporting cheating is often seen as a duty to maintain academic integrity, especially when it affects others (like the class curve). However, there's a debate about personal responsibility versus judgment. Did the author overstep by being a \"snitch,\" or was it the right thing to do?\n\nUniversity policies usually encourage students to report violations. The professor handled it, so the process was followed. The main issue here is whether the act of reporting is considered wrong. Since the author didn't confront them directly but reported through the proper channel (professor), it's likely within the rules. Friends' mixed reactions suggest differing opinions, but the key point is that the action was taken to uphold academic standards.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because they reported the cheating, which is the correct procedure. But maybe there's a nuance. If the professor already caught them, the author's role might be seen as helpful. However, some might argue it's a betrayal of peers. But generally, academic institutions prioritize integrity, so reporting is expected.\n"
