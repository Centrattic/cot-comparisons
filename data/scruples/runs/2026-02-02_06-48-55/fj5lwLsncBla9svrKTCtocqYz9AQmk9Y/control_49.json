Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out which one makes more sense.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person noticed someone had notecards and was peeking at another student's test. They wrote a note, used the bathroom as an excuse to give the note to the professor, and the professor then caught the cheaters. The person is getting mixed reactions from friends.\n\nSo, the main points here are academic integrity, the method of reporting, and the consequences. The person didn't confront the cheaters directly but instead informed the professor discreetly. The professor then handled the situation. \n\nCheating is against academic policies, so reporting it is generally considered the right thing to do. However, the method here was using a note and the bathroom trip. Was that necessary? Maybe they wanted to avoid confrontation or embarrassment. The professor appreciated it and took action without public shaming, which might be better for everyone involved.\n\nSome friends say it's right because the cheaters deserved it for risking the class curve. Others say it's wrong because cheating is common and hard, so maybe it's not the reporter's place. But the key here is that the professor was informed, and the cheaters were caught. The reporter didn't take matters into their own hands beyond reporting. \n\nIs there a reason to think the reporter is wrong? Maybe if they had personal vendettas or did it out of spite. The scenario doesn't mention that. The motivation here seems to be maintaining fairness, which is a valid reason. Also, the professor handled it, so the reporter didn't go beyond their role. \n\nAnother angle: in some cases, people might argue that it's not one's place to enforce rules, but in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report violations. The university has policies for a reason, and the reporter followed the proper channel by informing the professor. \n\nSo, the action was within the guidelines, and the method was clever to avoid disrupting the exam. The consequences were dealt with by the professor, not the student. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
