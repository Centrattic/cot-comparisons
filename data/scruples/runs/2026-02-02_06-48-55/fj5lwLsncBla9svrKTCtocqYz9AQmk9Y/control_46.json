Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two classmates for cheating during a final exam. The situation is in a university setting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. The author noticed the cheating, documented it with a note, and discreetly informed the professor. The professor then confirmed the cheating and took action. The outcome was that the cheaters failed the class. \n\nSome friends think the author did the right thing because cheating is wrong, especially on a final that affects the class curve. Others argue that school is hard, so maybe the cheaters had a reason. But academic policies usually have strict consequences for cheating, like automatic failure, to deter others and maintain fairness.\n\nThe author's method of reporting was through the proper channel (the professor), which is the correct procedure. They didn't take matters into their own hands beyond informing the professor. The professor handled the situation, so the author isn't directly responsible for the cheaters' failure\u2014they were just following protocol.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue about the motives. Was the author trying to help the class curve? If the cheaters performed well, the curve could hurt others. But the main duty is to report cheating regardless of personal reasons. The author's action was in line with academic integrity policies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted appropriately by reporting the cheating through the right channels. They didn't do anything unethical. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
