Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam where the author noticed two students cheating. The author wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting cheating is usually seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed it differently, like speaking to the professor immediately instead of using a note. But the professor did handle it, so the outcome was positive in terms of preventing unfair advantage.\n\nThe friends' opinions are split. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh. The key points here are the rules of the institution. If the university's policy encourages reporting cheating, then the author is justified. Also, the method used was discreet, avoiding confrontation, which could be seen as responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author acted out of personal motive, like wanting to affect the curve. But the author mentions the difficulty of the exam and the impact on the class curve, suggesting a genuine concern for fairness. \n\nCheating is a serious offense, and the professor's actions (confiscating tests, taking them out) show they took it seriously. The author's action led to justice, so from an academic integrity standpoint, it's correct. However, if the author had a personal grudge or motive, that could be a problem. The scenario doesn't mention any personal vendetta, so it's more about upholding standards.\n\nIn most academic settings, students are encouraged to report cheating. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
