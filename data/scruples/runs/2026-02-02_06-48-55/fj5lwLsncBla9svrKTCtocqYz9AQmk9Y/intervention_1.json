Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The person noticed the cheating, wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them. The friends are divided; some think it's right because cheating is bad, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nThe key points here are about academic integrity. Most universities have policies against cheating, and students are encouraged to report it. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor, which is the proper procedure. However, some might argue that the author was meddling or that the cheaters deserved a chance. On the other hand, the professor handled it, so the author followed the correct protocol.\n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. From a deontological view, doing the right thing regardless of consequences would mean reporting cheating. Utilitarianism might look at the outcome: preventing unfair advantage for others. The author's action helped maintain fairness for the class. However, some might feel it's a betrayal of peers, but the university's rules are there to prevent cheating.\n\nThe author's method was discreet, which is good. If they had made a scene, it could be different, but they acted responsibly. Since the professor confirmed she would handle it, the author followed the right steps. So, the answer likely is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
