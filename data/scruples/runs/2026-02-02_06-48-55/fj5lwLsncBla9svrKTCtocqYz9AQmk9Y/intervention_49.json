Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by reporting two students for cheating on an exam.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The author noticed someone had notecards and then leaned over to see another student's test. They wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, leading to the professor catching them. The friends are split on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nThe key points here are academic integrity and the responsibility of students. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. By reporting the cheating, the author is upholding the rules set by the institution. The professor confirmed the action was taken care of, so the process was followed.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's harsh, especially if the students were under pressure. But the rules are clear: cheating leads to failure. The author didn't confront them directly, just informed the professor, which is the proper channel. \n\nThe author's action was in line with the expected behavior to maintain fairness. Even if friends are divided, the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong. The consequences for cheating are the professor's responsibility, not the student's. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they took the appropriate step to report cheating through the correct authority.\n"
