Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student who witnessed two classmates cheating during a final exam and reported them by discreetly informing the professor. The person is split on opinions from friends and wants to know if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the student noticed notecards and someone leaning to see another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor then caught the cheaters. The cheaters face automatic failure. The question is whether the reporting student is in the wrong.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. On one hand, cheating is dishonest and undermines the academic integrity of the class. Reporting it could be seen as upholding the values of the institution and ensuring fair grading for all. On the other hand, some might argue that it's harsh to ruin someone's class just because of cheating, especially if the student is struggling. Also, there's a social aspect where some people might feel it's not their place to snitch, even if it's cheating.\n\nThe person who reported did so in a way that didn't cause a scene during the exam, which is commendable. However, the act of reporting could lead to severe consequences for the cheaters. The friends' divided opinions also reflect the complexity of the situation. Some see it as doing the right thing by promoting fairness, while others think it's too harsh, considering the academic pressure.\n\nI should consider if there's any malicious intent here. The reporter didn't seem to act out of spite but rather a sense of duty. However, the outcome is that two students might fail, which is a significant consequence. In academic settings, cheating is generally considered a serious offense, so the professor's response is appropriate.\n\nBut is the reporter in the wrong? If the action was to maintain fairness in the class, then maybe not. However, some might argue that it's not their responsibility to police others, even in a classroom. The line between upholding academic integrity and being a tattletale can be blurry.\n\nIn many academic institutions, the policy is that students are expected to report cheating. So from that standpoint, the reporter is following the rules. But personally, some might feel conflicted because it affects the cheaters' grades. However, the rules are there for a reason, so enforcing them is part of the system.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The decision to report was within the bounds of academic policies and aimed at maintaining fairness. The consequences, while harsh, are a result of the cheaters' actions, not the reporter's. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
