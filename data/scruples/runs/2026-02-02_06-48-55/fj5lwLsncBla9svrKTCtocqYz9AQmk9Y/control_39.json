Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that they noticed two students with notecards and leaning over to see another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is against academic integrity policies. If the professor has a policy against it, then the students who cheated are the ones in the wrong. The person reporting them is following the rules by informing the professor. But some might argue that it's a personal choice to report or not, and maybe the students were under stress. However, the act of cheating itself is a violation, so reporting them is upholding the rules. The person didn't do anything illegal; they just informed the professor as per the institution's procedures. The friends' opinions are split, but the key is whether the action was justified. Since the person didn't act out of malice and followed the proper channel, they are not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
