Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two students cheating. One had notecards underneath their test, and then they leaned over to see another person's test. The author wrote a note about this, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters and they didn't return, probably failing the class.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The friends are split: some think they did the right thing because the cheaters were stupid, others say it's wrong because school is hard. The author's action led to the cheaters failing, which is an automatic consequence in the class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is a serious academic violation. Reporting it is generally seen as upholding integrity. The author didn't confront them directly but discreetly informed the professor, which is a standard procedure. The professor then took action. So from an academic integrity standpoint, the author is probably in the right. \n\nBut then there's the argument that school is hard, and maybe the cheaters were under stress. However, the rules are clear: cheating leads to failure. The author's action prevented unfair advantage, which affects the curve for the class. The class is small, so two cheaters could significantly impact others' grades. By reporting them, the author protected the fairness of the exam for everyone else.\n\nAnother angle: the method of reporting. The author used a note and went to the restroom to inform the professor. That's a respectful way to handle it without causing a scene or disrupting the exam. If they had made a public accusation, that might be different. But here, they followed the proper channel by informing the professor directly.\n\nAre there any negative aspects? Maybe the cheaters felt betrayed, but the author isn't responsible for their actions. The responsibility lies with the cheaters for violating the rules. The author's intention was to maintain fairness, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the right procedure, upheld academic integrity, and ensured fair outcomes for all students. The answer should be B.\n"
