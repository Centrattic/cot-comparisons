Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported two classmates for cheating was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: During a final exam, the person notices someone with notecards and then someone else looking at another's test. They write a note, inform the professor via a restroom break, and the professor catches the cheaters. The cheaters didn't return, likely failing the class. Friends are split on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The key points here are about academic integrity, the duty to report cheating, and potential consequences.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is against academic policies, and students are often expected to report misconduct. The author acted to uphold the rules, which could protect the fairness for the entire class. The professor handled it, which is the proper procedure. So, not in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not the student's role to police others, or that the cheaters might have had extenuating circumstances. But the exam was a high-stakes situation where cheating could affect everyone's grades (the curve). The author didn't confront them directly, just informed the professor, which is appropriate.\n\nMost institutions encourage reporting academic dishonesty. The method here was discreet but effective. The cheaters got caught, so the author fulfilled their responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
