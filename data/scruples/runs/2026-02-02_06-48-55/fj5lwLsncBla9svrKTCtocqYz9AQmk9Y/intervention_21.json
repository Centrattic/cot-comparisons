Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam is in the wrong. They want to know if it's AITA (Am I the Asshole) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author noticed someone with notecards and another person looking at a classmate's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters, who left the exam.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might have different opinions. Let's break down the key points. Cheating is a serious academic integrity issue. If the professor has rules against it, then the cheaters are the ones violating the policies. The author's action was to report the cheating, which is typically seen as the right thing to do. However, some people might argue that the author was meddling or that the cheaters were in a difficult course and just made a mistake.\n\nBut in academic settings, maintaining integrity is crucial. The professor is responsible for enforcing rules, and the students are expected to adhere to them. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but reported them through the proper channel, which is the professor. The professor then handled the situation, which is the correct procedure.\n\nSome might say it's wrong because they feel it's a harsh consequence (automatic failure), but the rules are set by the institution. The author's act of reporting isn't against any rules; it's actually upholding them. Others might argue that the author should have ignored it, but that's not a solution to cheating.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They took appropriate action by informing the professor, ensuring the cheaters were dealt with according to the academic policies. The responsibility isn't on the author to judge the cheaters' circumstances but to report what they saw. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
