Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheaters in the exam is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where two students were cheating. The author noticed notecards and saw them peeking at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor intervened, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and academic integrity aspects. Cheating is generally considered unethical, and universities have policies against it. Reporting it could be seen as upholding those policies. On the other hand, some might argue that the person is overstepping or causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nThe author acted discreetly, which is commendable because they didn't disrupt the exam unnecessarily. They provided evidence (the note) and left it to the professor to handle. The professor did take action, so the author didn't confront the cheaters directly, which might avoid personal conflict.\n\nFriends are divided: some praise the action, others think it's too harsh. The key point is whether the action was within the rules. Since the professor handled it, and the students were caught, it seems the author followed the proper channel. Cheating leads to automatic failure, so the consequence is set by the institution, not the reporter.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried to talk to the cheaters first? But in an exam setting, that's impractical and could lead to confrontation. Also, the author had a right to report suspected misconduct.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author overreact? If the exam was difficult, maybe some stress about performance? But the cheaters were actively using unauthorized materials, which is a clear violation.\n\nIn academic settings, whistleblowing is generally encouraged to maintain fairness. So the author's action supports the integrity of the exam. Unless there's a policy against reporting, which isn't mentioned here, the action was appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
