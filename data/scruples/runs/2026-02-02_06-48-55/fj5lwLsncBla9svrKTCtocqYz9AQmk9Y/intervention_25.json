Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two people who were cheating on a final exam. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed someone had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another student's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters, who didn't return. The class is small, so this could affect the curve. Some friends say it's right because cheating is bad, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is reporting cheating the right thing to do? In academic settings, cheating is generally considered unethical and against university policies. The author's action led to the cheaters being caught, which upholds academic integrity. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves, or that cheating is a personal choice and the university should handle it. But in most cases, reporting cheating is encouraged. The author's method was discreet, which might be seen as a good approach to avoid confrontation. Also, the professor's response was to handle it, which suggests the author did the right thing by following the proper channel. The friends' divided opinions might reflect different moral viewpoints, but the action itself seems justified under standard academic ethics.\n"
