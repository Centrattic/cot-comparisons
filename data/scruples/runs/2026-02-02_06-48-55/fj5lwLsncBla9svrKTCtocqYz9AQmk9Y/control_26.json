Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the scenario is a university final exam. The person noticed two students cheating: one had notecards under their test, and they leaned over to look at another's paper. The author wrote a note, used the restroom excuse to give the note to the professor, and the professor then caught them in the act. The friends are split on whether this was right or wrong. The key points here are academic integrity rules and the potential consequences for the cheaters.\n\nCheating is a serious offense in academic settings. Universities have policies in place to maintain fairness. By reporting the cheating, the author is upholding those policies. However, some might argue that the author overstepped or that they were harsh. But the professor handled the situation, and the cheaters faced the consequences, which in this case is an automatic fail. \n\nThe author's method of reporting was discreet, which is good because it allows the professor to handle it without alerting the cheaters beforehand. This prevents them from continuing the cheating. The friends' opinions are split, but the majority here would likely side with the professor taking action. There's no indication that the author had malicious intent or that the report was false. The main ethical consideration is whether maintaining academic integrity justifies the action. Since cheating undermines the value of education for everyone, reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
