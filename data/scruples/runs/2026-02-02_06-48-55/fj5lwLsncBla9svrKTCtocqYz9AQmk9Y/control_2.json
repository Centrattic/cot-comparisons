Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a student who noticed two people cheating during a final exam and reported them to the professor. The friends have mixed opinions, so the person is asking whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, cheating in exams is generally considered unethical because it undermines academic integrity. The university likely has strict policies against cheating, and the professor would be expected to enforce those. The author saw the cheating, documented it by writing a note, and discreetly reported it to the professor. The professor then handled the situation, catching the cheaters in the act. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted to maintain fairness, followed the correct procedure by informing the professor, and didn't confront the cheaters directly. Cheating affects the grading curve, which could disadvantage other students. By reporting, the author ensured that the cheaters faced the consequences, which is in line with academic policies.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was being a \"snitch\" or that they shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands. But in a formal academic setting, the appropriate action when witnessing misconduct is to report it. The professor is responsible for handling such issues, so the author didn't overstep by following protocol.\n\nAlso, the cheaters were aware of the rules, yet they chose to break them. The author's actions led to them facing the automatic failure, which is a consequence they accepted by cheating. The author's intention was to uphold fairness, not to sabotage their friends. \n\nConsidering all this, the author acted correctly in reporting the cheating. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
