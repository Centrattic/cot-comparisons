Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person noticed two students using notecards and looking at another's test. They informed the professor discreetly, leading to the cheaters being caught. The friends are divided on whether this was right or wrong. The key points are academic integrity, the professor's role, and the social dynamics of reporting peers.\n\nCheating is against university policies, so exposing it could be seen as upholding academic standards. The professor is responsible for enforcing rules, so the student did their part by reporting. However, some might argue it's meddling or causing unnecessary drama. But the professor confirmed the action and handled it, which supports the student's decision. Also, cheating undermines fair grading, so preventing it benefits the class. The friends' mixed reactions show it's a common debate, but the student followed procedures. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
