Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two students for cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is in a university setting. The author noticed that two students were using notecards and peeking at others' tests during a final exam. The exam was important enough that cheating could affect the class curve. The author discreetly informed the professor, leading to the students being caught and their tests confiscated. Now friends are divided on whether the author acted correctly.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as upholding standards. On the other hand, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, leading to automatic failure. But the professor's role is to enforce rules, and the author provided evidence without confrontation, which is a responsible action.\n\nAlso, the method used\u2014writing a note and discreetly informing the professor\u2014seems appropriate. The author didn't escalate it in a way that caused a scene, which is commendable. The professor handled it, so the author wasn't overstepping by taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSome people might say it's wrong because school is hard, but cheating isn't justified. The author's action ensured fairness for others. Friends' opinions are split, but the key is whether the author acted wrongly. Since they followed the correct procedure and the professor dealt with it, the author isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
