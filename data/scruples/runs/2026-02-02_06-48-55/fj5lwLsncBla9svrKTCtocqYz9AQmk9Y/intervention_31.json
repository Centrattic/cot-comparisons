Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two classmates for cheating. The situation is a university final exam where the author noticed notecards and saw someone looking at another's test. The author then wrote a note, went to the restroom, informed the professor, and the professor caught them. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Most institutions have academic integrity policies that prohibit cheating and require reporting such incidents. By reporting, the author is upholding these rules, which is generally a positive action. However, some might argue that the author acted as a tattletale or that the classmates made a mistake due to stress.\n\nBut the key points here are that the cheating was observable, the author didn't confront them directly but reported discreetly, and the professor took care of it. The author didn't take matters into their own hands beyond informing the professor. The professor's actions then led to the students' failure, which is a consequence of the class policy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author was interfering or that the classmates had a reason to cheat because the exam was tough. However, the policy is in place for a reason, and cheating is a serious offense. The author's action prevented unfair advantage and upheld academic standards.\n\nSo, considering that the author followed the proper procedure and didn't do anything beyond reporting, it's more likely that they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
