Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed someone had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at a classmate's exam. They wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, who then caught the cheaters. The friends are divided, with some saying it's right because cheating is bad, and others saying it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is it morally right to report cheaters? Does the context matter, like the severity of the cheating or the potential impact on the class curve? Also, the method of reporting\u2014discreetly using a note and the bathroom excuse\u2014might be considered. \n\nCheating is generally considered unethical in academic settings. Universities have honor codes to maintain fairness, so by reporting it, the author is upholding those standards. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, leading to automatic failure, which could have serious consequences for them. \n\nBut then again, if the cheaters were trying to gain an unfair advantage, which affects the grading curve for everyone else, the author's action could be seen as necessary for fairness. The method of reporting was clever to avoid confrontation, which might be seen as responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, some might think that the author should have tried to handle it differently, like confronting the cheaters first or not getting involved. But in a high-stakes situation like a final exam, where the professor is present, the appropriate action is usually to report it. \n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects. Upholding integrity is important, but so is understanding the consequences for others. However, the scenario doesn't mention any malicious intent from the author; it's about maintaining fair assessment. \n\nIn most academic codes, students are encouraged to report cheating to maintain the integrity of the institution. So the author's action aligns with that. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
