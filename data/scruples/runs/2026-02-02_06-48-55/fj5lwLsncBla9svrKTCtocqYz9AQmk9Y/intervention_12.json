Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that during a final exam, they noticed someone with notecards and another person peeking at someone else's test. They wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, who then handled the situation, leading to the two students being caught and possibly failing the class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the university's policies on cheating. Usually, academic integrity is a big deal in colleges. Professors are responsible for enforcing the rules, and if a student reports cheating, it's part of their role in maintaining the integrity of the exam. So from that angle, reporting cheating might be the right thing to do.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of the student's intention. The author mentions they did it in a \"ninja manner,\" which sounds like they wanted to avoid direct confrontation while still doing the right thing. They also considered the impact on the class curve, which might be a concern for fair grading. However, some friends think it was wrong because school is hard, which raises the question: is cheating ever justified if the exam is difficult? But the rules are there for a reason, so even if it's hard, cheating isn't acceptable.\n\nAnother point is the potential consequences for the students who cheated. They might face failing the class, which is a serious outcome. But the author is in a position where they observed the cheating, so not reporting could mean letting others gain an unfair advantage. The author might feel conflicted about being a \"snitch,\" but academic institutions typically encourage students to report violations.\n\nAlso, the method used\u2014writing a note and asking for the restroom\u2014seems like a way to inform the professor without causing a scene during the exam. That's probably a good approach to maintain the exam environment while still reporting the issue.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by taking it upon themselves, even though the professor is responsible for monitoring. But in this case, the professor did take action based on the report. So the author's action led to the professor handling it appropriately.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between doing the right thing and respecting others' privacy or personal struggles. But cheating is a violation of academic standards regardless of the difficulty of the exam. So from an institutional standpoint, the author did the right thing by reporting the cheating.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They took a responsible action to uphold academic integrity without causing unnecessary disruption.\n"
