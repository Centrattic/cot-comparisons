Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating is wrong. The situation is a university final exam where the person noticed notecards and saw one student peeking at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters. Some friends think they did the right thing, others not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it is usually seen as the right action. The person here acted to uphold the rules, which is positive. But why would some think they're wrong? Maybe because it's a difficult decision, or they're worried about the cheaters' consequences. However, the professor handles the actual punishment, so the reporter isn't directly causing the failure; they're just informing. \n\nAnother angle: the method of reporting. They used a note and went to the bathroom, which is a discreet way. If they had made a scene, maybe it's different. But in this case, they followed the right procedure by informing the professor. The professor then took action. \n\nAlso, the potential impact on the class curve is mentioned. Cheating can unfairly affect others' grades, so stopping it benefits everyone. The person is protecting the integrity of their own academic environment. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe they should have confronted the cheaters directly? But in an exam setting, that's risky and could escalate. Reporting to the professor is the standard and safer approach. \n\nSo, the person is acting within their responsibility to maintain academic standards. They didn't do anything beyond the rules. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
