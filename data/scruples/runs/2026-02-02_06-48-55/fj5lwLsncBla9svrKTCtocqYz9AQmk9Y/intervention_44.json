Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating during a final exam.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author noticed someone had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another's exam. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor ended up catching them. The friends have mixed opinions\u2014some say it's right to uphold integrity, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nI should think about the rules of the university. If cheating is prohibited and students are supposed to report it, then the author is doing their duty. Cheating can indeed affect the curve, so their action might prevent unfair advantage. On the other hand, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, but the professor probably handles consequences, like failing the class, as per policy.\n\nIs there a possibility the author acted out of personal gain? If the exam curve is affected, maybe they benefit from others failing. But the post doesn't mention that. The author's main point is about catching cheating, which is against academic integrity. The professor confirmed the issue, so the action was valid.\n\nAnother angle: did the author use the proper channel? They went to the professor directly, which is appropriate. The method of informing via a note and going to bathroom was clever to avoid confrontation, but still effective. The professor's response was to handle it, which they did.\n\nSo, considering academic honesty is a core value, reporting cheating is a responsibility. The author didn't act maliciously but to enforce rules. The cheaters faced consequences, which is fair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
