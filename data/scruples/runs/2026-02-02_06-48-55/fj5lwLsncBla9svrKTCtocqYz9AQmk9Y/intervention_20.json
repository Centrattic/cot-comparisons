Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user noticed two people cheating during a final exam. One had notecards under their test, and the other was peeking. The user wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and gave the note. The professor then caught them in the act, and they didn't return. Now friends are split on whether the user did the right thing. The user thinks they might be in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity policies in universities. If the user reported it, they were upholding the rules. But maybe there's a gray area here. The user's method: writing a note during the exam and sneaking it to the professor. Was that the proper way to report cheating? Some institutions might have specific procedures, like reporting after the exam or through a designated method. The user didn't follow the official process, which could be an issue. However, the professor did act on the information and caught the cheaters.\n\nThen there's the impact. The user prevented unfair advantage, which could affect the class curve. But some might argue that the user was being a tattletale, which could create a hostile environment. However, the cheaters were caught in the act, so maybe the user's action was justified.\n\nAlso, the user had a legitimate reason to report\u2014it was a final exam where cheating could affect everyone's grades. Cheating leads to automatic failure, so the user's action led to the cheaters failing, which might be seen as harsh. But the policy is in place for a reason.\n\nThe user's friends are divided. Some say it's right because cheaters deserve to be caught. Others say it's wrong because school is hard and cheating might be a desperate act. But the user is not the one deciding the punishment; the professor and the university's policies handle that.\n\nAnother angle: the user's method of reporting. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have been risky. Instead, they discreetly informed the professor. That might be the safer and more responsible approach.\n\nIn many academic settings, students are encouraged to report cheating if they witness it. The university's policies usually support such actions to maintain integrity. So, even if the method wasn't the official procedure, the intent was to uphold academic standards.\n\nHowever, there's a possible overreach if the user was motivated by personal issues, like jealousy or rivalry. But the situation doesn't suggest that. The user's action was based on the severity of the cheating and its impact on the class.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method of reporting might have been unconventional, the intent to uphold academic integrity is commendable. The user is not in the wrong because they acted to prevent cheating, which is a violation of university policies. The professor handled the situation, and the cheaters faced consequences. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
