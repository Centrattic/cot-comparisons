Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person noticed notecards and another student leaning over to see someone else's test. They reported it to the professor discreetly, which led to the professor catching the cheaters.\n\nAcademic integrity is usually important in universities. Cheating is a serious offense, and students are expected to uphold honesty. Reporting cheating is typically seen as the right thing to do because it maintains fairness for everyone. \n\nThe friends had mixed reactions. Some thought it was right because cheating is against the rules, others thought it was harsh given the difficulty of school. But the key point here is the university's policies. If the professor confirmed the cheating, then the students involved would face consequences. The person who reported didn't do anything unethical; they followed the proper channel by informing the professor.\n\nThere's no indication that the person who reported had malicious intent. They did it discreetly and let the professor handle it, which shows they weren't seeking revenge or public shaming. Their action prevented unfair advantage, which is in line with academic standards. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
