Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. The situation is in a university setting, and the person noticed notecards and saw someone leaning over to look at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act. The friends are split on opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider academic integrity policies. In most universities, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is usually encouraged. The person didn't confront them directly but anonymously informed the professor. That's a common way to report misconduct without causing immediate confrontation. The professor did take action, which suggests that the report was valid.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person could have confronted the cheaters first or tried to warn them. However, in high-stakes exams, students might feel pressured, and the risk of cheating is real. The author's action prevented potential unfair advantage, which affects the class curve. The professor's responsibility is to maintain academic standards, so the person did the right thing by alerting her.\n\nThe friends' mixed reactions indicate that opinions vary. Some might think it's a betrayal, others see it as upholding integrity. But legally and ethically, universities typically support students reporting cheating. The method used was discreet, which is important to avoid embarrassment or conflict during the exam.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They followed proper procedures, and their action upheld academic integrity. The professor handled it appropriately, leading to the cheaters' consequences. There's no indication the author acted maliciously; it was a responsible decision.\n"
