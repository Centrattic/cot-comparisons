Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where the author noticed two students cheating by using notecards and looking at another's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the note to the professor, who then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and universities have policies against it. By reporting the misconduct, the author is upholding academic integrity. However, there's a debate here. Some might argue that the author acted as a \"snitch,\" which can create a culture of mistrust. Others would say it's the right thing to do to maintain fairness for all students.\n\nThe professor handled the situation by catching the cheaters, leading to their failure in the class. The friends are divided: some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh given the difficulty of school. The key points here are the academic policies, the immediate context of the exam, and the potential consequences for the cheaters.\n\nAnother angle: the method of reporting. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor discreetly. This might be seen as responsible because it allowed the professor to handle it without escalating tension in the room. If the author had told others or made a scene, it could have been more disruptive. But using a note and going to the restroom was a clever way to report without causing a distraction during the exam.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the class curve. The author mentioned that if the cheaters did well, they could mess up the curve. This adds another layer where the cheating could unfairly affect other students' grades. So, by stopping this, the author is protecting the academic standards and fairness for everyone else.\n\nHowever, some might question if the author overstepped by involving the professor. But in an academic setting, professors are responsible for enforcing exam policies. The author's action was within the bounds of their responsibility as a student to report unethical behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a debate about the ethics of reporting peers, the act of preventing cheating in an exam where it's strictly prohibited and could harm others' grades is generally seen as the right thing to do. The method was discreet and appropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
