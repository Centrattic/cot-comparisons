Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two students cheating by using notecards and looking at each other's exams. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, reported it to the professor, and the professor dealt with it, leading to the cheaters failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and academic integrity aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it undermines the fairness of assessments. By reporting the cheating, the person is upholding academic standards and ensuring that other students aren't disadvantaged by others' dishonesty. The professor did handle it, and the cheaters faced consequences, which seems just.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the person overstepped by ratting out peers. They might feel that it's a breach of trust or that the cheaters made a mistake and deserved a second chance. But given that the rules are clear about cheating leading to automatic failure, the reporter was probably following the correct protocol.\n\nThe key points here are the university's policies on cheating and the reporter's method. The person used a discreet way to alert the professor without confrontation, which is appropriate. Friends are divided: some think it's right because cheating is bad, others think it's harsh given the difficulty of school. But from an academic integrity standpoint, reporting cheating is usually the expected action. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
