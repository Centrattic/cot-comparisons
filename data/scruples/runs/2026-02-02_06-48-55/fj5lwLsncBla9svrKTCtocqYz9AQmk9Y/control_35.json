Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person noticed during a final exam that a student had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another's test. They wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse, gave the note to the professor, and the professor then caught the cheaters.\n\nThe key points here are academic integrity policies. Generally, universities have strict rules against cheating. Reporting cheating is usually considered the right thing to do because it upholds fairness. However, some might argue that the person involved could have approached it differently or that the cheaters were under stress.\n\nBut in this case, the person used a discreet method (writing a note when leaving for the bathroom) to inform the professor without causing a scene. The professor then took action. The cheaters were caught and likely failed the class. The person's friends are divided, but the main ethical question is whether the act of reporting was wrong.\n\nCheating undermines the educational system, and reporting it is often seen as a duty. The person didn't confront them directly but used the proper authority (professor) to handle it. There's no indication that the reporting was malicious. So, in most contexts, the person is following the right procedure. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
