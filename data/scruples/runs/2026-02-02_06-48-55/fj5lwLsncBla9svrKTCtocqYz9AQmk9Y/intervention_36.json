Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two classmates cheating on a final exam. The person noticed notecards and saw them peeking at another's test. They wrote a note, left their test with the professor, and then the professor caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. If the institution has a clear policy against cheating and encourages reporting, then the action might be justified. The professor handled it, so the process was followed. But maybe there's a question about the method. Did the person overstep? They wrote a note and left the test, which could be seen as proper if they followed the right channels. However, some might argue that it was a personal decision without consulting the professor first. But in the scenario, the professor did take action, so the process worked. Also, the person didn't do anything illegal; they reported misconduct. Friends are divided, but the key is whether the action was wrong. The person acted to maintain academic integrity, which is usually encouraged. However, some might think it's tattling or that it's better to focus on your own work. But the main point is that the professor handled it, so maybe the person did the right thing. So the answer is B.\n"
