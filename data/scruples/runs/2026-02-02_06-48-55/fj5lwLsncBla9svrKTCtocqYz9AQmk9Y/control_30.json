Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about reporting two classmates for cheating during a final exam is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person noticed someone with notecards and another looking over a friend's shoulder. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act and the cheaters didn't return. The person is now being criticized by friends, some saying it's right, others wrong.\n\nCheating is a serious academic integrity issue. University policies usually require reporting such incidents. The person acted to maintain fairness, which is a positive aspect. But some might argue that the person was overstepping, especially if the cheaters were their peers. However, the professor handled it, so the person's action was appropriate in reporting the misconduct.\n\nThe key points are: the person didn't confront them directly, which could have escalated things. They used a discreet method to inform the professor, which is responsible. The professor then took action, so the person didn't take matters into their own hands. Academic institutions typically encourage reporting violations to preserve integrity. \n\nSome might say it's wrong because it's a personal matter, but the impact on the class curve is a collective issue. The person's action prevented unfair advantage, which is in line with academic policies. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong.\n"
