Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The author noticed notecards and saw them peeking at another's test. They informed the professor discreetly. The professor then caught them. \n\nSome friends say it's right because the cheaters messed up the curve, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But the main point is whether the author acted wrongly.\n\nCheating is against academic integrity. Reporting it is usually expected. The author didn't confront them directly but told the professor, which is the proper channel. The method was sneaky but effective. \n\nHowever, maybe the author overstepped? But the professor handled it, so it's within policy. The author's action led to consequences, but they were following rules. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
