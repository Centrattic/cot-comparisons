Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating on a final exam. The situation is from a university setting. The person noticed a guy had notecards and then leaned over to look at his friend's test. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, told the professor, and the professor handled it. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Cheating is a serious academic offense, so reporting it might be seen as doing the right thing. The professor did take action, which suggests the students were indeed cheating. The person who reported didn't just accuse them but actually provided evidence through the note and then confirmed with the professor. The act of leaning over to look at someone else's test is a clear violation of exam rules.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, leading to failing the class. But the professor's role is to enforce academic integrity, so the person reporting is upholding the rules. Also, the cheaters put themselves in a position where if caught, they face consequences. The person reporting didn't do anything physically, just informed the professor appropriately. There's no indication of personal vendetta here; they pointed it out during the exam when it happened.\n\nFriends' opinions might be conflicting, but the key question is whether the person did what they should have. Academic institutions rely on students to report misconduct. So, in this case, the person acted to maintain fairness, which is part of the responsibility in an academic setting. Unless there's some malicious intent, which isn't mentioned, the person isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
