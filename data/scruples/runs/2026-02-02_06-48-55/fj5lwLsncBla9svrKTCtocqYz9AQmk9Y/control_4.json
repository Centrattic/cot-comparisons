Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is about a university final exam. The person noticed two students cheating with notecards and looking at another's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Usually, students are expected to report cheating because it's against academic integrity. The professor's role is to enforce these rules. The person here didn't confront the cheaters directly but discreetly informed the professor, which seems like a responsible action.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's not their place to report, or that they should have spoken up directly. But in many cases, reporting through the professor is the correct procedure. Also, the professor confirmed that they'll handle it, so the student followed the right protocol.\n\nCheating affects the fairness for everyone, so preventing it is important. The friends have mixed opinions, but the action led to justice. The student didn't act impulsively; they documented and reported it through proper channels. Therefore, the student likely isn't in the wrong.\n"
