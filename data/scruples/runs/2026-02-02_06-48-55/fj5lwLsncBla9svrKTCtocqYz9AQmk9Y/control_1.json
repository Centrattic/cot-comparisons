Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed someone had notecards and was looking at another person's test. They then wrote a note and told the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do. However, there's also the aspect of personal relationships. The person who reported might be seen as a \"rat,\" which can create tension in a class. Some friends think they did the right thing because cheating is dishonest, while others think it's wrong because the pressure of school is intense.\n\nThen there's the method of reporting. The author did it discreetly, using a bathroom break to inform the professor. This shows they didn't want to confront the cheaters directly, which might be seen as a responsible action to avoid confrontation.\n\nAcademic policies usually encourage students to report cheating to maintain fairness. The professor handled the situation by watching them and then taking action. The cheaters faced consequences, which is standard. So from an institutional perspective, the author followed proper procedures.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was interfering in others' academic matters. However, cheating affects everyone's grades and the integrity of the institution. The curve could be affected, as mentioned, which impacts all students. So the author's action might be justified in maintaining fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, if the cheaters were under a lot of stress and made a mistake, some might feel the author was too harsh. But the policy is clear\u2014cheating leads to failure. The author didn't make the rules; they just reported the violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within the boundaries of the academic code of conduct, maintained integrity, and followed the proper procedure. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
