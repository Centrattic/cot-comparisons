Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a student who noticed two people cheating during a final exam and reported them to the professor. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity policies in most universities. So, reporting it is usually the expected action. The author didn't just report it directly but did it in a \"ninja manner,\" which is a bit of a clever way to get the professor's attention without confronting the cheaters directly. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and handed the test to the professor. The professor then took action, and the cheaters were caught.\n\nNow, some people might argue that the author is in the wrong because they didn't talk to the professor directly during the exam, maybe disrupting it. But the author's method was to avoid direct confrontation while still informing the professor. The professor was already aware after the note and proceeded to monitor the situation, leading to the cheaters being caught. So the author's action led to the professor taking appropriate steps. \n\nOthers might say that the author is doing the right thing by upholding academic integrity. Cheating affects everyone, especially if it messes up the curve. The author's action could prevent unfair advantages for those two students. Also, the professor handled it professionally, so the outcome was managed through proper channels.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe someone could say the author was snitching or creating a hostile environment. But since it's a university setting and the professor is responsible for maintaining exam integrity, reporting cheating is part of the academic process. The author used the correct method by informing the professor, so they followed the proper procedure.\n\nAnother point is whether the author had to go to the bathroom. But the act of going to the bathroom allowed them to discreetly pass the note. It's a bit of a strategic move, but it's still within the bounds of using the facilities allowed during an exam. The professor didn't seem to mind and took the note, so that part was handled correctly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within the appropriate guidelines to maintain academic integrity without direct confrontation. They didn't report it to others but let the professor handle it, which is the right approach. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
