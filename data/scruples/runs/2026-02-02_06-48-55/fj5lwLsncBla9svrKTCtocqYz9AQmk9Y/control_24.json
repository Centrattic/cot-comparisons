Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university final, and the person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act and took their tests. The friends are split on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic violation. By reporting it, the person might be upholding academic integrity, which is generally seen as a positive action. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, leading to automatic failure, and that the person took it upon themselves to act instead of letting the professor handle it without interference.\n\nBut wait, the person didn't just inform the professor directly in front of everyone. They discreetly left a note and went to the restroom to tell the professor. The professor then handled the situation by watching them and eventually catching them. So the person didn't publicly expose them, which could be seen as a thoughtful approach to avoid embarrassment, but still ensured the professor was aware. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Whether the person acted appropriately in a situation where cheating is occurring. 2) The potential consequences of their action (the cheaters failing the class). 3) The social dynamics of friends disagreeing on the rightness of the action.\n\nAcademic policies usually encourage reporting cheating to maintain fairness. If the professor didn't know initially, the person's action could be seen as necessary. However, some might say that it's the professor's responsibility to monitor the exam, and the student shouldn't interfere. But in this case, the student provided evidence (the note) and allowed the professor to handle it, which seems like a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person didn't have a good reason to believe the professor wouldn't notice, maybe they overstepped. But the professor did confirm she would \"take care of it,\" so maybe she was already aware or the student's action prompted her to act. \n\nConsidering all that, the person's action was in line with maintaining academic integrity, and they did it in a way that let the professor handle the enforcement. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
