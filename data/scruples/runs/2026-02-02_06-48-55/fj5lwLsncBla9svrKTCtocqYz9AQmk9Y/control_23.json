Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where the student noticed two classmates cheating. The student discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider academic integrity policies. In most universities, cheating is a serious offense, and students are encouraged to report it. The professor confirmed the policy by handling the situation, so the student followed the right procedure. \n\nThe user's friends are divided: some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh. But from an ethical standpoint, upholding academic standards is important. The student didn't confront them directly, which could have caused a scene; instead, they used a discreet method. \n\nPotential counterarguments might be about the stress of exams or the cheaters' circumstances, but the policy is clear. The student acted responsibly without personal gain, so their action is justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
