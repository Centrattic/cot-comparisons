I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and really dislikes cats. They've had negative experiences, like scratches and bites. The girlfriend is okay with the cat, and when the author brings up the issue, she becomes cold and gives an ultimatum. The author is considering responding with their own ultimatum about rehoming the cat.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. They've been hurt before, and having a cat could affect their living situation. But the girlfriend feels the cat is part of the package. The question is whether the author is wrong for standing their ground.\n\nThe key points are: the author is honest about their feelings towards cats, tried to discuss it, and the girlfriend reacted strongly. The author isn't being unreasonable about the cat's existence but about their own comfort and living environment. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's response of playing hardball might be seen as equally harsh. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. However, the author's stance is about their own well-being. People have different preferences about pets, and it's a big decision when moving in together. The author isn't demanding the cat be rehomed now but is considering it as a future condition. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're expressing their needs and considering their future. The girlfriend's reaction is more confrontational. The answer is B (No).\n"
