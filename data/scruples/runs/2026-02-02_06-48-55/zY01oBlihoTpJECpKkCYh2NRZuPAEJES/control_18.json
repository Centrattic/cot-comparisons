I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether it's acceptable for the author to not want his girlfriend's cat to come with her when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He's had bad experiences with them, like scratches and bites, and finds them uncooperative. He's even thought of the cat as annoying, comparing it to hating someone intensely. He wants to move in with his girlfriend but doesn't want the cat. His girlfriend is taking a firm stance, saying they're a package deal, and even giving him an ultimatum about the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a cat and seems very attached to it. She's not willing to separate from the cat, which she considers part of her life. The author tried to suggest alternatives like the cat living with her parents, but she refused, leading to a standoff. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author's dislike for cats is strong and valid for him, even if others don't share that dislike. The girlfriend's attachment to her cat is also valid. The problem is whether the author is being unreasonable by not allowing the cat into their shared home.\n\nI should consider whether the author's stance is selfish. He's in a committed relationship and is considering marriage. His refusal might be about his comfort and lifestyle preferences. However, relationships often require compromise. But is this a fair compromise? If the cat's presence causes him significant distress, maybe it's reasonable for him to set that boundary. \n\nBut then again, if the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise and is holding the relationship hostage, maybe the issue is her not being flexible. However, the question is about the author's actions. Is it wrong for him to have a boundary about not wanting the cat? \n\nI think people have the right to set boundaries in their homes, especially if the pet is causing them stress. The author isn't asking her to get rid of the cat immediately; he's waiting until moving in. But the girlfriend is not willing to consider alternatives, like the cat staying elsewhere. \n\nBut the author's proposed solution (rehoming the cat) is a hardball approach. Is that fair? Maybe. But given her ultimatum, perhaps he's just responding in kind. However, holding the relationship hostage isn't good either. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a situation where both have valid points. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for having preferences about his living space. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, maybe the issue is hers. But the question is about the author. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in wanting his home to be a place where he's comfortable. However, the way he's approaching it (playing hardball) might be harsh, but the core issue isn't his fault. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be the problem here.\n"
