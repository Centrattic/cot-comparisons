I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. He has specific reasons like the cat's behavior\u2014scratching, biting, noise, and the general annoyance. He's been with the girlfriend for almost a year and considering moving in together. He tried to suggest alternatives like the cat staying with her parents, but she refused. She gave an ultimatum, so he's considering his own ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her pet. The cat isn't problematic beyond being a typical cat. She might see the cat as part of her life and family. The author's stance is about his own comfort and preferences, but pets are a big part of people's lives. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is a reasonable boundary or if he's being inflexible. He's not allergic, just dislikes the cat's personality. The girlfriend is equally firm. It's a conflict of values. The author is asking if he's the asshole for holding his ground. \n\nI think it's a tough call. Both have valid points. The author's preferences are legitimate, but the girlfriend's attachment to her pet is also significant. Making someone choose between a pet and a relationship is a big decision. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but maybe he is because pets are common and he's being rigid. \n\nHmm. The community often considers pets as part of the family, so expecting someone to give up their pet might be seen as unreasonable. However, the author also has his own comfort to consider. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's setting a boundary about his living environment. But maybe there's an expectation that in a serious relationship, you compromise on such issues. The girlfriend's ultimatum is harsh, but so is the author's potential response. \n\nAlternatively, the author should have addressed this earlier instead of waiting until moving in. If he brought it up at the start, maybe they could find a solution. Since he's now at the point of moving in together, it's a significant decision, and his stance is about his lifestyle. I think it's a 50-50 situation, but the answer might depend on cultural norms. In some cases, pets are non-negotiable for people. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
