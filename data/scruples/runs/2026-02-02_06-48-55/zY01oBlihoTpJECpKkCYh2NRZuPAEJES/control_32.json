I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He's had negative experiences with cats\u2014scratches, bites, and finds them unresponsive. His girlfriend has a cat, which he finds annoying. They've been dating almost a year, and he's considering marriage. When discussing moving in together, he brought up the issue of the cat. The girlfriend responded with an ultimatum: either take the cat or break up. The author is now considering matching her hard stance by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual respect in a relationship, communication, and compromise. The author's stance is based on personal dislike, which is valid, but how he's handling it might be the issue. The girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. But the author is now thinking of responding similarly. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Personal preferences are okay. The problem might be in the approach. If they can't find a middle ground, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) complicates things. But the author is also taking a hardline, which could be seen as inflexible. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's ultimatum is a significant red flag. Holding a relationship hostage isn't healthy. But the author's response, while firm, is a reaction to that. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSince he's expressed his concerns and she's unwilling to budge, maybe he's justified in setting boundaries. The core of the issue is compatibility. If both can't compromise, one might have to make a choice. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his well-being and preferences, especially if he's willing to take responsibility for the consequences. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
