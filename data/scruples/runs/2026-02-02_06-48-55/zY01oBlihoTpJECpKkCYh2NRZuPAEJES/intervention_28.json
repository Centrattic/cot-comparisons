I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by reading through the scenario again. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person who's dating a girlfriend with a cat. They've been together almost a year and are considering moving in together. The author really doesn't like cats, finds them annoying, and has had bad experiences with scratches and bites. They've discussed moving in with their girlfriend, but she's not willing to separate from her cat. When the author suggests the cat could stay with her parents, the girlfriend responds coldly and gives an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want the cat but are also worried about losing the relationship. They're considering playing hardball by saying the girlfriend can't move in until the cat is rehomed. The user, who thinks the author is in the wrong, wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's dislike for cats seems genuine and based on personal experiences. They mention the cat's behavior specifically\u2014jumping, scratching, yowling\u2014which is bothering them. They also think about the dog's compatibility with the cat. But the girlfriend is firm that the cat comes with her, which could be a deal-breaker for the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see the cat as part of her life and not something she's willing to part with. Her ultimatum suggests that the cat is a non-negotiable part of her moving in. That could indicate that the cat is important to her, perhaps even a pet she's attached to, which is understandable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat, but the girlfriend isn't budging. The author's response would be to refuse to move in unless the cat is rehomed. Is that a reasonable action? Well, if the author is clear that the cat is a deal-breaker, then it's their right to set that boundary. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also a hardline stance. \n\nBut wait, relationships require compromise. The author tried to discuss it calmly, and the girlfriend didn't respond well. Maybe the author should consider other solutions, like finding a pet-friendly living arrangement or working with the cat's behavior. But the author isn't a cat person and doesn't want to put in the effort. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. The author isn't being cruel to the cat; they just don't want it in their home. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be the bigger issue here. However, the author is also setting a boundary. If the girlfriend is not willing to compromise, the author might have to make a decision, even if it leads to the end of the relationship. \n\nSo, if the author plays hardball, is that an asshole move? Well, the author is stating their terms. If the girlfriend isn't willing to negotiate, then the author's response is a consequence of her refusal. The author isn't forcing the relationship to end; it's a mutual decision based on incompatible expectations. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for having a preference. However, if the relationship is important, they might need to find a middle ground. But the girlfriend's ultimatum is also extreme. The author's stance isn't inherently wrong, especially if they've made their feelings clear and the other person isn't compromising.\n"
