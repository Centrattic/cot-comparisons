I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He has valid reasons: the cat's behavior is annoying, and he's had negative experiences with cats. He's even mentioned being scratched and bitten. He's in a serious relationship, thinking about marriage, and moving in together. He's tried to talk to his girlfriend about the issue but she's firm, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend has had the cat for a while. She loves it, and the cat is part of her life. She's given the author an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum: rehoming the cat or not moving in.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his preferences, which is reasonable. However, relationships require compromise. The author is in a committed relationship and wants to move forward. The girlfriend's cat is a part of her life. The author's stance is that he won't compromise on this issue, leading to a potential breakup. \n\nBut is that fair? He has the right to his preferences, but moving in together is a big step. If the cat is part of her life, maybe the author should consider that. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also a problem. She's not open to negotiation, which isn't healthy either.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't wrong to have strong feelings about the cat, but he's also not wrong to want to live in a way that makes him comfortable. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like having the cat stay with her parents) is part of the issue. The author's suggestion to rehome the cat is a hard stance, but it's a response to her ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to meet halfway. If the author is willing to find a solution that works for both, like maybe temporary arrangements or compromises, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's just being rigid, that's a problem. The author's actions here are a reaction to her not being flexible. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's preferences are valid and if the girlfriend is also at fault for her ultimatum. Since the author tried to discuss it and she shut it down, maybe he's justified in his stance. However, holding an ultimatum can be seen as the author being in the wrong if it's not a health or safety issue. But the cat's presence is affecting his quality of life. \n\nI'm a bit torn, but I lean towards answer B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for his boundaries and the girlfriend's reaction was too extreme. But maybe others would see it as A because he's not compromising enough. Hmm.\n"
