I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a self-identified dog person who has always had dogs. He doesn't like cats because of their aloofness, the potential for scratches and bites, and the difficulty in training them. He's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for almost a year, and they're considering moving in together. The main conflict is that he doesn't want her cat to come with her when she moves in. When he suggested the cat could stay with her parents, she refused and gave an ultimatum: either the cat comes, or they break up.\n\nThe author feels like he's being forced to choose between the cat and the relationship. He's asking if it's an asshole move to respond with his own ultimatum, making her rehome the cat before moving in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, his dislike for cats is genuine and he has valid reasons. He's experienced issues with the cat's behavior, which he finds annoying and possibly harmful. His dog might not get along with the cat, and he's clear about his preferences. From the girlfriend's side, she's clearly attached to her cat and sees it as part of her life. Her refusal to separate from the cat is a strong stance, leading her to hold the relationship hostage, which seems extreme.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and preferences. It's understandable that he wants his living space to be comfortable for him and his dog. However, relationships often require compromise. The author's stance is a firm \"no\" to the cat, but he's willing to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) but she refused. His problem arises when she makes an ultimatum. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss the issue calmly, and when that didn't work, he's considering matching her ultimatum. But holding a relationship together shouldn't be about ultimatums. The girlfriend's response is extreme and doesn't allow for negotiation, which could be a red flag for future conflicts. However, the author's refusal to compromise on the cat might also be a problem if the cat is a significant part of her life.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid points. The author isn't wrong to have his preferences, but perhaps he could explore other solutions, like finding a middle ground. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is more problematic because she's making the relationship contingent on something that might not be a deal-breaker for the author. If the author is willing to walk away if the cat is part of the equation, that's his choice. But is he in the wrong? Maybe not. He's standing up for his boundaries. However, his approach of matching her ultimatum might not be the healthiest, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for having those feelings initially.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his genuine feelings and trying to communicate. The girlfriend's reaction is more extreme. However, the author could have tried more creative solutions. But given the information, he's not in the wrong for having his preferences.\n"
