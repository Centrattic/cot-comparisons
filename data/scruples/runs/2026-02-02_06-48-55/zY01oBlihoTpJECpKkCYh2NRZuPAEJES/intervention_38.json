I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. They have a dog they love, and they've had bad experiences with cats, like scratches and bites. They don't see the appeal of cats and find them annoying. Now, their girlfriend has a cat, and they're thinking about moving in together. The author doesn't want the cat to come, but the girlfriend is firm, saying it's a package deal and even holding up the relationship with an ultimatum. The author is considering matching her hardball approach by making her rehome the cat if she wants to move in.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons\u2014cats don't get along with their dog, they find cats annoying, and there's a history of negative interactions. It's their home, so they might have the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while, and it's part of her life. Maybe she's attached to it. The author is now in a position where they want to make a significant life decision (moving in together), which involves accommodating each other's needs. But the author is facing resistance because the girlfriend is not budging. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to talk about it, but the girlfriend responded with a cold, ultimatum-based reaction. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum. Is this fair? Well, if the girlfriend is not willing to compromise, maybe the author isn't wrong in setting their own boundary. However, using the threat of breaking up or rehoming the cat as a counter might be seen as equally extreme. But the original issue is about the author's comfort in their own home. They have a right to that, but they also need to respect their partner's attachment to the cat.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have brought this up earlier. Since they've been dating a year and are thinking about moving in, maybe they should have discussed pet policies sooner. But it's not clear when the cat came into the picture. Also, the girlfriend's response seems overly harsh by holding the relationship hostage. The author might not be in the wrong because they're standing up for their needs, especially regarding their living environment and their dog's well-being. But rehoming the cat is a big ask, and the author's ultimatum could be seen as equally harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have legitimate concerns. The girlfriend's response was extreme, so the author's pushback isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way they're handling it (playing hardball) could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether their reasons are reasonable and if they've tried to find a middle ground. Since the author has tried to discuss it and the girlfriend didn't budge, the author is not entirely at fault. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
