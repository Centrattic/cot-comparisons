I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He lists several reasons: cats don't show affection the way dogs do, they're hard to train, they scratch and bite, and he finds them annoying. He's tried discussing this with his girlfriend but she's taking it as an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend has a cat and seems very attached to it. She's given a clear response that the cat comes with her, and if that's a problem, maybe they shouldn't continue. The author is now considering using a hardball approach by saying she can't move in unless she rehomes the cat.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here involve mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. Relationships require both parties to make concessions. The author has valid feelings about cats, but he's also at a point where he's considering moving in together, which is a significant step. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She's not open to any discussion or alternative solutions, like keeping the cat elsewhere temporarily. The author's position is about his comfort and well-being, which is important too. \n\nBut relationships aren't just about personal preferences; they involve teamwork. The author is in a tough spot because his preferences might be conflicting with his partner's needs. However, suggesting an ultimatum where the cat has to go might be hurtful, but so is the girlfriend's ultimatum about staying together or breaking up. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having strong preferences. However, his proposed response (playing hardball) could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. The girlfriend's inflexibility might also be a problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both need to find a middle ground. The author's stance is about his home environment and living with someone's pet. Since pets are part of people's lives, it's a common issue. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Given that he's been in the relationship for a year and is serious about marriage, it's a significant decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to set boundaries for his own comfort. The girlfriend's response is more problematic because she's not considering alternatives. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
