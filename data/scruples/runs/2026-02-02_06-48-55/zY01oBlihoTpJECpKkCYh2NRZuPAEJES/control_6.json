I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has a strong dislike for cats. He's had negative experiences with them, like scratches and bites. He's in a relationship where the girlfriend has a cat. They're considering moving in together, and he doesn't want the cat to come. He tried talking to her, but she's firm, even to the point of giving an ultimatum.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether his stance is reasonable. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid personal preferences. He's been clear about his dislike for cats, which is affecting his comfort. If they move in together, he's going to live with this cat daily. It's reasonable for him to express that he doesn't want to. Also, the girlfriend's response seems extreme\u2014holding the relationship hostage over the cat. That's a big deal because it's about the future of their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has her own attachment to her cat. She's had the cat for a while, and it's part of her life. The author is asking her to rehome the cat, which is a significant request. Maybe she's not willing to do that because of her bond with the pet. It's possible she feels that her needs are equally important.\n\nBut the key points here are: the author has tried discussing it calmly, the girlfriend is being inflexible, and she's turned it into an ultimatum. The author is caught between his preferences and her demands. The question is whether he's wrong for standing his ground. If she's not open to compromise and is using the relationship as leverage, maybe the author isn't wrong for setting his own boundaries. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If she's not willing to find a middle ground, then expecting the author to give up his stance might be unreasonable. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
