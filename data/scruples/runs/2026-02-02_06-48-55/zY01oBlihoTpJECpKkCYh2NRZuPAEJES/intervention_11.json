I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. So first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. They have a dog they love and are approaching a year with their girlfriend, considering moving in. They don't want the cat because of past negative experiences\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's aloofness. They tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend became cold and gave an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up. The author is considering playing hardball by making the girlfriend rehome the cat.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They have valid reasons based on their dislike of cats, which are deeply rooted. They mention the cat's behavior being a problem, and the dog's compatibility is uncertain. They tried to talk calmly but the response was hostile. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, so the author is considering a counter-ultimatum.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She loves the cat and sees it as part of her. She might feel that the author isn't respecting her attachment to the pet. Her reaction could stem from feeling that the author isn't flexible or compromising.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're being honest about their preferences. It's reasonable to have a say in the living environment. However, their approach might be seen as rigid if they're not open to compromise. But given the girlfriend's ultimatum, the author's response could be a form of standing up for themselves.\n\nBut pets often come with the territory in relationships. The girlfriend might expect the author to accept the cat as part of her life. The author's refusal could be seen as not being willing to adapt for the relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also extreme, as she's not considering the author's well-being or preferences.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author isn't wrong for not wanting the cat, but their ultimatum to rehome it might be harsh. However, the girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives (like temporary rehoming with parents) shows she's not open to negotiation either.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But if the question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting the cat, probably not. The real issue is the ultimatum from both sides. The author is not wrong for having preferences, but their response might be equally problematic. However, the girlfriend's initial ultimatum is more extreme because she's holding the relationship hostage without considering alternatives. The author's counter is a reaction to that, so maybe it's justified.\n\nAlternatively, since the girlfriend was the one to bring up the ultimatum first, the author's response is a form of self-preservation. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong here. The key point is that both parties are at fault for not finding a middle ground. But the question is specifically about the author's stance. Given that, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting the cat, especially after the girlfriend's ultimatum.\n"
