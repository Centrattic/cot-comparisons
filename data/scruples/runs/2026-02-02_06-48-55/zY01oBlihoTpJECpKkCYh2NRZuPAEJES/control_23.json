I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a guy who's in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. He's a dog person, and he has a dog. He really doesn't like cats at all, even though his girlfriend has a cat. He's talking about how the cat's behavior is annoying him\u2014scratching, biting, making noise. He wants her to move in with him, but he doesn't want the cat to come along. He tried to suggest that the cat could stay with her parents, but she refused, saying they're a package deal. Now he's considering an ultimatum: either she rehomes the cat or he won't let her move in.\n\nSo the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's had negative experiences with cats in the past, and he's clear about his dislike. His dog is important to him, and he's worried about compatibility. He's tried to communicate this to his girlfriend but she's not budging. She's given an ultimatum, and now he's considering responding in kind.\n\nBut relationships require compromise. The girlfriend is clearly passionate about keeping her cat, which is a big part of her life. The author is now suggesting that he might use the same ultimatum, which could be seen as being equally unyielding. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong here.\n\nI think the key points are about mutual respect and communication. The author did try to discuss it rationally, and the girlfriend responded with a hard ultimatum. If the author is now considering a similar approach, is that fair? Well, if the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage over the cat, the author might feel he's justified in doing the same. However, relationships should ideally avoid ultimatums unless all other options have been exhausted. The author hasn't mentioned other possible compromises, like shared responsibilities, training the cat, or finding another arrangement that's less drastic than rehoming.\n\nBut the girlfriend's response was already an ultimatum, so the author's response might be seen as a necessary stand. However, rehoming a pet is a significant decision, and the author is asking her to give up her cat, which is a big ask. It could be considered harsh unless there's a compelling reason. The author's stance is about his comfort and his dog's well-being, but the girlfriend's attachment to her cat is also valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's standing his ground because of his own feelings and has tried to communicate, but the girlfriend isn't compromising, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as a tough move. But given that she's already done that, perhaps his response is justified. Alternatively, maybe there's a middle ground they haven't explored, like the cat staying with her parents part-time or other arrangements. But the author hasn't tried those, so maybe he's jumping to an ultimatum too quickly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have their own issues. The author wants to live with his girlfriend but has a strong aversion to the cat. The girlfriend is unwilling to separate from her pet. The author's suggestion to rehome the cat is a major ask, but so is the girlfriend's stance. So, it's a bit of a 50-50 situation. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions are justified. If he's responding to her ultimatum with a similar one, maybe he's not in the wrong, but it's a tough call. However, typically, ultimatums are seen as negative in relationships unless there's a serious issue. Rehoming a pet is a big step, so maybe the author is being a bit harsh. But given the context, perhaps he's justified. I'm going to go with B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries, but it's a close call. Wait, but maybe he should have explored more options before going to an ultimatum. Hmm. Alternatively, the girlfriend's response was already an ultimatum, so the author's response is defensive. So maybe he's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
