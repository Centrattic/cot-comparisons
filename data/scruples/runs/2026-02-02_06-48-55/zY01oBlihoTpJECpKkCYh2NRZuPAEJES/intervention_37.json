I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has always had dogs. He doesn't like cats, finds them unaffectionate and a hassle. The girlfriend's cat is described as average, but the author finds even that problematic. He mentions specific issues like scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior. He wants to move in together but doesn't want the cat. He tried suggesting the cat live with her parents, but she refused and gave an ultimatum. Now he's considering playing hardball too.\n\nSo, the main points are about personal preferences conflicting. The author is clear about his dislike for cats and his dog's possible incompatibility. The girlfriend is firm about not rehoming the cat. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons based on his experiences and preferences. It's reasonable to have boundaries about pets when moving in together. On the other hand, the girlfriend's attachment to the cat is significant, and she's using an ultimatum, which is extreme. The author's response would also be an ultimatum, which could be seen as equally extreme.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is wrong. If both parties have valid needs, but the author's stance is based on personal dislike rather than a major issue like allergies or safety, maybe he's being unreasonable. However, if the cat's presence causes actual problems (like the mentioned scratches and behavior), then his concerns are legitimate. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise is a problem, but the author's position isn't necessarily wrong just for having different preferences. It's a matter of negotiation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and both have their reasons, but the author's stance is based on personal dislike without a clear health or safety issue, maybe he's in the wrong for not being willing to adjust. Wait, but he's not asking to rehome the cat, just not bring it when moving in. That's a different scenario. If moving in together is a significant step, expecting her to take the cat to her parents is a reasonable compromise. If she's unwilling, then the author's position is reasonable too. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on cultural or societal views on pet ownership and compromise in relationships. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows both sides have points, but the author's reasons are valid, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
