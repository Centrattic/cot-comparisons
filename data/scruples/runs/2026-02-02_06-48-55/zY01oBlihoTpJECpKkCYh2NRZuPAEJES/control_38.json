I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a dog person and has a dog. He doesn't like cats and lists various reasons: cats are aloof, take a lot of training, scratch and bite, and cause him stress. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want it to move in with them. When he tried to discuss it, she became cold and gave an ultimatum about either taking the cat or breaking up. Now he's considering using a hardball approach by making her rehome the cat before moving in.\n\nThe question is if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nHe's expressing his preferences and concerns. He's not being unreasonable. He has valid reasons based on his dislike for cats and the potential conflict with his dog. The girlfriend, however, is being rigid and not compromising. The ultimatum she gave is extreme. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. If one person is unwilling to budge, it can lead to problems. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is reasonable. Her reaction seems harsh. The author considering a counter-ultimatum is a response to her hardline stance. \n\nBut is that in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for his own boundaries. It's his home, and he's allowed to have preferences about pets. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014playing hardball\u2014might be seen as equally ultimatum-like, which could be problematic. \n\nBut the original question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction was the immediate trigger, but the author's stance is based on his genuine dislike for cats. Since relationships require mutual respect and negotiation, perhaps neither is entirely right or wrong. However, since the girlfriend's response was to hold the relationship hostage, the author isn't necessarily at fault for defending his position. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for having his preferences and trying to discuss them, especially when the other party isn't being reasonable.\n"
