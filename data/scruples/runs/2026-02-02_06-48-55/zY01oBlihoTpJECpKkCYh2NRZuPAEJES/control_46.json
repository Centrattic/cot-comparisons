I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and has strong feelings against cats. He's had bad experiences with them, like scratches and bites, and finds them unmanageable. He mentions that his girlfriend is amazing, but the cat is causing him a lot of stress. He's even thought about their future marriage, which shows he's serious about the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is a cat person. She loves the cat and is treating it as part of the package. Her response was firm, even an ultimatum, which complicates things. The author is trying to communicate his needs, but she's not budging. \n\nNow, the key points here are mutual respect and compromise. In any relationship, both partners need to make some concessions. The author's position is about his well-being and living environment. He's not just being petty; he has valid reasons based on his experiences. However, the girlfriend is also standing her ground about her pet, which she obviously cares deeply about.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. If he's expressed his concerns calmly and rationally, and she's responded with a hard ultimatum, it's not necessarily his fault to want the cat out. But moving in together is a big step, and expecting her to rehome the cat might be a significant ask. However, if the cat is causing him real distress and affecting their future together, he's within his right to set boundaries.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe finding a solution like keeping the cat in a specific area or using training methods. But the author mentions that the cat is already problematic, and he's tried talking to her without success. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues that affect daily life. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting the cat. His health and comfort matter. The girlfriend's ultimatum is a problem because it's a take-it-or-leave-it approach without compromise. However, the author is now considering a hardball response, which could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs, and pets are a common point of contention in relationships. The key is whether both parties can compromise, but if she's unwilling, he's justified in setting his boundaries.\n"
