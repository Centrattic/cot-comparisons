I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's an asshole move for the author to not want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He's been with his girlfriend for almost a year and is considering marriage. He doesn't want the cat to come live with them because of his dislike for cats, and when he's tried to discuss it, she's been very firm, even holding the relationship hostage. Now he's considering taking a hard line by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed.\n\nThe key points here are the author's legitimate reasons for disliking cats and the girlfriend's ultimatum. The author's reasons are based on personal preference and past experiences with cats causing him scratches and bites. His desire to have a harmonious living situation with his girlfriend is understandable, especially if he's planning to marry her. On the other hand, the girlfriend's attachment to her cat is also valid because she loves the animal and sees it as part of her life.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if the author's stance is unreasonable or if he's justified in his position.\n\nThe author is presenting his case as someone who has made a reasonable effort to discuss the issue calmly but was met with an ultimatum. He's not asking for the cat to be rehomed immediately, just that when they move in together, the cat doesn't come. This seems like a reasonable request, especially if they're planning a shared future. The girlfriend, however, is treating the cat as non-negotiable, which could be seen as putting the cat's needs above the relationship's future. \n\nBut pets are often seen as family by their owners, so her strong reaction might be because the cat is a significant part of her life. However, the author has his own preferences and concerns about cohabitation. If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise at all, that might indicate a lack of willingness to find a middle ground. The author's considering playing hardball could be a response to her ultimatum. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to avoid living with a cat he dislikes. His stance is based on personal experience and the desire for a comfortable shared home. The girlfriend's stance is based on her love for her pet. However, relationships require compromise. If the author is willing to find a solution (like the parents' idea), but the girlfriend isn't, that's a problem on her end. \n\nSo, the author's position might not be in the wrong, especially if he's made reasonable suggestions. The girlfriend's ultimatum complicates things, but the author's desire to set boundaries is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
