I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether he should let his girlfriend bring her cat when they move in together. He's a dog person, doesn't like cats, and the cat has some behaviors that annoy him, like scratching, biting, and climbing around. He's considering not letting the cat come and even threatening to break up if she insists. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He mentions that the cat's behavior causes him discomfort and stress. He's been with his girlfriend almost a year and is thinking long-term. On the other hand, his girlfriend clearly loves her cat and is firm about keeping it with her. Her response is quite harsh, giving an ultimatum that either both the cat and she move in, or they break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. Relationships require compromise. If the author is willing to let his girlfriend move in but not the cat, is that a reasonable compromise? However, his approach is to essentially say if she can't rehome the cat, they can't move in together. That sounds like a strong stance. But maybe it's fair because it's a significant decision affecting their shared living space. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend's ultimatum is also a hardball approach. She's not open to discussion or solutions. The author tried to talk it out, but she reacted coldly. That's a red flag for communication issues. If she's not willing to consider other options, like rehoming the cat temporarily or finding a solution that works for both, it might be a problem.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he can't stand cats, and the cat's presence is a dealbreaker for him. If this is a fundamental incompatibility, like someone's deeply held values or significant allergies, it's more of a personal right. However, here it's more about preference. The cat isn't problematic in itself, just that the author doesn't get along with it. So maybe it's not about the cat's behavior but his own aversion. That could be a personal choice, but in a relationship, certain preferences might need to be addressed. \n\nHowever, if the girlfriend is unwilling to even consider moving the cat to her parents' place temporarily, which the author suggested, and she's holding the relationship hostage, that's a problem. The author is trying to find a solution (moving the cat to her parents) but she refuses. So he's being reasonable in his request but she's not. \n\nBut is it wrong to expect a partner to be considerate of your deeply held feelings? The author doesn't hate the cat, but he really can't stand it. If the cat's presence is causing him so much stress that he can't imagine living with it, that's a legitimate concern. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be the issue here. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong if he's making a reasonable request to not have the cat in their shared living space. His girlfriend's ultimatum is more extreme, so the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B, No.\n"
