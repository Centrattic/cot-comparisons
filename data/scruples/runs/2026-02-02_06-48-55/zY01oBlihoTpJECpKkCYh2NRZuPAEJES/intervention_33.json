I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether he should allow his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. He's a dog person and really doesn't like cats, which causes some tension.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been with him for almost a year and they're talking about moving in together. He's clear about his dislike for cats, even giving specific examples of how the cat behaves when they hang out. He's tried to discuss it, but she's been very firm, even to the point of an ultimatum. Now he's considering using a hardball approach to make her rehome the cat, and he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors. Compatibility in relationships often involves compromise. The author has a strong aversion to cats, which he's had for a long time. On the other hand, the cat has been part of his girlfriend's life, and she's attached to it. Moving in together is a big step, so both should consider each other's needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is pretty extreme. But she might feel that the cat is part of her life and she can't give it up. However, the author is also standing his ground. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since he's been clear about his dislike for cats and the cat's behavior is problematic for him, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary. \n\nBut relationships require flexibility. If the author is unwilling to find a middle ground, like setting up a specific area for the cat or training it, he might come off as inflexible. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also a problem because she's not willing to negotiate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to set this boundary. He's not trying to harm her relationship with the cat, just to protect his own comfort and the environment in their shared home. If he's willing to propose solutions (like the parents' place) but she's not accepting them, then his position might be reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, if there's a way to accommodate both needs, but the author is taking a hardline approach, that could be seen as the issue. But given the examples he gives (the cat's behavior being a problem, the girlfriend's unwillingness to compromise), maybe he's justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. His feelings are valid, and he's trying to maintain his own happiness in the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is more problematic because she's being inflexible. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
