I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nThe author is a dog person and has a strong aversion to cats. He lists specific issues: the cat's behavior like scratching, biting, and noise. He's also concerned about the dog getting along with the cat. He's proposed solutions like the cat living with her parents, but she's refused, leading to an ultimatum from her. The author is now considering playing hardball.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if his reasons are valid. Not liking cats isn't unreasonable. People have different preferences. The cat isn't described as problematic beyond typical cat behavior. However, the author's dislike seems intense, which might affect cohabitation. But is it a deal-breaker? Relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives, maybe the author should evaluate if they can live together given the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is firm. She sees the cat as part of her life and is using an ultimatum. The author's response would be to not move in until the cat is rehomed. Is that fair? Well, if she's not willing to compromise, the author is trying to set a boundary. However, the author also needs to consider if his stance is equally non-negotiable. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's reasons are legitimate. Disliking cats is personal, but if the cat's presence causes significant issues that affect their living environment, it's a valid concern. However, the author's approach might come across as dismissive of her feelings towards the cat, especially if he hasn't explored all possible solutions. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives is also problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties need to compromise. The author's ultimatum might be seen as a reasonable response if he's made clear his non-negotiable points. But if the cat's presence is causing real problems (like health issues, allergies, or safety), that's different. Here, it's more about personal dislike and behavior issues. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe he could explore more compromises. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also extreme. \n\nGiven that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His preferences are valid, and if she's not willing to adjust, he's justified in standing his ground. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
