I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and has strongly negative feelings towards cats. He's had bad experiences with scratches and bites, and finds cats annoying. He's even mentioned that the cat's behavior is bothering him. He's thought about the future, possibly marriage, and wants her to move in but doesn't want the cat. He tried to discuss it, but his girlfriend was firm, even giving an ultimatum. Now he's considering playing hardball by refusing unless the cat is rehomed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her pet. She's had the cat for a while, and it's part of her life. Her response was pretty harsh, but maybe she's attached to the cat. The author is now contemplating an ultimatum in return. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to communicate his needs, which is reasonable. However, his solution is to hold the relationship hostage unless the cat is rehomed. That's a bit extreme, especially since the girlfriend has already given an ultimatum. But maybe he's justified because he's standing up for his own boundaries. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend was \"stone cold\" and gave an ultimatum suggests she might be overreacting. But the author's approach of a counter-ultimatum could be seen as equally harsh. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his stance is a reasonable boundary or an overreaction. Since he's clear about his feelings and the cat's impact on his well-being, it's a bit of a gray area. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as inconsiderate, even if he's not wrong about his feelings. The question is whether his actions (playing hardball) make him the asshole. \n\nI think the answer could be A or B, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his needs, but the way he's handling it is questionable. However, the original question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his actions are ideal. Since he's not the one who first gave an ultimatum, but is responding to it, maybe he's justified. Hmm. Maybe B is correct here.\n"
