I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a dog person who doesn't like cats and doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them when they get a place together. His girlfriend is taking it very seriously, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting a cat. He mentions scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior being annoying. He's been clear about his feelings towards cats, and it's affecting their potential living situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and sees it as part of her life. She's not willing to part with it, which is understandable because pets are part of people's lives and emotions.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to suggest alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents, but she refused. She's given an ultimatum, which is a strong move. The author is now considering playing hardball too. The question is whether he's in the wrong for standing his ground.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both partners need to make adjustments. But if one partner's core values or well-being are being compromised, it's a problem. The author doesn't hate cats in general but has strong negative feelings towards their care and the specific issues with this cat. If the cat is causing ongoing stress and the girlfriend isn't willing to find a solution, then the author's stance might be justified. However, refusing to compromise could also be seen as selfish. \n\nBut considering that the author has made his feelings clear and the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, maybe the author isn't wrong. Relationships require mutual compromise. If one partner isn't willing to negotiate on something important to the other, it's a red flag. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme. However, the author is also taking a firm stance, which could be seen as equally harsh. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings and the impact the cat has on him. His request is reasonable if the cat's presence would cause ongoing conflict. But the girlfriend's reaction is problematic because she's not open to alternatives. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
