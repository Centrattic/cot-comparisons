I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the guy doesn't like cats, and his girlfriend has a cat. They're getting serious and he doesn't want the cat to move in with them. The girlfriend is giving an ultimatum: the cat comes with her or it's breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he's a dog person, has had dogs all his life, and really doesn't like cats. He finds them aloof, hard to train, and they've scratched or bitten him. He's even described the cat's behavior as annoying, like jumping on him, stepping on his crotch, and yowling. He wants the girlfriend to move in, but not with the cat. He tried to discuss it and she was unyielding, even giving an ultimatum. Now he's considering an ultimatum himself.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but is that accurate?\n\nWell, let's consider the key points. The author is being honest about his discomfort with cats. He's communicated his feelings to his girlfriend. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is steadfast. But she's holding the relationship hostage by saying the cat is non-negotiable. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The girlfriend might see the cat as part of her life, which is valid. However, the author is not unreasonable in his request\u2014cats can be challenging for some people, and having a pet that causes stress isn't ideal. But does that make him in the wrong? If he's communicated his feelings and tried to find a solution (like the parents taking the cat), but she's unwilling to budge, perhaps the issue is more on her side. \n\nBut pets can be a significant part of someone's life. The girlfriend might feel that the cat is family, and giving it up would be hard. However, the author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her emotional attachment. On the other hand, if the cat is causing him physical discomfort and stress, that's a legitimate concern. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But maybe the girlfriend's ultimatum is the problem here. The author is trying to set a boundary for his own well-being. If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, maybe the fault isn't entirely on him. \n\nHowever, the way the author frames his dislike of cats is a bit strong\u2014calling them animals that don't care if you live or die, and comparing them to someone you hate. That might come off as harsh and could be part of why the girlfriend is defensive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But if the author is being unreasonable in his stance, he might be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, maybe she's the one in the wrong. The author is not the one holding the cat as a non-negotiable; the girlfriend is. So if the author is standing up for his needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the user thinks he is. Maybe the author should have tried more to understand her perspective or found a middle ground. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. His stance is about his personal comfort and safety, which is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
