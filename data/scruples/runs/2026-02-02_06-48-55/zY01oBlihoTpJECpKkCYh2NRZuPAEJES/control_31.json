I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it's an asshole move to not want his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. He's a dog person and doesn't like cats, finds them annoying, and has issues with the cat's behavior. He's tried talking to her, but she's not budging and even made an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's had bad experiences, doesn't get along with cats, and is concerned about his dog's compatibility. His feelings are real, and it's his home. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while, loves it, and sees them as a package deal. Her reaction is strong, even hostile, which might be an overreaction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting this boundary. People have different preferences when it comes to pets. It's reasonable for him to not want a pet he dislikes in his home. But does that make him an asshole? Maybe not. It's about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the girl's response is extreme. Using an ultimatum like breaking up if he doesn't accept the cat is a red flag. But the author is also being firm. The key is whether his stance is reasonable. Since he's clear about his feelings and tried to discuss it, he's not wrong for standing his ground. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be the bigger issue, but the question is about the author's wrongness. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's setting a personal boundary, and it's his right to have his preferences respected in his own home.\n"
