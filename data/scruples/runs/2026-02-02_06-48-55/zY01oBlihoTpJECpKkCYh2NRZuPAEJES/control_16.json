I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author has a strong dislike for cats, which seems to be affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons\u2014personal dislike, past experiences with cats, and concerns about their dog interacting with the cat. They tried to discuss it calmly, but the girlfriend reacted negatively, even holding the relationship hostage with an ultimatum. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life. She might see the cat as a family member, so her reaction could be about not wanting to give it up. The author's request is about their own comfort and future living situation, which is reasonable. However, demanding that the girlfriend rehome the cat is a tough stance, which could be seen as ultimatum-like, similar to how the girlfriend reacted.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The problem started with the girlfriend's ultimatum, which was harsh. The author's response might be a reaction to that. But is it fair to say the author is wrong for setting boundaries? They are entitled to their preferences. However, demanding rehoming the cat could hurt the relationship. But given the girlfriend's reaction, the author might feel justified. \n\nAlso, the author tried to compromise, suggesting the cat live with her parents, but she refused. So the author's stance is about maintaining their own standards for their home. Whether that's reasonable depends on mutual respect. The girlfriend's response was extreme, so the author's pushback isn't necessarily wrong. They're standing up for their own needs. So the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the girlfriend was the one who made the ultimatum first, the author's response is a reaction to that. So maybe B is correct.\n"
