I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person who doesn't like cats and has specific reasons for disliking them, including past negative experiences. The girlfriend is very attached to her cat and is unwilling to part with it, even to the point of threatening the relationship if the cat can't stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the cat causes them discomfort, allergies (maybe?), and conflict with their own dog. They want to maintain a harmonious living environment. On the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to separate from it. The author is now at a crossroads where they have to decide whether to compromise or risk the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss the issue but the girlfriend was inflexible. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting the cat. In relationships, it's common for both partners to need to make sacrifices. However, the girlfriend's response seems extreme by making it a deal-breaker. If the author feels that having the cat in their home would significantly impact their well-being and the relationship is now being held hostage, then the author's stance might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider if there are alternative solutions, like the cat staying at the girlfriend's parents' house, even if it's in the same city. The author suggests this, but the girlfriend refuses. The author is now contemplating an ultimatum in return. Whether this is a justifiable move depends on the balance of compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to budge on a significant issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground, especially if the cat's presence causes them real issues.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration and the girlfriend's ultimatum are both contributing factors. The author's position isn't inherently wrong because personal boundaries in a relationship are important. But the author should also reflect on whether they've explored all possible compromises. If all avenues have been exhausted and the girlfriend is unwilling to meet halfway, then the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. Still, the way the author is considering responding (play hardball) could be seen as equally extreme. The answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong by pushing back.\n"
