I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person who has strong dislikes towards cats. He's given specific reasons like the cat's behavior (scratching, biting, noise) and his incompatibility with cats. He's tried to discuss it calmly but the girlfriend is resolute, even using an ultimatum. The author is contemplating a hardball approach by refusing to let her move in unless she rehomes the cat.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and is attached to it. The cat isn't described as aggressive or problematic beyond typical cat behavior. Her response seems firm, maybe even a bit harsh with the breakup ultimatum, but she's defending her pet. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has expressed his concerns, but the girlfriend isn't budging. However, the author's proposed solution (forcing her to rehome the cat) is a significant demand. Relationships require compromise, and it's possible the author is overstepping by making this a deal-breaker. On the other hand, his discomfort is real and he's made his stance clear. \n\nBut relationships also involve meeting halfway. If the author is unwilling to consider alternatives (like cat-proofing the home, training, or adjusting his expectations), he might be the one being inflexible. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's response could be equally harsh. \n\nIn such cases, the balance of who's being more unreasonable matters. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise might be problematic, but the author's suggestion to play hardball by demanding the cat's removal isn't without fault. It depends on whether the author is being reasonable in his demands. Since he's not showing willingness to find a middle ground, he might be in the wrong. However, his personal discomfort is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not open to solutions and is suggesting a harsh reaction. But there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the cat's presence is genuinely affecting his well-being, it's a valid concern. The answer isn't straightforward, but given the ultimatum from both sides, the author's approach could be seen as equally harsh, making him at fault. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
