I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author clearly states his dislike for cats, explaining why he finds them annoying and difficult. He's a dog person and has issues with the cat's behavior. The girlfriend is firm about the cat coming with her when she moves in, even to the point of giving an ultimatum.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is in a committed relationship, thinking about marriage and moving in. His main concern is about cohabitation with a pet he doesn't like. The girlfriend's response is harsh, making it an all-or-nothing situation. The author is contemplating whether it's an asshole move to push back by demanding the cat be rehomed.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for his dislike. It's his home, and he should feel comfortable. On the other hand, the girlfriend's attachment to her cat is significant, and she's not willing to compromise. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort over her cat's presence.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and compromise. Relationships require both parties to make concessions. The author tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend didn't engage constructively. However, the author is now considering a hardball approach, which could be seen as equally ultimatum-like. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend already gave an ultimatum. If the author responds with his own, is he just mirroring her behavior? That might not be the healthiest approach. But given her refusal to budge, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, the problem might be that the author is not considering other solutions. Maybe they could find a middle ground, like having the cat in a specific area or temporary arrangements. But the author's stance is that even an average cat is unbearable for him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting to live comfortably, but holding the cat as a deal-breaker might be extreme. Conversely, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also harsh. \n\nGiven the scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting his preferences respected. But using a hardball approach might not be the best way. The answer might hinge on whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since he's not the one with the initial ultimatum, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
