I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person and has issues with the cat's behavior. They tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend became unyielding, even giving an ultimatum. The author is considering a hardball approach, which is the crux of the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities in a relationship. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat\u2014personal dislike, past negative experiences, and concerns about their dog's compatibility. However, the girlfriend is firm in her stance that she can't leave the cat behind. The key here is whether the author's refusal is a reasonable request or if it's being used to avoid compromise.\n\nOn one hand, pets are part of a person's life, and moving in together usually involves some adjustments. The author is asking the girlfriend to rehome the cat, which is a significant request. But the girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, which is not healthy in a relationship. However, the author's own hardball approach might also be problematic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The initial post presents the author's perspective, but maybe they should have explored other solutions first. The girlfriend is in the same city, so maybe the cat could stay with her parents or another relative temporarily. Alternatively, perhaps the couple could find a middle ground, like keeping the cat in certain areas of the apartment and working on training. The author's response to the girlfriend's ultimatum with a similar stance could be seen as an asshole move because it's a direct counter-ultimatum without considering alternatives. \n\nHowever, if the cat's presence is causing actual harm or severe discomfort to the author, and there's no compromise, then maybe the author has a valid point. But the situation seems more about personal preference rather than a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's potential response is equally so. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being inflexible, given that the cat isn't a significant problem in terms of behavior, just the author's dislike. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since the cat is described as average and the author's issues are personal aversion, not health or safety concerns, the author might be in the wrong for not being willing to make a compromise. The girlfriend's response is harsh, but the author's consideration of an ultimatum is also not ideal. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the post is asking if they're the asshole, and the girlfriend is the one who gave the ultimatum first, the author's response could be seen as equally bad. But maybe the author's position is not entirely wrong because they have a valid right to have a living environment that suits them. \n\nWait, but the author already tried to suggest the cat stay with her parents, which was rejected. They might have done what they could. The girlfriend's ultimatum is the problem, but the author is now considering their own. The answer could be B (author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their preferences. However, maybe the author is in the wrong for putting the girlfriend into a position where she has to rehome the cat, which is a big decision. The real issue is about mutual respect and compromise. If the author is unwilling to accommodate the cat, which is part of the girlfriend's life, even if it's not a perfect solution, that could be problematic. So maybe A (author is in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
