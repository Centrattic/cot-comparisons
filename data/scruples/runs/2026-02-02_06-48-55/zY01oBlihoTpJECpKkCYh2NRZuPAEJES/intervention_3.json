I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they don't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and really dislikes cats. They've had some negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites, and find cats difficult to deal with. The girlfriend is a cat person and is firm about not giving up the cat, even suggesting an ultimatum about moving in together or breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that cats are a problem for them personally\u2014scratchy, unresponsive, and they don't get along. They love their dog and want their future home to be compatible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves her cat and isn't willing to part with it, which is a significant part of her life. She's given a clear ultimatum, which adds pressure to the situation.\n\nI should evaluate if the author's decision is reasonable. It's their home, so they have a right to set boundaries. However, the girlfriend has a right to her pet as well. The author is trying to make a compromise by suggesting the cat could live with her parents. But she refuses, leading to a standoff. \n\nThe author is now considering playing hardball by not letting the cat come, which could be seen as a counter-ultimatum. The key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the cat is a significant part of the girlfriend's life, maybe the author should try more negotiation or find a middle ground, like a trial period with the cat, or finding a way to make the living situation work for both. However, the author has valid concerns about their own well-being and comfort. \n\nBut the girlfriend's refusal to compromise and her ultimatum might also be problematic. The question is whether the author's position is fair. Since the author is not the one with the cat, they might have the upper hand in this situation. But maybe the author could have approached the conversation differently. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't wrong for having personal preferences, but the girlfriend's unwillingness to negotiate could be an issue. However, the author is now considering an ultimatum as well, which might be seen as equally harsh. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their preferences. However, the way they handle it might need more consideration. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given the girlfriend's rigid stance, the author's position could be justified. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
