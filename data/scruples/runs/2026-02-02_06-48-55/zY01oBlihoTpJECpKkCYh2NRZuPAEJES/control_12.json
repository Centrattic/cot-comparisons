I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a dog person who really doesn't like cats, and his girlfriend wants to bring her cat when they move in together. He's trying to figure out if it's an asshole move (AITA) to not allow the cat into their home and even suggest rehoming it if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a strong dislike for cats, which he explains in detail\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior, etc. He's been in a relationship for almost a year, and they're planning to move in. The girlfriend is firm about the cat coming with her, even saying they're a package deal. She turned cold when he suggested alternatives like the cat living with her parents. He felt she's holding the relationship hostage with an ultimatum, which is a big deal.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, relationships require compromise. Both parties have to make sacrifices for each other. However, the author is also clear that this is a significant issue for him. Living with a cat could cause ongoing stress and discomfort. The girlfriend's response seems pretty extreme, giving an ultimatum without flexibility. \n\nBut does that make the author right to respond with his own ultimatum? If both are holding firm on non-negotiables, it might indicate that they're not compatible in some key area. The author isn't trying to be difficult just for the sake of it; he has genuine reasons. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) might be the problem here. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't asking for the cat to be killed or abandoned; he's suggesting rehoming. But rehoming a pet isn't a trivial decision. It can be stressful for the pet and the owner. However, the girlfriend's stance seems to prioritize the cat's presence over the author's well-being, which could be a sign of imbalance in the relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since he's made his feelings clear and tried to find a solution (like the cat living with her parents), and she's unwilling to budge, maybe he's not in the wrong. Relationships need mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If she's not willing to respect his dislike of cats, then his decision to set this boundary is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the emotional attachment his girlfriend has to the cat. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to get rid of the cat, just not allowing it into their shared home, and he's given alternatives, it's more about setting limits. The girlfriend's ultimatum is more direct, which might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). He's standing by his personal boundaries, and the girlfriend's inflexible response is the problem. If she's not willing to compromise, then the author's stance is justified.\n"
