I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and his girlfriend over whether the cat can move in with them. The author is a dog person who strongly dislikes cats and doesn't want the cat to live with them when they move in. The girlfriend is a cat person and seems to view the cat as part of the package, even to the point of threatening to break up if he doesn't accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the rights and wrongs here. The author's main issue is his dislike of cats, which is a personal preference. He's clear that he doesn't want the cat in his home, which is understandable given his past experiences and strong feelings. However, the girlfriend is equally clear that she's not willing to part with the cat, and she's using a hard ultimatum. \n\nThe key points to consider are: \n\n1. **Respect for each other's preferences**: Relationships require compromise. The author is trying to communicate a significant boundary about his living space. On the other hand, the girlfriend is also asserting her attachment to the cat. \n\n2. **Communication and compromise**: The author tried to discuss alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents. The girlfriend rejected this, leading to a stalemate. The author's proposal of a \"package deal\" is a firm stance, but is it reasonable?\n\n3. **Ultimatums and leverage**: The girlfriend's ultimatum is a strong move, suggesting that the cat is non-negotiable. The author is considering responding with a hardball approach as well. \n\n4. **Negotiation attempts**: The author did try to approach the situation calmly and rationally, which is a good sign. The girlfriend's response being \"stone cold\" might indicate that she's not open to negotiation, which complicates matters.\n\n5. **Future planning**: The author is considering moving in together and sees the cat issue as a barrier to that. The girlfriend's stance may be based on her love for the cat, but the author's stance is about his personal comfort and living environment.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives, maybe the author is justified in standing firm. However, is refusing to accommodate a pet that the partner deeply cares about a fair thing to do? It could be seen as not compromising, especially if the cat isn't a danger or health issue. The author's dislike is personal, but so is the girlfriend's attachment to her cat. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's ultimatum is also extreme. If the author's main issue is the cat's presence in his home, maybe there are other compromises they could explore (like the cat staying elsewhere part-time). But if she's not open to that, then the author might be right to hold his ground. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Since personal preferences about pets are common in relationships, and both parties have valid perspectives, it's a matter of whether the author's stance is unfair. The girlfriend's threat to break up over this is also a significant factor. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often criticized for ultimatums or for being inflexible. The girlfriend's hard ultimatum could be seen as the more extreme action, but the author's refusal to accept the cat might also be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for not accommodating the cat. If the cat isn't causing harm beyond personal dislike, the author's position might be seen as reasonable, especially since he's communicated his stance early. However, if the cat is a significant part of the girlfriend's life and she's unwilling to budge, the author might be expected to find a middle ground. \n\nGiven that the author tried to suggest alternatives and the girlfriend rejected them, and given that the author's objection is based on personal preference rather than objective issues (like allergies or safety), it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the solution is to separate the cat from the girlfriend, that could be a problem for her. \n\nOverall, I think the answer is B (No), because the author has a right to set boundaries about his home. However, the way he's considering playing hardball might be an issue, but the main question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat. Since he's communicated his stance and the girlfriend is the one refusing to compromise, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
