I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting the girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and has specific issues with cats, like the cat's behavior and their own negative experiences. They mention trying to talk to the girlfriend about it, but she's not budging and even gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's concerns about the cat's behavior and their dislike of cats is valid. However, the girlfriend has loved the cat and the author is now in a long-term relationship. The decision to move in together is a big step, so the author's right to set boundaries is understandable.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Throwing an ultimatum like breaking up if the cat isn't allowed is a red flag. It shows she's not open to compromise, which is important in a relationship. The author tried to find a solution (like the cat staying with her parents) but she refused. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. He's not asking to get rid of the cat entirely but just not have it in their shared home. The girlfriend, however, is holding the relationship hostage over the cat, which could indicate a lack of willingness to find a middle ground. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make compromises. If one person is unwilling to budge on a significant issue, it might be a sign of deeper problems. The author is trying to communicate his needs, and the girlfriend's response is all-or-nothing. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing his ground. He's trying to maintain his living situation and comfort, which are valid considerations.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the conversation differently or given more time for compromise. But given her ultimatum, his response of playing hardball might be a necessary step to protect his own needs. So, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries in a situation where the other person isn't compromising.\n"
