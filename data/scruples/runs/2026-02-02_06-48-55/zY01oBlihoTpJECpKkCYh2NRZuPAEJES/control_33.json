I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong about not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a dog person and really dislikes cats. He has specific reasons: cats don't show affection the way he wants, they're hard to train, and they've scratched or bitten him. He's even thinking about marriage and moving in together, but the cat is a deal-breaker for him. He's tried to discuss it with his girlfriend, but she's been firm, even to the point of giving an ultimatum about breaking up if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a year and sees them as a package deal. She might feel that the cat is part of her life and isn't willing to give it up. Her response seems pretty rigid, which could be an issue. However, relationships often require compromise, and if the author is willing to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents), but she's not, maybe she's being unreasonable.\n\nBut wait, the author is asking if *he's* in the wrong. The key here is whether his stance is fair. His reasons are valid because they're about his personal comfort and living situation. He's not asking her to give up the cat permanently, just to not bring it into their shared home. However, if the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, maybe the real issue is her not being flexible. \n\nBut the question is about the author's position. Is it wrong for him to set a boundary? If he's honest about his feelings and communicated them, then it's not wrong. He's not being cruel to the cat; he's just not wanting it in his home. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but if the author is now considering playing hardball by not moving in until the cat is rehomed, is that an asshole move?\n\nHmm. The author's position is about his own living preferences. He's tried to be rational. The girlfriend's reaction seems overly harsh. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. The key points are that the author has valid reasons, has communicated them, and the girlfriend isn't willing to budge. The author's stance is about his comfort and future home, which is a legitimate concern. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
