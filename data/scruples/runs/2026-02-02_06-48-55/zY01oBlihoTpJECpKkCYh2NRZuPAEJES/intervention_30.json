I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a relationship with a girlfriend who has a cat. He really doesn't like cats, especially because of their behavior and the problems they cause, like scratching and making noise. He wants her to move in with him but doesn't want the cat to come. She refuses and gives him an ultimatum: either he takes the cat or they break up.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear about his dislike for cats, which is affecting his comfort and even his dog's possible interaction. He's tried to talk to her calmly and offered solutions like the cat staying with her parents. But she's not budging and is holding the relationship hostage with the cat as a condition. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might see the cat as part of her life and not just something to rehome. Maybe she's attached to the cat, and she might think that moving in together should involve both of their pets. But the author isn't saying he wants to get rid of the cat entirely, just that it shouldn't live with him. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss it, but she responded with a cold ultimatum. That seems harsh. However, the author is also considering a hardball move by threatening to not let her move in unless the cat is rehomed. Is that fair? \n\nIf the author is honest about his feelings and they are valid, maybe it's not his fault. But maybe he's being inflexible too. However, the girlfriend's response seems extreme. Holding the relationship hostage because of the cat might not be healthy. \n\nSo, considering that he's trying to find a solution (like parents) and she's not open to compromise, the author isn't necessarily wrong to set a boundary. If he can't live with the cat, it's part of his living space. The problem is the ultimatum from her side, which might be the main issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground.\n"
