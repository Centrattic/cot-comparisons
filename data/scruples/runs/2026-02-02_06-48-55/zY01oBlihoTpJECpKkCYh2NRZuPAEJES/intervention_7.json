I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The situation involves the author not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He has specific issues with the cat's behavior\u2014scratching, biting, noise, etc. He's tried to discuss this with his girlfriend, but she's firm, even giving an ultimatum about the cat staying or breaking up. He's considering playing hardball by saying the cat has to go before moving in.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to see if I agree. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to talk to his girlfriend about the cat, but she was unwilling to compromise. The girlfriend might feel that the cat is part of her life, and maybe she's attached to it. On the other hand, the author is making a valid point about his comfort and his dog's potential issues.\n\nBut is wanting his girlfriend to rehome the cat an asshole move? Well, he's not saying to get rid of the cat permanently, just that it can't live with them. The girlfriend is being firm, which might be because she doesn't want to part with the cat. The author is at a crossroads, considering moving in together, which is a big step.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If he's not being unreasonable in his request. He's making a case about his own well-being and the dog's compatibility. The girlfriend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's response could be seen as equally hardline. Maybe the problem is that he's not allowing for a middle-ground solution, like temporary arrangements or training the cat. However, the girlfriend is unwilling to budge, which complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the wrong if they're being inflexible. But the author is standing his ground on something that affects his quality of life. If he's willing to walk away, maybe he's just as responsible as she is for not compromising. Alternatively, if his stance is reasonable, he's not in the wrong.\n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up. The author's issues with cats are genuine, and he's not asking to get rid of the cat forever. However, his response to her ultimatum is a counter-ultimatum, which could be seen as equally harsh. In relationships, both sides need to find a compromise. Since neither is willing to budge, it's a stalemate. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his needs, but he might also bear some responsibility for not finding a solution. But given the options, I'm leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
