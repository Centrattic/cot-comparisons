I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing moving in together, and the author doesn't want the girlfriend's cat to come along. He's a dog person and has had issues with cats in the past. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, saying he needs to decide if he's okay with the cat or they break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expressing a genuine dislike for cats, which seems to be a strong personal preference. He's tried to talk to his girlfriend but she's responded with a cold ultimatum. The question is whether he's in the wrong for holding his ground on this issue.\n\nOn one hand, relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is firm about not rehoming the cat, the author might need to consider that. But on the other hand, the author is also making a valid request. He's not being unreasonable about his dog, so why is a cat different? The problem is that he's unwilling to compromise, but the girlfriend is equally unwilling. \n\nThe key points are: the author has a strong aversion to cats, the girlfriend's response was an ultimatum, and he's considering playing hardball by making her rehome the cat if she wants to move in. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. \n\nI should think about whether the author's stance is just a preference versus a deal-breaker. If it's a preference, then compromising might be expected. But if he's unwilling to live with a cat at all, and the girlfriend is equally unwilling to rehome it, then it's a conflict of needs. However, moving in with someone is a big step, and both should ideally address such issues. The author's response is to threaten a breakup, which could be seen as holding the relationship hostage, similar to the girlfriend's approach. \n\nBut the girlfriend already gave an ultimatum. The author is now considering a counter-ultimatum. The question is whether that's an asshole move. If both are using ultimatums, perhaps the author is justified in standing his ground, especially if the cat's presence is causing him significant distress. However, if the cat is manageable (as described as average), maybe the author's refusal is being overly stubborn. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend's parents are nearby might be a point. If the cat could stay with them, that's a possible solution. The author tried that, but she refused. So maybe the girlfriend is being inflexible. \n\nIn terms of fairness, bringing a pet into a shared home is a common issue. The author's dog is already part of his life, but a cat from the girlfriend might require some adjustments. However, if the cat's behavior is problematic (like scratching, biting, getting in the way), and the author is genuinely uncomfortable, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction to the ultimatum is extreme. By turning cold and issuing an ultimatum, she might be the one being unreasonable. But the author's response of playing hardball could also be seen as equally harsh. However, if he's clear about his boundaries and the situation is causing him real issues, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the cat's presence is a significant problem. If it's just personal dislike without actual harm, maybe the author should be more flexible. But if the cat is causing him physical discomfort (scratches, bites, getting in the way), then his stance is more defensible. The girlfriend's response seems to be an overreaction, but the author's considering a counter-ultimatum might also be a strong move. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's being rigid and the cat isn't a problem pet, then maybe yes. But if the issues are real and he's communicated them, then no. The answer might be B (No), because the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if he's not a cat person and the cat's behavior is problematic. However, if there's a way to compromise (like the cat staying with her parents), his refusal could be seen as not trying to work it out, making him the asshole. But the girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives complicates that. \n\nHmm. The story says the cat is average, not particularly bad. The author's issues are more about his dislike. So maybe B is the right answer because he's being honest about his preferences and the girlfriend is being inflexible. But some might argue that once a relationship is serious, personal preferences should be considered less important than the partner's needs. So it's a tricky balance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's upfront about his feelings and his dog's potential reaction. The girlfriend's ultimatum is more extreme. So the answer is B.\n"
