I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them, and the girlfriend giving an ultimatum. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a dog person and really dislikes cats, citing their aloofness, the scratches, and specific behaviors of the cat causing him stress. He wants her to move in but doesn't want the cat. When he tried to discuss it, she became cold and gave an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up. The author is considering standing his ground and refusing unless the cat is rehomed.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's feelings about cats are valid\u2014he's not a fan, and the cat's behavior is bothering him. However, the girlfriend's position is that the cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to compromise. She's essentially saying that the cat is non-negotiable. The author is now considering matching her ultimatum with his own.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, both sides have their own valid points. The author has the right to his preferences about his living space, especially if he's inviting someone to move in. On the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her pet, especially if she's had the cat for some time.\n\nBut the key issue here is how the problem is being handled. The author tried to discuss it calmly, and the girlfriend responded with an ultimatum. However, the author is now contemplating doing the same. Is that fair? If both are holding the relationship hostage with ultimatums, it's a problem. However, the initial trigger is the girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives, like the cat living with her parents. The author's response is a hardline stance, but maybe he's justified if he's clear about his boundaries. However, if he's willing to walk away over this, it's not necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether his position is reasonable. Since he's the one who brought up the issue first and tried to find a compromise (suggesting the parents), but the girlfriend closed the door, maybe his response is a justified stand on his own terms. So, B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
