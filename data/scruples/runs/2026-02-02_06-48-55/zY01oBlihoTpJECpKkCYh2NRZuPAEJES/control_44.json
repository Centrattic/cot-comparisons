I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The key points here are the couple's differing preferences regarding pets and their handling of the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and really dislikes cats, citing issues like the cat's behavior and their own negative experiences. The girlfriend is a cat person and sees the cat as part of her family, refusing to rehome it. They're at a point where moving in together is being considered, which brings up this conflict.\n\nThe author tried to discuss it calmly and even suggested the cat stay with her parents, but the girlfriend reacted strongly and gave an ultimatum. The author is now considering responding with a hardball approach by refusing to move in unless the cat is rehomed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is reasonable. He has valid reasons for his dislike of cats, and it's his home. However, the girlfriend's emotional attachment to the cat is also significant. The problem arises in the ultimatum from the girlfriend, which is a harsh reaction. The author's response as a hardball move is a tit-for-tat, but does that make him wrong?\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting a cat, especially if it causes him stress. However, the way he's considering responding with a hard ultimatum might be seen as equally harsh. But given that the girlfriend already turned the discussion into a breakup threat, the author's stance could be justified as trying to set boundaries for his living space.\n\nAlso, pets are part of someone's life, and expecting someone to rehome a pet is a big ask. The author's position is about his home and comfort. While it's a tough spot, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise is problematic, but the author's desire to maintain his home environment is valid. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's more to consider.\n"
