I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. They're a dog person and really dislike cats, which is causing some tension. The girlfriend is being very firm, saying it's a package deal. The user is considering giving an ultimatum as well.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong here. The key points are the validity of their request, the girlfriend's reaction, and the overall context of the relationship. \n\nPersonal preferences about pets can be a significant issue when couples cohabit. The author has clear reasons: they don't like cats, find them problematic, and there's potential for the pets to not get along. The girlfriend, however, is unwilling to compromise, which is a red flag. Her response of making an ultimatum suggests she's not open to discussion. \n\nBut the author's own response of considering an ultimatum (saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed) is the crux here. Is that a reasonable move? It depends on whether the issue is a deal-breaker for both parties. The author is upfront about their preferences, and the girlfriend's refusal to even consider alternatives might indicate that the cat is a non-negotiable for her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're being reasonable and the girlfriend is not, the author might not be in the wrong for standing their ground. However, if the author's approach is too harsh without trying other solutions, maybe they are. But given the girlfriend's cold response to alternatives like the cat staying with her parents, it seems she's not willing to compromise. The author's ultimatum is a response to her ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author tried to discuss it calmly, and the girlfriend's reaction was hostile. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, whether their response is an \"asshole move\" depends on context. If the cat's presence is causing real issues (allergies, safety, etc.), it's more justified. Here, it's more about personal dislike, but it's a valid personal preference. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is using the cat as an excuse for deeper issues or if the cat isn't a significant problem, maybe. But from the given info, the author's dislike is genuine and specific. The girlfriend's refusal to budge is also problematic. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're expressing their genuine preference and the girlfriend is the one being inflexible. However, the situation is nuanced. The author's final question is whether their potential ultimatum is an asshole move. Since the girlfriend has already set a hard boundary, the author's response could be seen as fair. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
