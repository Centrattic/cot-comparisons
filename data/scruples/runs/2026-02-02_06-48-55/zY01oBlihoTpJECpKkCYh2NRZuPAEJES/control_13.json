I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. So first, I need to understand both sides of the situation.\n\nThe author is a dog person and clearly doesn't like cats. He has strong feelings against them, mentioning scratches, bites, and the cat's aloofness. He's had a dog all his life, so he's used to a more social pet. Now he's considering moving in with his girlfriend who has a cat. He's tried to talk to her about rehoming the cat but she's not open to it, even to the point of giving an ultimatum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting the cat to live with them.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons based on his personal preferences and his dog's potential compatibility. If the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, maybe it's reasonable for him to set a boundary. On the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life, and she's invested in keeping it. The author's ultimatum could be seen as harsh, but so is her refusal to even consider rehoming the cat. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which are significant because of his dislike of cats. The girlfriend's response is rigid, not open to discussion. The author isn't being unreasonable because he's made efforts to talk about it. If the girlfriend isn't willing to meet him halfway, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nAlso, considering that the relationship is about to become more serious (moving in together), it's important that both partners can agree on major life decisions. If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise on something the author finds unacceptable, it's fair for the author to prioritize his well-being. The answer would hinge on whether the author's stance is a legitimate personal boundary rather than an overreaction. Since the author has a clear history of discomfort with cats and the girlfriend isn't budging, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
