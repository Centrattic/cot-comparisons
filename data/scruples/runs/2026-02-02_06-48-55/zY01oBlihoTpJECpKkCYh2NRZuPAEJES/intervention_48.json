I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in. The author is a dog person and has a lot of negative feelings towards cats, even though he acknowledges they aren't all bad. He's tried to discuss it with his girlfriend, but she's taking a hard stance, and he's considering a similar approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has valid reasons for not wanting a cat. He's had negative experiences, finds cats uncooperative, and is used to dogs. His dog is important to him. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and isn't willing to part with it. She sees it as part of her life now. Moving in together is a big step, and compatibility is key. \n\nThe author approached the topic before moving in, which is reasonable. He tried to communicate his concerns, but she responded with an ultimatum. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting the cat or for considering a counter-ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and compromise are important. If the girlfriend isn't willing to consider alternatives, maybe the author's stance is justified. However, the author's strong negative feelings towards cats might seem extreme to some. But he's consistent in his reasons. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise could be the bigger issue here. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if his position is fair. The key points are communication attempts, the significance of the move-in decision, and whether the author's refusal is a deal-breaker. Since pets are big commitments, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's ultimatum is harsh, so the author's response might be a necessary compromise for his own well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his needs and tried to find a solution. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise complicates things, but the author's position is valid given his preferences and the importance of the decision.\n"
