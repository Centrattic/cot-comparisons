I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting the girlfriend to bring her cat when moving in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a self-proclaimed dog person and doesn't like cats at all. He lists valid reasons like allergies (though he didn't mention allergies, but maybe scratches from the cat?), the cat's behavior (jumping, scratching, noise), and compatibility with his dog. He's also concerned about the cat affecting their future together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend seems to love the cat and sees them as a package deal. She responded with an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh. The author tried to discuss it calmly, but she didn't budge and even turned cold. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nPersonal preferences about pets are subjective. The author has a legitimate issue with the cat, which affects his living environment. He's not asking her to get rid of the cat immediately but rather not to bring it when moving in together. That's a reasonable request. However, the girlfriend's reaction is extreme\u2014holding the relationship hostage with an ultimatum. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Probably not. He's within his rights to have preferences about his home. However, maybe he could have approached the conversation differently. But the main issue is that the girlfriend is not compromising. \n\nThe author's suggestion to play hardball by making her rehome the cat if she doesn't agree might be seen as an asshole move because it's a direct threat. But considering her ultimatum, he's just mirroring her approach. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some. The author should have addressed this earlier, maybe before moving in together. But since it's a new relationship, it's not clear how much time they've had to discuss such things. \n\nThe key points are: the author's valid concerns about living with a cat, the girlfriend's refusal to compromise, and the ultimatum. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting the cat, but his response could be seen as an asshole move if he retaliates. However, given her extreme reaction, maybe he's justified in setting that boundary. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his preferences, but his response might be seen as an asshole move. But the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong. The initial issue is about not wanting the cat, which is his right. The problem is how he's resolving it. However, since the girlfriend gave an ultimatum, he's just reflecting her approach. So maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
