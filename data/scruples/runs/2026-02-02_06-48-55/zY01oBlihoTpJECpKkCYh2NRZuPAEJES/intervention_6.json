I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario where the author is conflicted about not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a dog person who has never had a cat and really dislikes them. They have a strong opinion about cats being aloof, difficult to train, and causing discomfort through scratches and bites. Their girlfriend, who they're considering moving in with, has a cat. She insists that the cat comes along, even offering an ultimatum if the author doesn't agree. The author is frustrated because when they tried to discuss it, the girlfriend was cold and gave a hard choice.\n\nThe main points here are the author's personal dislike of cats versus the girlfriend's attachment to her cat. The author is trying to set boundaries about their living space and their dog's potential compatibility. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is firm about keeping the cat, which is understandable since she's likely attached to it.\n\nNow, considering the question: is the author in the wrong? Well, they're being honest about their feelings towards cats. It's reasonable to have preferences about pets in a shared living space. The author isn't being cruel to the cat; they just don't want it in their home. However, they are asking the girlfriend to rehome the cat, which could be a big request. But given that the author is the one who will be living with the cat, their preferences matter just as much as the girlfriend's.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, using an ultimatum and making it about commitment. Maybe she's not considering the author's valid concerns. The author is trying to communicate their position calmly and rationally, which is the right approach. However, the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, which is problematic.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Probably not. It's their right to have a say in their living environment. The real issue is the girlfriend's refusal to negotiate and her ultimatum. The author is in a tough spot, but they aren't in the wrong for stating their boundaries. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's rigid stance. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
