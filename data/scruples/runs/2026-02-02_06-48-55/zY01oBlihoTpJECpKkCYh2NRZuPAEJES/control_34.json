I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He doesn't like their behavior, finds them unaffectionate, and has had bad experiences with scratches and bites. His current dog is his best friend, so maybe he's comparing the cat to that relationship.\n\nHe's been with his girlfriend for almost a year and sees a future with her, including marriage and her moving in. However, he's clear about not wanting a cat. He's tried to discuss it, suggesting the cat could stay with her parents, but she's firm, calling them a package deal. She even gave an ultimatum about the relationship if he doesn't accept the cat.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? The key factors here are mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is expressing a valid personal preference, which is important. But the girlfriend is also firm about her pet, which is a significant part of her life. \n\nIn relationships, compromises are necessary. If the girlfriend is unwilling to find a middle ground, maybe the author is justified in standing his ground. However, the ultimatum she gave might be extreme, but so is his demand to rehome the cat. Are both sides being unreasonable here?\n\nThe author's argument is that the cat's presence would affect his quality of life and his dog's comfort. On the other hand, the girlfriend's attachment to her pet is genuine. It's a classic case of conflicting priorities. \n\nIs it fair for the author to say no to the cat? If both are unwilling to compromise, maybe the issue is bigger than just the cat. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the cat as non-negotiable, which might be a dealbreaker. But does that make the author the asshole? \n\nHe's not being aggressive; he's setting boundaries. The girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage, but he's responding in kind. The question is whether his stance is reasonable. Since pets can be a big deal, and he's upfront about his feelings, it's a matter of whose needs are more important in a relationship. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. Both sides have valid points, but the author is standing up for his own well-being. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
