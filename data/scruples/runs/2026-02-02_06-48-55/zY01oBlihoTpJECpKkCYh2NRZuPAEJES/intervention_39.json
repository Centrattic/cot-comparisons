I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they don't want their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person and has had issues with cats, like scratches and bites, and finds the cat annoying. The girlfriend is being very firm and even giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting a cat. They mention specific problems with the cat's behavior and their own discomfort around cats. It's important to respect personal boundaries and comfort zones. However, pets can be a significant part of someone's life, and the girlfriend has had the cat for a while. \n\nThe girlfriend is being confrontational and using a hard ultimatum, which is definitely not ideal. Relationships require compromise, and holding a breakup over a pet seems extreme. On the other hand, the author is considering their own well-being and the compatibility with their dog. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to prioritize their own needs here? Maybe not entirely. People should be able to set boundaries. But the way the girlfriend is reacting is problematic. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the cat is her pet and she's loved it, expecting her to rehome it just because he's uncomfortable might be seen as selfish. However, if the cat's presence causes significant distress or conflict, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe author tried to discuss it calmly but the girlfriend didn't budge. The ultimatum is on her part, so the author's response of playing hardball could be a reaction to that. But is the author wrong for not wanting the cat? It depends on how much the cat's presence affects their life. If it's just discomfort and not a health issue, maybe the author is being too rigid. However, if the cat is causing real problems (like allergies, aggression, etc.), then it's more justified. \n\nIn the given scenario, the author mentions scratches and bites, but also that the cat is average. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be the bigger issue. So, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable, especially if the cat's presence is causing them stress. But the way they're framing it as \"playing hardball back\" might be problematic if the girlfriend's attachment is significant. \n\nUltimately, the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to their preferences and comfort. The girlfriend's ultimatum is the main problem here. The author isn't forcing her to rehome the cat but is stating their own boundary. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
