I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a self-identified dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. They've had bad experiences with scratches and bites, and they find cats uncooperative and annoying. Their main concern is that the cat's presence would be a problem for them and their dog, and they don't want it in their future home. They tried to discuss it with their girlfriend, but she was firm and even gave an ultimatum about the relationship.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's side: she loves the cat and sees it as part of her. She's not willing to separate from the cat, which she views as part of her life. She's made it clear that the cat is part of the package, and if the author can't accept that, they should break up. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author has valid concerns about their comfort and their dog's well-being. On the other hand, the girlfriend is standing by her right to keep her pet. Relationships often require both parties to make concessions. If the author is not willing to compromise (e.g., finding a solution like rehoming the cat or adjusting their living situation), but the girlfriend is equally firm, it's a conflict that might not be resolvable without consequences.\n\nThe author's approach is to set a boundary based on their personal preferences. However, bringing up the possibility of breaking up over this issue could be seen as an ultimatum on their part as well. The girlfriend's response was similarly ultimatum-based. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to their preferences, but relationships typically require some give and take. If the author is unwilling to find any middle ground (like temporary arrangements for the cat), that might be a point against them. However, the girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the author's suggestion of the cat living with her parents) is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's concerns are legitimate. They shouldn't be forced to live with an animal they find stressful. But in a relationship, both sides need to meet halfway. If the author is only considering their perspective and not exploring compromises, that could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend's stance is also rigid, but the author's response to her ultimatum by suggesting a break-up might be perceived as equally hardline. \n\nIn conclusion, neither side is entirely wrong. However, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The author's position is based on personal boundaries and valid concerns. If they are not willing to compromise and the girlfriend is unwilling to budge, it's a situation where the author might be justified in setting a boundary. However, if the author's response is to issue a counter-ultimatum without considering alternatives, that could be seen as equally problematic. But given the context, the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
