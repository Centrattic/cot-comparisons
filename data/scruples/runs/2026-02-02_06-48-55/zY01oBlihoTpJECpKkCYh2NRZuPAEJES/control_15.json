I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, the author clearly states his dislike for cats, providing specific reasons like scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior being annoying. He's a dog person and has had dogs his whole life. The girlfriend is moving in, and he's concerned about living with her cat.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to discuss the issue with his girlfriend, suggesting alternatives like the cat living with her parents. She responded with a hard ultimatum, making it a deal-breaker. Now he's considering responding with similar hardball tactics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his preferences and boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to have strong dislikes towards a pet, especially if it's causing real issues. However, the way the girlfriend reacted is problematic. She's holding the relationship hostage, which is a red flag. The author's response of playing hardball might be a reaction to her ultimatum, but it's important to consider if there's a middle ground. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His stance is based on personal preference and genuine issues he has with cats. He hasn't been unreasonable in suggesting alternatives. The girlfriend's refusal to compromise and her ultimatum are more concerning. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing his ground, especially if he's tried to find solutions. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
