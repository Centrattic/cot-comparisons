I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The person is a dog person who really dislikes cats. They have a girlfriend who's been with them almost a year, and she has a cat. Now, they want her to move in, but they don't want the cat to come. The girlfriend is insisting that the cat comes too, and when the author suggests maybe the cat stays with her parents, she gets cold and gives an ultimatum. The author is considering playing hardball by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed.\n\nFirst, I should think about the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is a significant person in the author's life, and they see a future together. The cat is part of her life, and she's clearly attached to it. The author's dislike for cats is strong, which affects their living environment. The problem is that the author wants the cat out, but the girlfriend refuses, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's response: when the author suggests an alternative (cat with her parents), she says they're a \"package deal.\" That implies that the cat moving in is non-negotiable. Then, when the author brings up the issue again, she gives an ultimatum about the relationship. So the girlfriend is being firm. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid reason based on personal dislike and incompatibility with the cat. But the question is whether it's fair for them to ask the girlfriend to rehome the cat. The girlfriend is also in her right to want her pet to stay. However, the girlfriend's response of an ultimatum might be seen as extreme. The author is now considering matching her ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, compromises are usually expected. However, if both sides have non-negotiables, then the situation becomes a matter of who is willing to walk away. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014like the cat being abused or neglected\u2014but just not having it in their home. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the parents) might be inconsiderate. But the author's threat to force the rehoming could be seen as taking control of the situation unilaterally, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the presence of the cat causes significant distress and the girlfriend is unwilling to budge, the author might have grounds to prioritize their own well-being. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting a boundary. The girlfriend's ultimatum is already a form of playing hardball, so the author's response might be a justified reaction. \n\nBut maybe the author could have explored more options before escalating. For example, maybe the cat could stay in a separate area, or the author could take some time to adjust. However, the author has tried to discuss it and the girlfriend hasn't been open to alternatives. So, in that case, the author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their living conditions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're standing up for their boundaries. The girlfriend's ultimatum is also a hard stance, so the author's response is a reasonable counter.\n"
