I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly states he's a dog person and doesn't like cats. He lists specific reasons: cats don't show affection, require training, can scratch or bite, and the cat in question has already been a nuisance with behaviors like jumping on shelves and yowling. He also mentions that his dog might not get along with the cat, and he's not willing to compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is attached to her cat and presented an ultimatum: the cat comes with her, or they break up. The author is considering whether it's an asshole move to play hardball and refuse to move in until she rehomes the cat.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Relationships require compromise, but both parties have needs. The author's dislike of cats is a personal preference, but it's affecting his living environment and well-being. The girlfriend's stance is firm, which might indicate that the cat is a non-negotiable part of her life. \n\nHowever, using the relationship as a bargaining chip (ultimatum) is a red flag. The girlfriend's response of \"either both move in or break up\" is extreme. The author is trying to express his valid concerns, and if she's not open to discussion, maybe the issue is about mutual respect and willingness to find a middle ground.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Not necessarily. His preferences are valid. But if he responds with a similar ultimatum, that could be seen as equally harsh. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong for his initial stance. \n\nGiven that he's tried to communicate calmly and she's not budging, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The problem here might be more about her not being flexible. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
