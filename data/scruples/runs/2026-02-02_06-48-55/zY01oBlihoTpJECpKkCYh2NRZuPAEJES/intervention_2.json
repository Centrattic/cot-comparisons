I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't want his girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. He's a dog person and has issues with cats\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior, etc. He's tried talking to her, but she's not budging and even given an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting a cat. He's had negative experiences, finds cats difficult, and is concerned about getting along with the cat and whether his dog will. On the other hand, his girlfriend clearly loves her cat and sees it as part of her life. She's even threatened to break up if he doesn't accept the cat, which is pretty serious.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. The author is trying to communicate his needs and concerns. He's not being unreasonable about not wanting a pet that he dislikes, especially considering the potential conflicts. However, the girlfriend is taking a hard stance, which might not be healthy for the relationship. The author is now considering playing hardball by not letting her move in unless she rehomes the cat.\n\nIs it fair for the author to set this boundary? Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit. If the cat is causing significant distress and there's no middle ground, maybe the author is justified. However, threatening to break up or hold the relationship hostage because of a pet might be extreme. The girlfriend's reaction is also a problem because she's not considering his feelings and is giving an ultimatum. \n\nBut the author's response of not allowing her to move in unless she rehomes the cat could be seen as equally ultimatum-based. It's possible that the author is trying to stand his ground, but maybe there's a way to negotiate. Maybe finding an alternative for the cat, like keeping it with her parents part-time or finding a pet-friendly place. However, the author's main point is that he doesn't want the cat in his home at all.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being reasonable and trying to communicate his needs, but the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. However, threatening to break up over a pet might be a red flag. Also, the author's willingness to consider alternatives (like the parents) shows he's trying. The girlfriend's refusal to consider that solution is part of the issue. \n\nBut the author's final question is about whether he's in the wrong for considering an ultimatum. If he's responded to her ultimatum with his own, that could be seen as playing hardball. However, if the situation is a deal-breaker for him, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect, and if the girlfriend isn't respecting his feelings, maybe the author is justified in setting a boundary. \n\nSo, I'm a bit torn. The author has valid concerns, but his response might be as extreme as hers. However, given that the girlfriend was the one who gave an ultimatum first, maybe the author is just trying to protect his own boundaries. In that case, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the author is being unreasonable about a pet, maybe A. Hmm.\n"
