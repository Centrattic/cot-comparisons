I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats, even though he acknowledges they aren't bad by cat standards. He's had issues with the cat's behavior and is worried about living with it. His girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, and he's considering playing hardball.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he has a strong dislike for cats, which affects his comfort and well-being. He's clear that he doesn't want the cat in his home. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat for a while and sees it as part of her life. She's unwilling to rehome it, which leads to the conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the cat? Well, people have different preferences about pets. It's reasonable for someone to prefer their home environment not to include an animal they dislike. However, the way he's approaching it with an ultimatum might be problematic. He's suggesting that if she can't rehome the cat, they break up. That feels like a harsh response, especially since the cat isn't the girlfriend's fault. Maybe there are compromises, like the cat staying with her parents as initially suggested. But she rejected that. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also intense, holding the relationship hostage. But the author's response of playing hardball is equally extreme. The question is whether his stance is reasonable. Since he's not being unreasonable in his preference, but the ultimatum might be too harsh, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since he's trying to communicate his needs and the girlfriend isn't willing to budge, maybe he's not wrong to set boundaries. But the way he's framing it as an AITA might mean that the community would see him as not in the wrong because he's standing up for his comfort. However, some might argue that he's prioritizing his dislike over her pet, which is part of her life. But given the intensity of his dislike and valid concerns about living together, it's a tough call. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries for his own comfort, but it's a close call.\n"
