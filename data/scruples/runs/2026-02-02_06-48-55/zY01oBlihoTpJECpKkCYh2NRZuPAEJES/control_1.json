I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should allow his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author doesn't like cats at all, has a dog he's close to, and the girlfriend is being very firm about keeping the cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons. He's not a fan of cats, has had bad experiences, and is worried about compatibility with his dog. He's thinking about the future, wanting to move in together. On the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to separate from it. She's given an ultimatum, which is tough.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the cat. The girlfriend's stance is that the cat comes with her, which makes sense because pets are part of a person's life. But the author is also entitled to his preferences in his own home. However, the author's response is to consider giving an ultimatum too, which could be seen as playing hardball. \n\nIs it fair for the author to ask his girlfriend to rehome the cat? Maybe, but the way he's approaching it (playing hardball) might be problematic. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's response could also be seen as extreme. \n\nI need to think about the dynamics of the relationship. Communication is key. The author tried to talk about it, and the girlfriend was cold. The girlfriend's ultimatum is a red flag because it's not healthy to hold a relationship hostage. However, the author's threat to make her rehome the cat is also a hard stance. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe finding a compromise, like the cat staying with her parents part-time or creating a cat-friendly space. But the author doesn't mention trying those options. He jumps to ultimatums. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong for wanting her pet to stay with her. The author isn't wrong for not wanting a cat. However, the way both are handling it might be where the problem is. The author's consideration of playing hardball could be seen as in the wrong because it's a hostile approach. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. Since he's not forcing her to give up the cat but is considering it as a response to her ultimatum, maybe he's justified in standing his ground. However, the act of using an ultimatum himself might be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's needs is important. The author's stance is about his home and his comfort, which is valid. But how he's handling it could be problematic. The answer depends on whether his approach is the asshole move. The girlfriend's ultimatum is definitely an asshole move, but the author's threat is also a strong move. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, yes, he is. If B, no. Considering that the girlfriend's response was more extreme, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he's responding with an ultimatum, that's also a problem. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's preferences are valid, but the way he's handling it (threatening to make her rehome the cat) might be where he's in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's initial ultimatum is worse. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, no, he's not in the wrong.\n"
