I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats because of their behavior, like scratching, biting, and not being social. His girlfriend has a cat, and she's not willing to separate from it. The author is considering asking her to rehome the cat, but she's given an ultimatum that if he can't handle the cat, they should break up. He's thinking of responding with a similar ultimatum.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships require compromise. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat: personal discomfort, potential conflict with his dog, and stress. On the other hand, the girlfriend's cat is a pet, which is part of her life and identity. She's made it clear that the cat is part of the deal. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and willingness to find a solution. The author tried to discuss it calmly, but she became unyielding. However, the author is also considering a hardball approach. Is this fair? Well, if the cat's presence causes significant distress and the girlfriend isn't open to alternatives (like keeping the cat at her parents' when they move in), then it's a matter of compatibility. \n\nBut the girlfriend's refusal to consider options might be the bigger issue. The author's stance isn't about being against cats but about his own well-being. If she's not willing to negotiate, maybe the problem is her unwillingness to compromise. However, the author's proposed response of making her rehome the cat could be seen as equally ultimatum-like, which might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's trying to communicate his needs and the situation is affecting their potential future together, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The problem might be more on the girlfriend's side for not being flexible. So the answer is B (No).\n"
