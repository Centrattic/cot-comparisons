I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The author is a dog person who really dislikes cats and has had bad experiences with them. They love their girlfriend but can't stand the cat. They've tried talking about it, but the girlfriend is firm, even giving an ultimatum. The author is considering giving a similar ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not liking cats\u2014specifically, the cat's behavior, like scratching, biting, and noise. They also worry about how their dog might interact with the cat. It's reasonable for someone to have preferences about pets in their home, especially if they've had negative experiences.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend has a cat and sees it as part of her life. She's given an ultimatum, which is a strong move. The author is now considering matching that with their own ultimatum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nIn relationships, big decisions often require compromise. But when one person's deal-breaker is another's non-negotiable, it's tricky. The author is asking if it's an asshole move to say the cat can't come. The girlfriend's response was harsh, but the author's potential response is similarly hardline. \n\nIt's important to note that pets are part of someone's life and can be hard to give up. However, the author's home is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author has expressed concerns about the cat's behavior and their own discomfort, it's understandable. But the ultimatum approach can be seen as inflexible. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require both parties to meet in the middle. However, if the cat's presence is causing significant distress and there's no compromise (like temporary arrangements), then the author's stance might be justified. However, using the cat as a bargaining chip in an ultimatum could be seen as matching the girlfriend's hostility, which isn't ideal. \n\nBut the girlfriend's initial ultimatum was more about breaking up rather than resolving the issue. The author's response is a reaction to that. The question is whether the author's response is wrong. Given that the author has legitimate concerns and the girlfriend refused to negotiate, the author's stance might be defensible. However, the way they're approaching it (ultimatum) could be seen as equally harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have valid points. The author isn't wrong for having preferences, but using a hardline approach without trying alternatives might not be the best. However, the girlfriend's refusal to compromise complicates things. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their space and preferences. The girlfriend's ultimatum was harsh, and the author is trying to set boundaries. However, the method of response (playing hardball) might be seen as equally harsh. But given the girlfriend's stance, the author's position isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
