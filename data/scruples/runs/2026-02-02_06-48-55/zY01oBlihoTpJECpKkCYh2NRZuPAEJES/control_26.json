I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together. The author is a dog person and finds cats annoying, especially the cat's behavior. They tried to talk to the girlfriend, but she gave an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or the relationship is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's personal preference against cats is strong, and they've had negative experiences. The girlfriend's response is firm, which is a big factor. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong if they set a similar ultimatum in return.\n\nIn relationships, especially when considering cohabitation, both partners need to make compromises. The author's concern is about their own well-being and the dog's compatibility. However, the girlfriend's stance is also significant. She might have a strong bond with the cat, and rehoming it could be a last resort for her. The author is trying to communicate their boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. \n\nBut the girlfriend's response seems extreme. Giving an ultimatum without room for discussion can be seen as holding the relationship hostage. The author's proposal to play hardball is a reaction to that. The main issue here is that the author is trying to maintain their own comfort and living situation. \n\nI should check if the author's position is valid. They have a legitimate dislike for cats, not just a preference. The cat's behavior is causing them stress and discomfort. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be the bigger issue here. \n\nHowever, pets are a big part of some people's lives, so the girlfriend might feel that the cat is a non-negotiable part of her life. The author's request is about their home, which is a fair consideration. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting each other's needs. The author isn't being unreasonable in not wanting a cat in their home, especially if they find it intolerable. The girlfriend's ultimatum is the problem, but the author's response of setting their own conditions is a form of standing their ground. \n\nIn such cases, compromise is essential. Maybe the author can suggest solutions like the girlfriend's parents taking the cat temporarily, or finding a cat-friendly environment. But since the girlfriend is not open to it, the author's position of not wanting the cat might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they are asserting their own comfort and living conditions, which is a valid part of a relationship. The girlfriend's ultimatum is the issue here, not the author's request.\n"
