I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and doesn't like cats at all. They've had negative experiences with cats, like scratches and bites, and find them unresponsive. Their girlfriend is a cat person and the cat is part of her life. She's given an ultimatum that the cat comes with her, or they break up. The author is considering an ultimatum back.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong for setting this boundary. On one hand, people have different preferences about pets. It's reasonable for the author to not want a cat in their home. But relationships require compromise. However, the girlfriend's response was a hard ultimatum, which might not be healthy. The author is now thinking of doing the same.\n\nIs it wrong for the author to stand their ground? Well, having a pet is a big decision, and both partners need to agree. If the author is certain they can't live with a cat, it's their right to set that boundary. But the way they're considering responding\u2014playing hardball\u2014might be seen as equally hostile. However, if the girlfriend was unwilling to discuss alternatives, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not giving in. It's about mutual respect and compromise. If the girlfriend was open to solutions, maybe the author should have explored more options. But she wasn't, so maybe the author is justified in their stance. \n\nAlso, pets are a significant part of someone's life. The girlfriend might feel that giving up the cat is a deal-breaker. So, both have valid points. But the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether setting such a firm boundary is reasonable. Since the author has legitimate reasons (allergies, personal dislike, potential conflict with their dog), and the girlfriend was unwilling to negotiate, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the approach of an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But given the girlfriend's previous ultimatum, maybe it's a matter of both parties being firm on their needs. \n\nIn relationships, when core values or deal-breakers are involved, it's okay to set boundaries. If the author can't compromise on pets, then it's their right. But the method of resolving it (playing hardball) might be seen as an asshole move if it's not respectful. However, since the girlfriend was already using an ultimatum, the author might feel it's necessary for self-respect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they have valid reasons and the girlfriend was unwilling to discuss alternatives. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, given the scenario, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and preferences, especially if the relationship requires compromising on something non-negotiable for the author.\n"
