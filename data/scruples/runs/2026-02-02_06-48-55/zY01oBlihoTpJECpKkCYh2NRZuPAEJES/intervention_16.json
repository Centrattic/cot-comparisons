I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a dog person who really doesn't like his girlfriend's cat. They're planning to move in together, but he doesn't want the cat to come. His girlfriend is being very firm, saying they're a package deal, and he's considering an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has valid reasons for not liking cats\u2014personal experiences with scratches, bites, and the cat's behavior. He's tried to discuss it calmly, but the girlfriend is not budging. She's even given an ultimatum. The author is considering his own ultimatum in response.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a legitimate emotional attachment to her cat. Pets are often considered family, so asking her to rehome it is a big ask. On the other hand, the author has his own needs and preferences, especially regarding living with a pet he dislikes and potential conflicts with his own dog.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. The key here is about mutual respect and compromise. The author tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend didn't compromise. However, the author is now considering a harsh response. Is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to live together, both partners need to make sacrifices. If the author is unwilling to accept the cat under any circumstances, that's a hard line. But if the girlfriend is equally firm, then it's a conflict of values. The author's response of an ultimatum might be seen as holding the relationship hostage as well. So maybe he is in the wrong by taking a similar approach to hers. However, if the girlfriend is entirely unmoving, then the author's stance could be justified if he feels this is a deal-breaker. It's a bit of a toss-up. I need to decide if his response is an asshole move or a reasonable boundary. Since he's not wrong for having preferences, but his ultimatum might be the asshole move if it's too harsh. The girlfriend's ultimatum was first, though. Maybe the author is justified in setting his own boundaries. Hmm. I think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key is whether his response is proportionate. If he's trying to set a boundary after she's already given an ultimatum, maybe it's not the asshole move. So I might go with B (No).\n"
