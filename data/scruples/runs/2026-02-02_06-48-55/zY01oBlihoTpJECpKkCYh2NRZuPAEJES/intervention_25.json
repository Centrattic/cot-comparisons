I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want the cat to move in with them when they plan to live together. He's given some reasons: cats are aloof, hard to train, and the specific cat has caused him some issues like scratches and noise. He's tried to talk to her about it, but she's being very firm, even giving an ultimatum. Now he's considering giving her an ultimatum back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. He's been scratched, the cat's behavior is annoying, and he's concerned about how his dog might react. It's his home, and he's entitled to his preferences. On the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her cat, which is a pet she cares about. She might see the cat as part of her family and not want to rehome it, which can be a big decision for someone.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author tried to talk to her, but she responded with a hard ultimatum. That's a problem because relationships require mutual respect and flexibility. However, the author is also setting a boundary about his living space. If he's not comfortable with the cat in his home, that's a legitimate concern. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for standing his ground. If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise and the author has made his position clear, maybe he's not wrong to enforce his boundary. Relationships should be about both parties' needs being considered. If she's not willing to meet him halfway, like finding a solution where the cat can stay sometimes but not live there full-time, then maybe the author is justified in his stance.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how he's handling it. If he's now threatening to play hardball by saying she can't move in unless she rehomes the cat, that might be seen as equally ultimatum-like. However, given that she already gave an ultimatum, perhaps he's just mirroring her approach. The problem is whether either side is being unreasonable. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for having strong feelings about cats. People have different preferences. But if the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives (like the parents taking the cat sometimes, even if not all the time), then maybe the author is right to prioritize his own comfort. However, if the girlfriend's attachment to the cat is significant and she's not open to any solutions, then this could be a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for not wanting the cat in his home. The girlfriend's refusal to budge might be the bigger issue. But since the author is now considering an ultimatum as well, it's a bit of a stalemate. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his stance is reasonable. Since he's communicated his concerns and she hasn't been flexible, maybe he's not in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
