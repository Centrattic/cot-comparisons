I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: he's had bad experiences with cats, finds them unmanageable, and is worried about his dog's compatibility. His main point is about his personal comfort and future living situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend sees the cat as part of her life and isn't willing to part with it, which is understandable since pets can be like family.\n\nThe key point here is communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss it calmly, but the girlfriend reacted strongly, even giving an ultimatum. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. While it's his home, pets can be a big deal for people. However, he's also considering long-term living arrangements, which is important. \n\nBut does he have the right to ask her to rehome the cat? That might be a deal-breaker for her. If he's not willing to compromise, maybe he's being firm, but is it an asshole move? It depends on how they handle it. If he's standing his ground because it's his home, that's one angle. But if he's causing her to feel forced to give up her pet, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to budge might be the bigger issue here, but the author's request isn't inherently wrong. People have different needs and preferences. However, the way he's framing it as a non-negotiable could be problematic. The answer would hinge on whether his position is fair given the circumstances. I think both sides have valid points, but since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's reasons are about his own comfort and his dog's well-being. If the cat is causing him stress and there's no middle ground, maybe it's reasonable. But if he's not open to any solution, like temporary arrangements or training, then he's not being fair. The girlfriend's ultimatum is harsh, but his refusal to consider alternatives might also be an issue. Hmm. I think the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for compromise. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to be sure.\n"
