I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The author is a dog person who doesn't like cats and doesn't want his girlfriend's cat to move in with them when they get a place together. The girlfriend is taking it as an ultimatum, saying if the cat doesn't come, it's over. The author is considering if he's in the wrong for wanting the cat to be rehomed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: he dislikes cats, has had negative experiences, and is worried about compatibility with his dog. However, the girlfriend's cat is part of her life, and she's attached to it. The key issue here is communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend was unyielding, which is a problem. But the author is also being firm in his stance, which might be seen as not being flexible enough in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make sacrifices. If the author is willing to move in with his girlfriend but she's not willing to consider rehoming the cat, that's a conflict. However, the author's approach of demanding the cat be rehomed could be seen as harsh, especially if the girlfriend isn't open to that solution. The author's ultimatum might be a reaction to her own ultimatum, creating a cycle of hardball tactics. \n\nBut is the author wrong? He's justified in his dislike of cats. The problem is whether the disagreement is deal-breaker. If the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, maybe the author is right to prioritize his well-being. However, relationships require negotiation. The author might need to consider other solutions, like having the cat in a separate room or finding a different arrangement with the parents. If he's not willing to explore alternatives, he might be at fault for not being open to solutions. \n\nBut the girlfriend's response was extreme, giving an ultimatum. The author's response is a reaction to her ultimatum. So, is he wrong? It's a tough call. The author's stance is based on his comfort and well-being, which is valid. However, the way he's phrased it as a hardball move might not be the healthiest approach. The girlfriend's reaction is also problematic. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his needs, but the situation shows poor communication on both sides. The real issue is whether the girlfriend is being unreasonable. Since the author tried to discuss it and she refused to budge, the fault isn't solely on him. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
