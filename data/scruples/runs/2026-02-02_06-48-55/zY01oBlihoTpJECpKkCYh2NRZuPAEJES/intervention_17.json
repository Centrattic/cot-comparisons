I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a dog person who doesn't like cats and is concerned about his girlfriend's cat coming when she moves in. He's clear about his dislike for cats, even though he acknowledges they're not bad. He's tried to discuss it, but his girlfriend is firm, saying they're a package deal and even threatening a breakup if he doesn't accept the cat. The author is considering playing hardball by making her rehome the cat before moving in.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication attempts, mutual respect, and the ultimatums. The author has tried to explain his feelings calmly, but the girlfriend isn't budging. However, the author is also considering an ultimatum in response. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents), maybe she hasn't shown flexibility. But the author is also setting a hard line without considering her feelings. The cat is part of her life, and expecting her to rehome it could be seen as dismissive of her attachment. However, the author's valid concerns about his dog and his stress from the cat's behavior are also important. \n\nThe situation seems like a stalemate where both are holding firm. The author's decision to move in with her is a major step, and his reluctance to have the cat isn't unwarranted. But demanding she rehome the cat might be as harsh as her ultimatum. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's not wrong for having strong feelings, but his response might be equally harsh. Maybe the right approach is to find a middle ground, but since they're at an impasse, neither is entirely right. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if his stance is justified.\n"
