I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a dog person who really doesn't like cats. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want the cat to move in with her when she moves in. He's tried talking to her about it, but she's been very firm, even giving an ultimatum. Now he's considering responding with his own ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat: he's had negative experiences with cats, finds them unmanageable, and is concerned about his dog's compatibility. His feelings are important, especially since this is about living arrangements. On the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her pet. The cat is part of her life, and she's not willing to give it up, which she sees as a deal-breaker.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for standing his ground. The question is whether he's being unreasonable. The girlfriend's ultimatum is extreme, but does that mean the author is wrong to have his own boundaries? If the author is clear from the start about his preferences, and the girlfriend only agreed to move in under the condition that the cat comes too, then maybe the problem is on her side. But if the author didn't communicate his stance earlier, maybe he's at fault for not discussing it before the move-in plans were set.\n\nThe author mentions they've been dating almost a year and are considering marriage. Major life decisions like moving in together require compromise. The girlfriend might feel that the cat is a non-negotiable part of her life, while the author sees the cat as an obstacle. The fact that she turned \"stone fucking cold\" and gave an ultimatum suggests she's unwilling to find middle ground. However, the author is also considering an ultimatum, which could be seen as equally harsh.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's stance is reasonable. Disliking cats is a personal preference, but pets can be like family. The girlfriend might have emotional attachment to her cat. The author's concerns about the cat's behavior (scratching, biting, noise) are real issues that could affect their living environment. However, if the cat is \"average\" as described, maybe there are ways to manage the situation, like training or keeping the cat in certain areas.\n\nThe author tried to suggest alternatives, like the cat staying with her parents, but she refused. That shows she's not open to compromise. If the author is now considering his own ultimatum, is that fair? If the problem is significant enough to affect their quality of life, maybe he's justified. But holding a relationship hostage over a pet might be seen as selfish. However, the girlfriend did the same by giving an ultimatum first. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's position isn't irrational. He has legitimate concerns. The girlfriend's refusal to budge could be the main issue here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's standing his ground on something important to him, maybe not. But if his stance is inflexible without considering her feelings, maybe he is. However, since the girlfriend was the one to give the ultimatum, perhaps the author's response is a justified countermeasure. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's position is reasonable and if he's given enough leeway. Since he's been upfront about his dislike for cats and the girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
