I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. He's had bad experiences with them\u2014scratches, bites, the cat's behavior is annoying. His girlfriend has a cat, and he doesn't want it to move in with them when they start living together. She's given an ultimatum: either the cat comes too, or they break up. The author is considering playing hardball by saying she can't move in until the cat is rehomed.\n\nSo, the question is about right and wrong here. The key points to consider: Does he have a valid reason to not want the cat? Is his position reasonable? How about her reaction?\n\nHe's not being cruel to the cat; he's just not a fan. His reasons are personal preferences and past experiences. It's his right to set boundaries in his home. However, his girlfriend is equally firm, and she's made it a deal-breaker. \n\nIs he in the wrong for standing his ground? Well, he tried to talk to her calmly and rationally. She responded with an ultimatum. He's considering matching her hardline stance. But is that the wrong move?\n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his preferences. On the other, holding the relationship hostage is extreme. But if she's already done that, maybe he's just mirroring her approach. The question is whether he's wrong for doing so.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's communicated his feelings, and she's not budging. His response is a reaction to her ultimatum. It's a tough spot, but he's not wrong for wanting his home to be a place without cats. So the answer is B.\n"
