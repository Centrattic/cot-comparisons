I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether he's right to not want his girlfriend's cat when she moves in. \n\nFirst, the author is a dog person and doesn't like cats. He lists several reasons: cats don't show affection the way dogs do, they're hard to train, they scratch and bite him. He's had a lot of negative experiences with cats in general and this one specifically. The girlfriend has a cat that's average but still problematic for him. They've been dating a year and he's thinking about moving in together, even considering marriage.\n\nHe's tried to bring up the issue, but the girlfriend is firm. When he suggests alternatives like the cat living with her parents, she says they're a package deal. She then gives an ultimatum: either the cat comes with her or they break up. The author is considering responding with a counter-ultimatum.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, personal preferences about pets can be a big deal in relationships. The author has valid reasons based on his experiences. However, he's asking if it's unfair to not want the cat, which is part of her life. The girlfriend is standing her ground, so it's a conflict of values. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's being reasonable and not being cruel or unreasonable, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being inflexible, maybe he is. But the girlfriend is also not budging. The key here is whether his stance is a legitimate personal preference or if it's being used as a way to control the relationship. \n\nSince he's trying to communicate his needs and she's refusing to compromise, it's a mutual issue. He's not wrong for having a preference, especially if he's willing to make a compromise. However, suggesting a break-up ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But the girlfriend already gave an ultimatum, so maybe he's just responding in kind.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both need to find a middle ground. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but he might need to consider other solutions. Ultimately, the answer hinges on whether his stance is reasonable given his valid reasons. Since he's not being malicious and is trying to communicate, he's probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
