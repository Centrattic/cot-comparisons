I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend's cat to move in with them. The author is a dog person and really doesn't like cats, citing issues like the cat being annoying, causing scratches, and the general dislike for their behavior. The girlfriend is being very firm, saying they're a package deal and giving an ultimatum. The author is considering giving an ultimatum back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for not wanting the cat. They've had negative experiences with cats, find them difficult to train, and they cause them physical discomfort through scratches. The dog and the cat might not get along, which is a practical concern. But on the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat and is attached to it. She's given an ultimatum, which is pretty harsh, but the author is now considering matching her with their own ultimatum.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Personal preferences about pets can be a significant issue in relationships. If the author is upfront about their dislike for cats and the girlfriend insists on keeping them, it's a matter of compatibility. However, the author is not asking the girlfriend to give up the cat entirely, just that it not move in with them. The girlfriend is unwilling to compromise, which is a problem.\n\nBut does the author have the right to set this boundary? They are the ones who have to live with the situation, so their comfort and well-being matter. However, the way the author is handling it (considering an ultimatum) might be seen as equally harsh. The girlfriend's initial ultimatum was extreme, but the author's response could be seen as mirroring that. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for having this preference and potentially using an ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. If both parties are unwilling to bend, it might indicate deeper issues. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong because they are setting a boundary about their living space. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as playing hardball, especially if there's no room for discussion. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives (like the cat staying with her parents) is problematic, but the author's potential response could also be seen as equally rigid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate concern about their own comfort and the potential conflict between their dog and the cat. However, the way they're handling it (with an ultimatum) might be seen as harsh, especially if they could explore other solutions first. But given the girlfriend's unyielding stance, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer might hinge on whether the author's position is reasonable. Since personal preferences about pets are common, the author isn't wrong for having them. The girlfriend is being inflexible, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting the cat in their home.\n"
