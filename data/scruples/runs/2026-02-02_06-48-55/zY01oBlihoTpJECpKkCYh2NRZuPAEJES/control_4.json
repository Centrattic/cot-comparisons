I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her cat when they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a dog person and has strong negative feelings towards cats. He's had bad experiences with them, like scratches and bites, and finds them uncooperative. He's in a committed relationship, considering marriage, and wants to move in. His girlfriend is firm about keeping the cat, even giving an ultimatum if he can't accept it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has expressed his concerns, but his girlfriend isn't budging. He's now considering an ultimatum as well. The question is whether his stance is reasonable or if he's being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, personal preferences about pets are valid. Everyone has different boundaries. If the cat's presence causes significant stress or conflict, it's understandable he wants it not to be there. On the other hand, the girlfriend's attachment to the cat is also a valid concern. She might see the cat as family, and her response seems extreme, but relationships often require compromise.\n\nBut here, the girlfriend is holding the relationship hostage, which isn't healthy. However, the author is now considering doing the same by threatening to make her rehome the cat. The problem is, both sides are using ultimatums. The author's position might be justified if the cat's presence is causing real issues, but he should have tried to find a middle ground first. However, the girlfriend didn't compromise either. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since both parties are using ultimatums, maybe the blame isn't entirely on one side. But the author is standing by his preferences, which are legitimate. His approach of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he's considering playing hardball might be seen as equally harsh as her response. Yet, the initial problem is her refusal to negotiate. \n\nIn relationships, both people need to compromise. If she's unwilling to find a solution, maybe the author isn't wrong to set a boundary. The fact that the cat isn't problematic in terms of behavior (it's an average cat) but he has personal issues with cats in general might mean that his stance is based on personal dislike rather than the cat's behavior. That could tip the scale. However, if the cat's presence is causing him significant distress, that's a valid reason. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's setting a personal boundary, but there's a nuance. However, since his reasons are based on personal dislike rather than the cat being problematic, maybe it's harder to justify. But the girlfriend's ultimatum is also extreme. The author isn't wrong for having his preference, but maybe he should have tried harder to find a solution instead of going to an ultimatum. However, given that she refused to compromise, perhaps he's justified in his stance.\n"
