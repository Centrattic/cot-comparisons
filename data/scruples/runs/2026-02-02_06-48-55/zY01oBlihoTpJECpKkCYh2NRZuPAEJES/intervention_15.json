I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in. The main points are: he's a dog person, he dislikes cats, and his girlfriend is being very firm about the cat coming with her. She even gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: he doesn't like cats, has had negative experiences, and is worried about living with one. His dog is a big part of his life, and he's concerned about compatibility. On the other hand, the girlfriend has had the cat and is attached to it. She's not budging, which could be seen as inflexible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting the cat to not move in. The key here is whether his preference is unreasonable. People have different pet preferences, but if it's affecting the relationship, it's a problem. The girlfriend's response is pretty harsh, giving an ultimatum. But the author is also setting a boundary. \n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to rehome the cat? Maybe, but the way he's considering doing it (playing hardball) might be seen as equally harsh. However, the girlfriend's refusal to compromise could be the bigger issue. The author is trying to communicate his needs, but she's not willing to meet him halfway.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If one partner's needs are non-negotiable, it might lead to conflict. The author's stance is about his comfort and living situation, but the girlfriend's attachment to her pet is significant. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum seems extreme. The author isn't wrong to want to set a boundary, but maybe his approach could be more collaborative. Still, given her inflexibility, he's not in the wrong for standing his ground. So I think the answer is B.\n"
