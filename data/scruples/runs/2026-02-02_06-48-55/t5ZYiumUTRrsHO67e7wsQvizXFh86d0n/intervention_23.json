I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about personal choice versus a partner's opinion. The woman wants to change her hair for her own reasons\u2014she likes short hair, and the long hair is high maintenance. That seems like a valid personal preference. But her boyfriend is opposed to it, even comparing it to being less attracted if she gained weight, which is a bit of a problematic comparison. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is expressing his feelings, which is his right. But he's making it conditional on their relationship, which might not be fair. The woman is conflicted because she doesn't want to hurt his feelings but also wants to do what makes her happy. \n\nThe key points are: Is the woman required to prioritize her partner's preferences over her own? Does the boyfriend have a right to influence her appearance? In many relationships, personal autonomy is important. Unless there's a deeper issue like control or abuse, it's usually okay for someone to make their own choices, even if their partner doesn't like it. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since he's comparing it to weight gain, which is a sensitive topic. That might indicate he's not respecting her autonomy. The woman's decision to go through with the haircut could be seen as standing up for her own desires, which is a healthy aspect of a relationship. \n\nHowever, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. I need to check if there's a cultural or relational context I'm missing. But in general, unless there's an agreement to always agree on such matters, which isn't mentioned here, the woman isn't in the wrong for making a choice that's important to her. Breaking up over a haircut would be immature, but that's on the boyfriend, not the author. \n\nSo the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a personal choice and the boyfriend's disapproval shouldn't override her autonomy.\n"
