I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a woman who wants to get a pixie cut. She's been wanting this for a while because her current long hair is high maintenance and she prefers short hair. Her boyfriend, however, reacts negatively, saying he finds the pixie cut unattractive and that he'll be less attracted to her. She feels hurt because she wants to do something for herself but doesn't want to upset her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author has her own reason to get the haircut\u2014personal preference and practical reasons like maintenance. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his own attraction preferences. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for going through with the haircut despite his opinion.\n\nI remember that in relationships, autonomy is important. People should be able to make personal choices unless it directly harms the other person. The boyfriend is expressing his preference, but he's not saying it's an issue of respect or safety. The author is choosing her own style, which is a personal choice. However, she's also considering his feelings, not wanting to cause conflict. \n\nBut the boyfriend's comment about comparing it to his girlfriend getting fat is problematic. That comparison could be seen as disrespectful, implying that the author's choice is similar to gaining weight, which is a sensitive issue. This might indicate that the boyfriend has issues with his partner's autonomy or has a history of controlling behavior. \n\nThe author is conflicted because she wants to do something she likes but is worried about his reaction. The question is whether she's wrong for proceeding. Since the haircut is her own decision and she's not forced by societal norms or her partner's demands, I think she has the right to make this choice. The boyfriend's reaction is about his feelings, but the author's right to her own appearance should take precedence unless there's a deeper issue like abuse or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she's not considering his feelings enough, but the scenario shows that she's already aware of his dislike and is conflicted. The fact that she's seeking advice suggests she's trying to balance both perspectives. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal preference rather than a deal-breaker. Breaking up over a haircut is indeed immature, as the author notes. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to express herself through her appearance, even if it upsets her partner. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The boyfriend should respect her choice, and the author should be able to make her own decisions. Unless there's a pattern of controlling behavior, the author isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
