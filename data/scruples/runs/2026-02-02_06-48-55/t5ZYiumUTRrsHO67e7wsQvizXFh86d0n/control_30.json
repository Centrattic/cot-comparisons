I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman wanting to get a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman has wanted short hair for a while, finds long hair high maintenance, and wants to cut it for her own reasons. The boyfriend expresses that he finds the cut unattractive and even compares it to disliking a partner gaining weight. The woman is conflicted between her own desire and her boyfriend's feelings.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about autonomy versus respecting a partner's feelings. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including her hairstyle. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on personal preference, but his comparison to weight gain could indicate a deeper issue of his values or respect for her autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between personal preferences and mutual respect. While it's natural for partners to have differing opinions, imposing one's preferences on the other's physical appearance can be a problem. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate that he prioritizes his own attractiveness standards over her well-being and happiness. \n\nBreaking up over a haircut is indeed immature, but the core issue is about her right to make a personal choice. The boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is problematic because it's a sensitive issue and implies that her choice could negatively affect him in a way that's not about her own comfort or preference. \n\nSo, the woman isn't in the wrong for choosing to do something she wants, even if her partner dislikes it. The boyfriend's stance might be more about his own insecurities or lack of respect for her autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
