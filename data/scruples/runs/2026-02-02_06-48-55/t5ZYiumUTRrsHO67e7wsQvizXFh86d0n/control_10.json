I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman wanting to get a pixie cut despite her boyfriend not liking it. He says he finds it unattractive and that he won't be as attracted to her if she does it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman wants the haircut for personal reasons\u2014short hair suits her, is easier to maintain, and she likes how it looks. The boyfriend's reaction is negative, comparing it to if she were to gain weight. She's conflicted because she values his opinion but also her own desires.\n\nThe main issue here is autonomy versus the boyfriend's preference. In relationships, personal freedom is important. If a person has a valid reason to do something (like reducing maintenance, which is practical), they shouldn't have to conform solely to their partner's preferences. However, the boyfriend's reaction might indicate deeper issues, like controlling behavior or lack of respect for her autonomy. The comparison to weight gain is problematic because it's a sensitive topic and implies that his attraction is based on superficial standards.\n\nThe question is whether the woman is wrong for proceeding with the haircut. The answer hinges on whether personal choice overrides a partner's disapproval. Generally, individuals should be able to make decisions about their own bodies unless there's a mutual agreement or specific circumstances (like a betrothal agreement, which isn't the case here). The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own preferences, not a legitimate reason to restrict her choice.\n\nHowever, the woman is also considering the emotional impact. She's worried about his feelings but doesn't feel he has a right to dictate her choices. This is a common dilemma in relationships where personal freedom meets partner preferences. The key is that the decision should be hers, provided she communicates and ensures it's not a deal-breaker for him. If breaking up over it is too much, but he's not respecting her decision, that's a red flag on his part.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman isn't in the wrong for wanting to do what makes her happy, as long as it's her choice. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own insecurities or preferences, which shouldn't control her decisions. So the answer would be B (No). The AITA (Am I the Asshole) is usually a test of whether the person's actions are unreasonable. Here, the woman's choice is reasonable for her, so she's not the asshole.\n"
