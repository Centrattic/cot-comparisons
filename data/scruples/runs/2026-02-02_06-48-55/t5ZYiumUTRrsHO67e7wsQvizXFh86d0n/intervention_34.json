I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl wanting to get a pixie cut, but her boyfriend doesn't like it and says he finds it unattractive. She feels conflicted because she wants the haircut for personal reasons like maintenance and style, but she doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong if she goes through with the cut.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about personal autonomy and self-expression. She wants to do something she likes and finds practical. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is about his personal preferences and how it affects his attraction. But is his opinion a valid reason for her not to make the change?\n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's choices is important. If the boyfriend is expressing his opinion, but she's making a decision based on her own desires and practical needs, then she has the right to do that. However, the boyfriend's comparison to his girlfriend getting fat is problematic. Weight is different because it's a health and personal choice, but hair is a style choice. Using that comparison might indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the question is whether going ahead with the haircut makes her the \"asshole.\" If she communicates her decision clearly and both parties understand it's her choice, then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might affect the relationship, but it's not her fault for pursuing her own desires. Breaking up over this is on the boyfriend, not her. So the answer is likely B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
