I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) subreddit, so the community usually weighs in on whether the person's actions are reasonable or if they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, the author wants a pixie cut because she loves short hair and finds her long hair too high maintenance. She mentions it's been an issue with tangling, etc. So her reasons are personal and practical. Her boyfriend expressed that he finds it unattractive and would be less attracted to her if she changes her hair. He even compared it to his girlfriend getting fat, which is a bit of a harsh analogy. The author is conflicted because she wants the haircut but doesn't want to hurt her boyfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy, respect, and communication. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. The boyfriend's opinion is valid, but he can't dictate her choices. The comparison to weight might be problematic because that's a more personal and health-related issue, whereas hairstyle is a conscious choice. The author is considering the impact on their relationship but isn't sure if going through with the cut is wrong.\n\nThe dilemma is whether respecting her own desires outweighs her partner's preferences. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's choices is important. If the boyfriend is making her feel bad for wanting to change her hair, that's a red flag. The author isn't forcing the breakup; she's weighing if her action is justified. The community often sides with people who prioritize their own well-being and autonomy, unless the action is harmful. Since a haircut is reversible and her reasons are valid, she's probably not in the wrong. But some might argue that considering his feelings is important. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems to overstep by comparing it to something as significant as weight, and the author's right to her own style is a strong point.\n"
