I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. First, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe author has wanted a short haircut for a while, citing practical reasons like maintenance and personal preference. Her boyfriend expressed that he finds short hair unattractive and said he'll be less attracted to her if she cuts it. He also used a comparison to getting fat, which is a sensitive issue. \n\nNow, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are personal autonomy versus a partner's opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his personal preference, which is valid, but it's also important that the author is making a choice that affects her own happiness and comfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's comparison to weight is problematic because attractiveness based on weight can be more about health and personal choice in a different context. However, the key here is that the author is making a decision for herself. \n\nIn relationships, partners often have to respect each other's choices, especially when those choices don't harm the other person. The author isn't doing something harmful; she's changing her appearance to suit her preferences. The boyfriend's disapproval might affect their relationship dynamics, but the author has the right to her own style. \n\nBreaking up over this might be an overreaction, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for pursuing her own desires, even if it upsets her boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of support, but that's on him, not the author. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice that's important to her.\n"
