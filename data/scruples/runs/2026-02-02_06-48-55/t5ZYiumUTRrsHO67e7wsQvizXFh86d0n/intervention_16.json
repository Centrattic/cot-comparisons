I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl wanting a pixie cut, but her boyfriend is upset and finds it unattractive. She's conflicted between her desire for the haircut and not wanting to hurt his feelings. The question is whether she's at fault if she goes through with the haircut.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is autonomy versus the boyfriend's feelings. The girl has a legitimate reason to want the haircut\u2014personal preference, maintenance issues, and it's something she's wanted for a while. On the other hand, the boyfriend is expressing discomfort and even using a comparison to weight gain, which is a sensitive topic. That comparison might be problematic because body image issues can sometimes be more complex and stigmatized.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of support for her personal choice. The fact that he uses a disgusted tone and focuses on attractiveness could suggest that his feelings are more about his own preferences than genuine concern for her well-being. The girl isn't harming herself by getting a haircut; it's about her self-expression and comfort. If the relationship can't support her in such a personal decision, that might reflect deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the girl is also considering his feelings and trying to balance her desire with his. She's not being inconsiderate but is weighing both sides. The question is whether her going through with the haircut makes her at fault. Since she's making a decision based on her own needs and the boyfriend's reaction is about his personal preference, she's not necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is a red flag, as it's a sensitive and often unhealthy comparison. That might indicate that the real issue is his views on attractiveness rather than the haircut itself.\n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between personal autonomy and mutual respect. The girl has a right to her own appearance choices. If the boyfriend can't support that, it might be a sign of a deeper problem, but the act of getting a haircut isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's an expectation of compromise or if the boyfriend's feelings are a valid reason for her to change her mind. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not whether the relationship is healthy. So, the answer would be B (No) because she's making a personal choice that's important to her, and the boyfriend's disapproval doesn't make her wrong. Her decision isn't malicious; it's about her own happiness and practicality.\n"
