I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman wanting to get a pixie cut, but her boyfriend doesn't like it and says it's unattractive. The author is conflicted because she wants the haircut for her own reasons but is worried about her boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to do something for herself\u2014short hair is more manageable and she likes the look. The boyfriend expressed his dislike, but she's the one who has to live with her appearance. The key point here is about autonomy versus respect for her partner's feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is strong, even comparing her choice to gaining weight, which is a sensitive issue. That might be a red flag because comparing someone's choice to a personal appearance issue like weight gain can be dismissive and hurtful. The author might feel pressured into not doing something she wants because of her partner's preference, which could be a sign of a controlling dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override the author's own desires and needs. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices, even if they don't agree. The author isn't obligated to change her appearance to please her partner. The question is whether the author is wrong for proceeding with the haircut despite her boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. I need to evaluate if the boyfriend's disapproval is a valid reason for her to not get the haircut. Since the author has her own reasons and the boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his preferences rather than something harmful to her, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision that's right for herself. The real issue might be the boyfriend's handling of the situation, not the author's choice to act on her own wishes.\n"
