I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who wants to get a pixie cut, but her boyfriend doesn't like it and says he'll find her less attractive. She's conflicted because she wants the haircut for her own reasons but doesn't want to make her boyfriend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The woman has her own reasons for wanting the haircut: maintenance issues, personal preference, etc. The boyfriend is expressing his dislike and comparing it to if she got fat, which is a problematic comparison. The woman is torn between her desire and her partner's feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong for going through with the haircut despite his objections.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about others' opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider autonomy and personal choice. In a healthy relationship, a person should be able to make decisions about their own body without pressure from their partner. The boyfriend's reaction seems controlling, especially using the comparison to weight gain, which is a sensitive and unfair analogy. His reaction is about his attraction, but she's making a choice that affects her own life. Breaking up over this is indeed immature, but the decision to cut her hair is hers to make. \n\nThe woman isn't obligated to cater to her boyfriend's preferences. Her right to self-expression and practical needs (like hair maintenance) should be respected. The boyfriend isn't happy, but she's not required to change her decision based on his feelings alone. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing her own style. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
