I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman wanting to get a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. The boyfriend is upset and says it's unattractive, even comparing it to his reaction if she gained weight. The author is conflicted because she wants the hair she likes but doesn't want to hurt her partner's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman has wanted a short hair for a while, her current hair is long and high maintenance. She made an appointment to cut it. The boyfriend reacts negatively, says he'll be less attracted to her, uses a disgusted tone, and compares it to weight gain. The author is wondering if she's at fault for going through with the haircut.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. In a relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices and autonomy. While the boyfriend's feelings are important, he's expressing disapproval in a way that's hurtful. Comparing a haircut to weight gain is problematic because weight gain can have health implications, but a haircut is a personal choice about appearance. The boyfriend's reaction seems to prioritize his own preferences over her autonomy and well-being.\n\nThe author's reasons for cutting her hair are valid: she loves short hair, it's easier to maintain, and she's tired of dealing with long hair's issues. She's not doing this to upset her partner, but because it's what she wants. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of support or insecurity, but that doesn't justify controlling her choices. \n\nBreaking up over this seems extreme, but if the boyfriend's behavior is dismissive and controlling, it might indicate deeper issues. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her hair. Since she's making a personal choice and the boyfriend's reaction is about his own feelings, she isn't in the wrong for asserting her autonomy. The boyfriend's disapproval isn't a valid reason for her to change her decision unless there was mutual agreement beforehand, which there doesn't seem to be.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that's important to her, and while the boyfriend's feelings are a factor, they shouldn't override her personal wishes. The key is mutual respect versus one-sided control.\n"
