I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. The situation is that the boyfriend finds the cut unattractive and expressed his dislike, even comparing it to his girlfriend getting fat. The author wants the cut for her own reasons: she likes short hair, finds long hair too high maintenance, and she's been wanting it for a while.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal autonomy versus the boyfriend's feelings. The author has her own reasons for wanting the haircut, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction is hurtful, especially the comparison to getting fat, which is a sensitive topic and can be triggering. That comparison might indicate a lack of respect for her choice.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's individuality. If one partner wants to make a change that affects their appearance, unless it's something that directly impacts the other in a significant way (like a major life decision), it's usually their right to do so. The boyfriend's disapproval shouldn't override her personal choice. However, the author is also considering her partner's feelings, which shows she cares about the relationship.\n\nBut the key here is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal preferences rather than something harmful. The author is not forcing him to like it; she's making a choice that's important to her. Unless there's an agreement about such decisions, she shouldn't be blamed for it. The boyfriend's comparison is problematic, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for getting the cut. She's prioritizing her own needs and preferences, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to make decisions about her own body and appearance, even if it upsets her partner. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own attraction and lack of support, but that doesn't make her choice wrong.\n"
