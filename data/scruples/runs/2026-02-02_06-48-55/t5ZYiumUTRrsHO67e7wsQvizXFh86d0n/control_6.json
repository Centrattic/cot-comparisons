I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite their boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman wants a pixie cut for personal reasons\u2014she loves short hair, finds long hair high maintenance, and has wanted this for a while. The boyfriend expresses that he finds the cut unattractive and might not be as attracted to her after the change. The woman is conflicted between her desire and his feelings, considering if breaking up over it is immature.\n\nI need to determine if she's in the wrong. The main factors are autonomy vs. relationship dynamics. She has her own reasons and preferences, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction is about his personal attraction, which is subjective. However, his comparison to weight gain is problematic because that's a more sensitive issue, implying that attractiveness is a factor in his feelings towards her. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both parties should respect each other's choices unless there's a deeper issue. The boyfriend's disapproval here is about an aesthetic preference. The woman has the right to make decisions about her body. If the relationship can't handle such differences, maybe there are underlying issues. The question is whether the act of getting the haircut makes her the \"asshole.\" Since it's her choice and she's not forcing him to accept it, but also not ignoring his feelings by going through with it, the answer hinges on personal autonomy versus relationship harmony. \n\nBut the boyfriend's comparison to weight gain might indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy, similar to how weight gain is a personal choice and health issue, not just aesthetics. So his reaction is part of the problem here. Therefore, the woman is not in the wrong for making a choice about her own appearance. The boyfriend's stance is more about his preferences, but she's entitled to her decision. So the answer is B (No).\n"
