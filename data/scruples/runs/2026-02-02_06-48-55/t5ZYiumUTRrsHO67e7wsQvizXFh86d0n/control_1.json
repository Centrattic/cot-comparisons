I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's objections.\n\nFirst, the main points here are autonomy and self-expression versus the boyfriend's feelings. The author wants a haircut she likes and finds practical. She's tired of long hair's maintenance issues. The boyfriend doesn't find short hair attractive and compares it to disliking weight gain, which might be an unfair comparison. \n\nThe key here is personal choice. People should have the right to make their own decisions about their body and appearance, even if a partner disagrees. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on personal preference, not something harmful. The author is considering the impact on their relationship, but breaking up over a haircut seems extreme. \n\nThe boyfriend's comment about comparing it to weight gain is problematic because it's not the same. Body image issues are more complex and can involve health, but hair length is a style choice. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to like it, just doing what she wants. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her own desires and practicality. The boyfriend needs to accept her choices, and if that's a deal-breaker, maybe the relationship has deeper issues. But the author isn't doing anything wrong by going through with her decision.\n"
