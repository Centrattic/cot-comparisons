I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person wants a pixie cut, but their boyfriend doesn't like it and expressed that he finds it unattractive. The author is conflicted between their own desire for the haircut and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has wanted a short haircut for a while, citing practical reasons like maintenance and personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is negative, even using a comparison to weight gain, which is a sensitive topic. The author is conflicted because they don't want to do something that upsets their partner but also feels it's their own choice.\n\nThe key here is autonomy versus relationship expectations. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body. The boyfriend's preference for their partner's appearance shouldn't dictate the author's choices. However, the author is also considering their partner's feelings, which is a responsible approach. The boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is problematic because it's not a parallel situation\u2014body image and personal style are different. Weight gain is a natural occurrence, while a haircut is a choice. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about personal preference rather than a deal-breaker.\n\nBreaking up over a haircut is indeed immature, but the author is still considering whether to go through with the cut. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding. Since the author's reasons are valid and their own autonomy is at stake, they are not in the wrong. The boyfriend's disapproval doesn't override the author's right to choose their appearance. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
