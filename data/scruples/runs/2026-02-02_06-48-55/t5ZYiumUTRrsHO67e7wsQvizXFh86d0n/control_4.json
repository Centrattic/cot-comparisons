I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman wanting to get a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The woman wants a haircut she likes, finds it more practical, and is tired of long hair's maintenance. Her boyfriend is upset, says he'll find her less attractive, and even compares it to gaining weight. The woman is conflicted because she doesn't want to hurt him but also wants her own style.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus the boyfriend's feelings. She has her own reasons for wanting the haircut, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his preferences, but comparing a hairstyle to weight gain might be problematic. His comment could imply that he's objectifying her, which is a red flag.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong to proceed. The woman's right to make decisions about her own body is important. Unless there's a mutual agreement about such changes, she shouldn't be blamed for acting on her own desires. The boyfriend's reaction is about his preferences, not her right to express herself. \n\nAlso, the user mentions breaking up over it being trivial. The woman isn't breaking up, but she's conflicted. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate deeper issues about control or insecurity, but the question is about the woman's action. Since she's choosing to do what she wants and isn't forcing the relationship, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
