I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman wants a short haircut for her own reasons: she loves how it looks and finds long hair too high maintenance. She's made an appointment. Her boyfriend expresses that he finds the cut unattractive and that he'd be less attracted to her if she does it. She's conflicted because she wants the cut but doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong if she goes through with the cut.\n\nThe main points here are autonomy versus relationship dynamics. The woman has her own desires and reasons for wanting the haircut. The boyfriend's reaction is about his personal preference regarding her appearance. The key issue is whether she's obligated to conform to his preferences in this matter.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have different preferences. However, unless there's a deeper issue like control or manipulation, personal style choices are generally an individual's right. The boyfriend's comparison to his girlfriend getting fat is problematic because it implies that her attractiveness is tied to his standards, which can be a form of objectification. That's a red flag.\n\nThe woman is prioritizing her own happiness and self-expression. While she's considering her boyfriend's feelings, the core of the matter is her right to make decisions about her own body. Unless there's a mutual agreement about such things, she isn't in the wrong for following through with a decision that's important to her. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own preferences, not something that justifies her being in the wrong. The fact that he's using his attraction as a reason to discourage her might indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy, which is an issue in the relationship, but not the woman's fault.\n"
