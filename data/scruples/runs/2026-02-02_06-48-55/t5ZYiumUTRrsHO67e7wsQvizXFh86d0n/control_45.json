I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman wanting to get a pixie cut despite her boyfriend disapproving and finding it unattractive. She's conflicted because she wants the haircut for personal reasons and practicality but doesn't want to hurt his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman's reasons for the haircut are personal and practical: she loves short hair, her current long hair is high maintenance, and she wants to change her look. On the other hand, the boyfriend is expressing his preference and stating that he finds short hair unattractive. He even compares it to his girlfriend getting fat, which is a problematic analogy because body image issues are more complex and sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus partner's opinion. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems to dismiss her desires and prioritize his own preferences. The comparison he makes is also a red flag because it's a different type of change with different implications. Weight gain is a health and personal choice issue, while a haircut is a personal style choice that doesn't affect health. So his analogy is flawed.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for going through with the haircut. If the boyfriend is expressing disapproval but hasn't communicated any deeper issues, like controlling behavior or lack of respect, then the woman isn't in the wrong for making a choice that's important to her. Breaking up over this might be extreme, but the main issue is about personal autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own preferences not being respected rather than any serious ethical wrongdoing by the woman.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a personal choice, and her partner needs to respect that unless there's a deeper issue of control or abuse, which isn't indicated here.\n"
