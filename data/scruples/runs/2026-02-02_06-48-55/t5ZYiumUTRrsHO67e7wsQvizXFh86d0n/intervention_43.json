I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. The person wants the haircut because she likes it and finds long hair too high maintenance. The boyfriend is upset, saying he finds short hair unattractive and compares it to disliking if his girlfriend gained weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is making a personal choice about her appearance, which is her right. She's not forcing the boyfriend to like it, just doing what makes her happy. On the other hand, the boyfriend is expressing his feelings, which is also valid. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his personal preference. The comparison to weight gain is a bit problematic because weight is a different issue\u2014body image can be sensitive, but hair length is a style choice. However, the boyfriend's reaction might indicate deeper issues, like valuing his opinion over her happiness or having a lack of support for her autonomy.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she wants to do this for herself but is worried about his feelings. However, she's also considering the impact on their relationship. The key here is that personal autonomy and self-expression are important. Unless the boyfriend is pressuring her to change for his sake, she's within her rights to make this choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's disapproval might suggest that he's not supportive of her desires, which could be a red flag for the relationship. But the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own happiness. Getting a haircut is a personal decision, and relationships should ideally allow mutual respect for each other's preferences unless there's a deeper issue of control or coercion.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life and well-being. The boyfriend's reaction is his issue to deal with, not her fault. Unless there's an agreement about appearances (which isn't mentioned), she's not obligated to change for him.\n"
