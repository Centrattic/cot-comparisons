I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl wanting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author really wants a short haircut for personal reasons\u2014maintenance, style, and personal preference. The boyfriend expresses that he finds it unattractive and it might affect his attraction, which upsets her.\n\nI think the key here is autonomy. People have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The boyfriend's opinion is valid, but he can't dictate what the author does with her hair. It's her choice. However, the author is also considering her partner's feelings, which shows consideration. \n\nThe boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is a bit problematic. Weight is a different issue, but the point is that personal preferences should be respected. If the relationship is about mutual respect, then the author shouldn't be in the wrong for wanting a haircut she likes. \n\nBreaking up over this seems extreme, but the author isn't wrong for choosing her preference. The boyfriend needs to accept her choice or maybe it's a sign of deeper issues. So the answer is B.\n"
