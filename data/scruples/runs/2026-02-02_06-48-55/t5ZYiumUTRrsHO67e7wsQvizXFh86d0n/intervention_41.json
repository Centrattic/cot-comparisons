I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person is a woman who wants to get a pixie cut. She's had long hair for a while and finds it high maintenance. Her boyfriend doesn't like the idea and says he'll find her less attractive with short hair. They compare it to if he got fat, which he wouldn't like. She's conflicted because she wants the haircut but doesn't want to make him unhappy. She's wondering if she's in the wrong for going through with the cut.\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue here: personal autonomy versus a partner's preferences. The author wants to make a change about her own body, which is her right. However, the boyfriend's reaction is negative, even to the point of expressing disgust. That's a strong reaction and might indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding with the haircut despite his disapproval.\n\nPersonal autonomy is important. People have the right to make decisions about their own appearance. If the boyfriend is being dismissive or disrespectful, that's a problem. However, if the relationship relies on mutual respect and the boyfriend is expressing his feelings without being abusive, there's a balance to consider. The author does mention that she wants to be considerate of his feelings but also her own needs.\n\nThe comparison he makes to getting fat is problematic. Weight is a body image issue, but it's different from a haircut. The comparison might be invalidating her desire because it's not the same. Also, the fact that he's using a hypothetical scenario where she gets fat to justify his feelings about her haircut is a bit concerning. It might show a lack of understanding or support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is aware that her decision will affect her boyfriend's feelings. She's weighing her own desires against his feelings, which is a mature approach. She's not forcing the issue but is considering his perspective. However, her own needs and happiness are also valid. If the relationship is based on mutual respect, then she should be able to make this decision without feeling guilty.\n\nAnother angle is the breakup comparison. She mentions that breaking up over a haircut is trivial, which suggests she doesn't think it's a dealbreaker. But if the boyfriend is so invested in her appearance in a way that it affects his attraction, it might be a red flag about his values or insecurity. However, that's more about the relationship's health than whether she's in the wrong for cutting her hair.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) She's making a decision about her own body. 2) The boyfriend is expressing disapproval but not outright abuse. 3) The comparison to weight is problematic. 4) She's trying to balance both her needs and his feelings.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, I don't think she is. She has the right to her own choice. The boyfriend's reaction is his issue to deal with, and while she's being considerate, she shouldn't have to sacrifice her own preferences entirely. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
