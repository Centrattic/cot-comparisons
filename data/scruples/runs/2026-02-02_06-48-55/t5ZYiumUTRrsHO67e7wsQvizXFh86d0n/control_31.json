I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. First, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe author wants a haircut she's been desiring for a while. She mentions practical reasons like maintenance and personal preference. Her boyfriend is upset, says he finds short hair unattractive, and compares it to if his girlfriend got fat. The main issue is whether she's prioritizing her own desires over his feelings, but also whether his reaction is valid.\n\nI should think about personal autonomy versus relationships. People have the right to make choices about their body, right? But in a relationship, communication is important. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his personal preference, which is valid, but he's making a value judgment about her appearance affecting his attraction. Comparing it to weight gain is a red flag because body shaming is never okay. \n\nThe author is conflicted because she doesn't want to make him upset, but also wants to do what's right for herself. Breaking up over a haircut seems extreme, but if respect and communication are lacking, maybe there are deeper issues. The question is whether the author is wrong for going through with the cut. Since she's making a choice about her own body and the boyfriend's objection is based on aesthetics, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's comparison is problematic, but the decision to cut her hair is her own. So answer B.\n"
