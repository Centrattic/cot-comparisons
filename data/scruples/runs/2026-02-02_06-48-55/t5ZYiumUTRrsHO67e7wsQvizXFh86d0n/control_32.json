I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend not liking it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman wants a short haircut for personal reasons: she loves the look and finds long hair too high maintenance. Her boyfriend expresses that he finds the style unattractive and gets upset. The key points here are autonomy versus a partner's feelings.\n\nShe mentions that breaking up over the haircut seems immature, but she also values her own desire. The boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is problematic because it's not equivalent. Weight gain is a natural part of life and not a choice like a haircut. His reaction might indicate a lack of support or respect for her autonomy.\n\nPersonal choice in appearance is a fundamental right. While relationships involve compromise, there's a difference between respecting each other's preferences and making unilateral decisions. The boyfriend's disgust and the implication that her attractiveness depends on his preferences is concerning. Healthy relationships should allow each person to express their individuality without pressure.\n\nHowever, the woman is also considering her partner's feelings. She doesn't want to hurt him intentionally, which shows she's trying to balance both her needs and his. But if his reaction is extreme and dismissive, it might indicate deeper issues in the relationship, like lack of support or unrealistic expectations.\n\nThe AITA format usually looks for whether the person asking did something wrong. In this case, the woman is acting on her own desire, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his personal preference, which isn't a strong enough reason to prevent her from making a choice about her own body. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
