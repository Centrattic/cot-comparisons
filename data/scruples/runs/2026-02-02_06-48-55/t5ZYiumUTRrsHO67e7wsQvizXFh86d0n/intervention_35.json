I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA question). The situation involves a girlfriend cutting her hair in a style her boyfriend dislikes.\n\nFirst, the main points: The woman wants a pixie cut for practical and personal reasons. She loves short hair and finds long hair too high-maintenance. Her boyfriend expressed his dislike, comparing it to disliking weight gain, which he finds unattractive. She's conflicted because she wants to do it but doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The question is if she's in the wrong for going through with the haircut despite his opinion.\n\nNow, considering personal autonomy versus relationship dynamics. In relationships, personal choices can sometimes clash with a partner's preferences. The key factors here are: her right to make her own decisions about her body, the validity of her reasons (practical and personal style), and whether the boyfriend's reaction is overly controlling or respectful.\n\nThe boyfriend's comparison to disliking weight gain might indicate a problem. Weight is a sensitive topic and using that as a comparison could be seen as invalidating. It might suggest that he's making her self-image dependent on his preferences, which isn't healthy. However, if the boyfriend is honest about his preferences without pressuring her, he's in his rights to express that.\n\nThe woman's reasons for cutting her hair are legitimate. She values her personal style and practicality. Choosing to prioritize her own desires is a personal right. The issue here is whether she's being inconsiderate by not considering his feelings, or if he's being overbearing by trying to influence her choice.\n\nIn many relationships, it's expected that partners respect each other's autonomy. If the boyfriend is respecting her decision even if he's unhappy, that's different. But if he's trying to control her choices, that's a problem. However, the scenario states that she's aware of his feelings but still wants to proceed, which is her prerogative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the woman isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice about her own body and style, and while her boyfriend's feelings are valid, they shouldn't dictate her decision. The key is that she's not forcing him to accept it or disrespecting him, just making a personal choice. The boyfriend's reaction might be an issue in the relationship, but the woman isn't at fault here.\n"
