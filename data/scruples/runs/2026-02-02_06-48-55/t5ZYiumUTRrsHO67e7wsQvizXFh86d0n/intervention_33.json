I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a pixie cut despite her boyfriend's disapproval. She mentions her own desire for the haircut due to maintenance issues and personal preference. The boyfriend expressed that he finds the cut unattractive and even compared it to his reaction if she gained weight, which she found hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman has a valid reason for wanting the haircut: it's high maintenance and she prefers short hair. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his personal preferences. The question is about whether her decision is wrong in this context.\n\nThe key points to consider are autonomy versus partner's preferences. In relationships, individuals should have the right to make personal choices, especially those that affect their own bodies. The boyfriend's comparison to weight gain is problematic because it's a sensitive issue and implies that her appearance could decrease his attraction, which can be harmful. However, the author is conflicted because she doesn't want to hurt her partner's feelings but also wants to do what's best for herself.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the author is making a choice for herself, even though it goes against her partner's preference, it's more about personal autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own taste, which shouldn't dictate her choices unless there's a deeper issue of respect or control. The author isn't forcing him to like it; she's choosing to do what she wants despite his dislike. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
