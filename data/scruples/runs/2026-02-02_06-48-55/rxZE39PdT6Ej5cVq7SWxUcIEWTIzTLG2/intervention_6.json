      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery) to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but they're in the US now and pay with a card, so they don't tip. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. From what I know, in the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically 15-20%, and it's usually expected even when paying by card. The author is from a country where 10% is standard, but they might not realize that the US standard is higher. However, the author is aware that the total cost is high, which might be influencing their decision not to tip. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're a student with limited funds and that the cost, including delivery, is too much. They might feel that the delivery fee is already part of the total, so they don't need to add a tip. But in the US, the delivery fee is separate from the tip, and the tip is expected to compensate the delivery person for their service. \n\nThe key points here are the cultural expectation versus the individual's personal financial situation. The author might be justifying not tipping due to cost, but in the US context, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. However, some might argue that if the service is poor, not tipping is acceptable. But the post doesn't mention the quality of service, just the cost. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the standard in the US is to tip for delivery, then not tipping could be seen as wrong, regardless of the individual's financial situation. However, the author might be unaware of the US tipping culture. On the other hand, if they are aware but choose not to tip to save money, that could be seen as wrong. The author's post might be seeking validation for their decision based on their own country's norms, but in the US, the expectation is different. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're not following the US tipping customs, even if they're from a country with different practices.\n"
