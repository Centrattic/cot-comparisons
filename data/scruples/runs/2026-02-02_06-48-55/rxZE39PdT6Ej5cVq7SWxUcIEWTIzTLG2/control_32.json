      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention in their country they tip 10%, but in the US, they're unsure. The question is whether not tipping is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary, typically 15-20% for services like delivery. However, if you pay by card, some places allow adding a tip automatically, but maybe the user didn't do that. The user says they paid with a card and didn't tip. \n\nBut the user is from a country where they tip 10%, which is different. So maybe they're confused because they're not used to the US norms. Also, they mention the total cost is high, so maybe they feel it's an extra burden. However, in the US, delivery fees and tips are separate. The delivery fee is part of the restaurant's cost, and the tip is for the delivery person's service. \n\nThe user didn't tip, but is that wrong? Well, if the user is following their home country's practice, but in the US, it's expected. However, there's no legal obligation, so maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But culturally, it's considered rude not to tip. However, the user's reasoning is about financial constraints. \n\nBut the user is a student with limited money. The question is whether that justifies not tipping. Some might argue that even a small tip is appreciated. Others might say that if you can't afford to tip, maybe you shouldn't order the food. However, the user is in a position where they need to prioritize their expenses. \n\nSo, the answer depends on cultural expectations versus personal circumstances. Since the user is in the US, the expectation is to tip. Not tipping could be seen as wrong. But the user might not be aware of the US norms. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn the US, if you don't tip, it's generally frowned upon, especially since delivery drivers rely on tips. So the answer might be A (they're wrong). But considering their financial situation and cultural background, maybe B (not wrong) is acceptable. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if they're in the wrong. If they paid with a card, maybe they didn't know how to tip. Some apps require you to tip via the app, but if they didn't, maybe they just didn't. However, if they intentionally chose not to tip, that's different. \n\nIn the US, not tipping is considered rude and unfair to the worker. So, even if it's not illegal, morally, the user is in the wrong. So answer A. But the user's argument is about financial constraints. However, the user is choosing to order food despite the high cost, which includes the delivery fee. Not tipping is an additional choice. \n\nSo the answer might be A, but there's a counterargument. However, the community on AITA often considers the worker's perspective. So the answer would be A. The user is in the wrong for not tipping, even if they're in a tight spot. Because the delivery person's income depends on tips. \n\nBut the user is a student with limited funds. Maybe the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong because they can't afford it. However, the AITA subreddit often sides with the person who didn't tip if they have a valid reason, like not knowing the norms. But in this case, the user says they know their country tips 10%, but not sure about the US. So maybe they're unaware. \n\nBut if they paid with a card, they might have had the option to tip. So maybe the answer is A. The user is in the wrong because they had the means (the card) to tip but chose not to. \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. The final answer depends on cultural expectations vs. personal circumstances. I think in the US context, not tipping is considered wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
