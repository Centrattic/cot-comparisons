      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and feels that the total cost including delivery is too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with a card, they don't leave a tip because it's not as straightforward as giving cash change. The main question is whether they're wrong for not tipping in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, especially in the food industry, and it's often expected. The standard tip is typically around 15-20%, though some might leave 10% in certain situations. Delivery drivers, like other service workers, rely on tips as part of their income because their base pay might be lower. \n\nThe author is using a card, so they don't have the option to leave cash, which might make it easier to forget or neglect the tip. However, in the US, when paying by card, it's common for the tip to be added at the point of payment, sometimes automatically. The author could have manually added a tip even when paying by card. The fact that the total feels high doesn't absolve them from the social expectation of tipping.\n\nThe cost of the meal and delivery might be a factor in the author's decision, but that doesn't mean they should skip the tip. Even small tips can add up for delivery drivers. The author's reasoning is based on their own financial constraints and their home country's practices, but they are in the US where norms differ. \n\nHowever, some might argue that students with limited funds shouldn't be expected to tip as much, especially if they're not used to the practice. But the general consensus in the US is that tipping is part of the service cost, so not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate to the worker. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as not adhering to local customs, thus putting them in the wrong. But there's also a counterargument that the system should be more accommodating for people in different financial situations. However, the question is about fault, not the system. The author has the choice to tip, even if it's a small amount. Therefore, the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
