      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally but usually cooks, and when they do order, they find the total (including delivery fee) to be high for the amount of food. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they pay by card, they don't tip, and now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The idea is that tips supplement their income, as their base pay might be lower. Even with card payments, most people still tip through the app or add a gratuity. The author is paying with a card, so maybe they think they don't have to tip because there's no cash to give change from. However, the expectation in the US is that you tip regardless of payment method. \n\nThe author's argument is that they don't have much money and the total seems high. But the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The fee covers the logistics of delivery, while the tip is for the driver's service. Even if the food is cheap, the driver still has to work, so not tipping might be seen as unfair. However, the author's financial situation is a factor. They're a student on a budget, so maybe they're justifying not tipping because they can't afford it. \n\nNow, in their country, tipping 10% when paying cash is standard, but in the US, the norm is higher, typically 15-20% for good service. But the author isn't even tipping 10% here. Since they pay by card, they might not realize that they can still add a tip through the payment process. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The answer hinges on cultural expectations and the ability to tip. If the author is in the US, not tipping at all could be seen as wrong because it's expected. However, if they're genuinely unable to afford it, that's a mitigating factor. The post doesn't specify their location, but they mentioned the US in the question, so we can assume they're in the US. \n\nTherefore, even though the author is in a tight financial situation, the expectation in the US is that you tip delivery drivers regardless of payment method. So, the author might be considered in the wrong for not tipping. However, the argument could be made that they're a student with limited funds and might not be aware of the US tipping norms. But since they mentioned knowing about 10% in their country, maybe they should know that in the US it's higher and still expected. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the community's view is that tipping is a basic expectation regardless of payment method, then yes. If they consider the financial hardship and lack of knowledge, maybe not. But the answer should be based on typical US standards. So, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because not tipping a delivery driver in the US is generally considered inappropriate unless there's a specific issue with the service. The author's financial situation is a factor but doesn't absolve them of the cultural expectation.\n"
