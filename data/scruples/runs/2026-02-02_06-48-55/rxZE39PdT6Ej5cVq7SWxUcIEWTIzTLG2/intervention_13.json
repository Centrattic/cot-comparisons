AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery) high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying by card, they don't tip because they usually do when paying cash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20% if paying cash, but some places might automatically add a tip when using a card. However, the user might not be aware of this. Also, the user is a student with limited funds, which could be a mitigating factor. \n\nThe delivery fee might be separate from the tip, so the user's total being $19 could be due to delivery fees plus the actual food cost. The user might not realize that delivery drivers rely on tips as a significant part of their income. Even if the user is in a different country where tipping is 10%, the US is different. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the US context. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if they're in the wrong despite the financial constraints. While it's understandable to be tight on money, the expectation in the US for delivery tips is different. So even if the user didn't have a lot, maybe a small tip is expected. But if they paid by card and didn't include a tip, that's where the issue lies. The user might not know that in the US, tipping via card is also expected. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user is a student and can't afford to tip, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the question is about right and wrong in the US tipping culture. The user's reasoning is that in their country, it's 10%, but they don't tip when using a card. However, in the US, if you pay by card, some platforms might still expect you to add a tip, even if it's automatic. So not tipping could be seen as wrong here. \n\nBut the user's financial situation is a factor. They might not have the means to tip. Is it acceptable to not tip because of financial constraints? That's debatable. The user is trying to save money, but the delivery driver relies on tips. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the cultural expectation is to tip, even if it's a small amount. However, if the user is genuinely unable to tip beyond the base payment, maybe they aren't. But the question is about being in the wrong according to social norms. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that the user is in the wrong because not tipping in the US for delivery is expected even if using a card. The user's financial situation is a mitigating factor but not an excuse. So answer A.\n"
