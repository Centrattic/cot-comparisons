      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery fee high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which they're questioning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author comes from a country where 10% is typical, but in the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even if they pay with a card, not tipping might be seen as not following local customs. However, the author is in a financial situation where they can't afford it, which adds context. \n\nOn one hand, not tipping could be seen as not respecting the service, so the author might be in the wrong. On the other hand, their financial constraints are real, and maybe they didn't realize the expectation in the US is different. Tipping isn't mandatory, but it's expected. So the author might not be in the wrong if they didn't know, but if they knew and chose not to, maybe they are. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer could be nuanced, but since the user thinks they are in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I should check if there's a standard here. In the US, even with a card, you can tip, so the author could have added a tip. Not doing so might be seen as not following etiquette, hence A. But if they didn't know, maybe B. The author says they don't tip when paying with card, so maybe they didn't know the expectation. So maybe B is the answer. Hmm. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the information. The key points: author didn't tip, but the cost is high. The US typically expects a tip, even with card. So not tipping is against the norm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
