AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a student who orders food occasionally. They're concerned about not tipping the delivery guy when paying by card. They mention paying $19 for ramen noodles, which seems expensive to them considering the delivery fee. They also note that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash.\n\nSeveral factors stand out:\n\n1. The author is clearly struggling financially as a student.\n2. They're concerned about tipping but don't know US standards.\n3. They're paying with a card, which might make tipping less immediate.\n4. The total cost seems high to them for what they're getting.\n\nIn the US, while there are no strict rules, tipping is often expected for delivery services, typically 10-15%. However, the expectation varies depending on the situation. Given the author's financial limitations and lack of familiarity with local customs, their hesitation makes sense. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate - they're aware of tipping norms and are trying to navigate unfamiliar territory. Their main concern is the high cost relative to the value received, which is understandable given their student budget.\n\nWhile tipping is customary, the situation doesn't paint the author as being in the wrong. They're making a reasonable judgment based on their financial circumstances and understanding of the situation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
