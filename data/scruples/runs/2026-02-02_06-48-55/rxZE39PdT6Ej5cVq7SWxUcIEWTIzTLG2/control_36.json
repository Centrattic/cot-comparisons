      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, usually make their own food. When they do order, the delivery fee makes the total high, like $19 for ramen. They mention in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with cash, they give tips with the change. Now they're in the US and using a card, so they're not tipping.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, but it's not always mandatory. Some people do it, others don't. The delivery fee might include a tip, but not always. The user is paying with a card, so maybe they don't see the same expectation as cash. But the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user is being frugal, which is understandable as a student. However, not tipping in a place where it's expected could be seen as rude. But the situation is a bit nuanced. They might not know the US norms, coming from a country where 10% is standard. Also, the high total ($19 for ramen) could make them feel it's reasonable to not tip. But if the delivery fee is separate and doesn't include the tip, then maybe the delivery person relies on tips for their income. \n\nWait, the user says \"I end up paying a lot for not too much food.\" So the total price is high, but does the delivery fee already account for a tip? If not, then the delivery person might not be getting any tip, which could be the case here. In the US, delivery drivers often don't get a livable wage without tips. So even if the user is tight on money, not leaving any tip could be considered wrong, especially if the delivery fee doesn't cover it. \n\nBut the user is paying with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip through the app. Maybe they didn't know they could add a tip that way. Alternatively, they might be under the impression that the delivery fee replaces the tip. The answer would depend on that. If the delivery fee is a separate charge and the tip isn't included, then not tipping might be inconsiderate. However, if the delivery fee is supposed to cover the driver's pay, then maybe not. \n\nSince the user is in the US and the question is about their actions there, the local norms are key. In the US, even with card payments, it's customary to add a tip for delivery. So if they didn't do that, even though they paid a delivery fee, they might be in the wrong. But the user is comparing to their home country where 10% is standard, and maybe here the expectation is higher. However, the example is $19 for ramen. Let's say the ramen itself is $10, the delivery fee is $5, and then a $4 tip would be 10% on the total, but in the US, 15-20% is more common. But the user is saying they pay $19 total, which might include the delivery fee. If the base cost is lower, maybe the tip is still expected. \n\nAlternatively, in some places, delivery fees might be a service charge that goes to the company, not the driver. So the driver's pay depends on tips. If the user is not tipping, the driver might not get any additional money. Given that the user is in a situation where they can still afford to tip a small amount, maybe $2-3, even as a student. So, the author not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily in the wrong. However, since they're aware of the US norms and the expectation, even if they're paying with a card, they should consider adding a tip. \n\nBut the user is confused about the US tipping culture. They might not realize that tips are expected regardless of payment method. If the app allows for adding a tip when paying by card, then not adding it could be considered wrong. The answer depends on whether the delivery fee includes a tip. If not, and the user is in the US, they are in the wrong for not tipping. But if the delivery fee is supposed to cover the driver's pay, then maybe not. However, the user's situation is that the total is high, so they might not have the extra. But as a student, maybe they should still tip a small amount. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is expected for delivery services, regardless of payment method. Even if the fee is high, the tip is separate and supports the delivery person's income. The user's reasoning based on their home country's norms might not apply here, and they should adjust to local customs. So they are in the wrong for not tipping when using a card.\n"
