      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery and tip) too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but when using a card, they don't tip. The main question is if not tipping in this case makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, even if it's not as strictly enforced as in restaurants. Some places include a tip automatically, others let you add it. The author might not be aware of this norm, coming from a country where tipping is 10% when paying cash. They might be confused about how tipping works with card payments, possibly thinking that the tip is already included or that it's optional. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the total cost is high, so they can't afford to tip. But in the US, delivery fees and tips are separate. The delivery fee is part of the total, and the tip is an additional amount. If they're paying with a card, they can still choose to add a tip, even if it's not automatic. However, not tipping could be seen as not acknowledging the service, especially if the delivery person has to wait for the tip or if the establishment relies on tips as part of their income.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a student with limited funds. They might be making a conscious decision to save money, but in the US, not tipping could be considered rude or inconsiderate. However, there's also the argument that tipping should be based on service quality, and if the service was poor, it's acceptable to leave less or none. The author doesn't mention the quality of the service, so it's hard to say. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? In the US, not tipping might be seen as wrong, especially if the total includes delivery fees but not a tip. However, the author might be unfamiliar with local customs. The answer hinges on whether the author knew the expectation and if they were willfully ignoring it. If they didn't know, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they knew and chose not to tip despite being able to, then they might be. The author says they can't afford it, but they might be able to tip a small amount even as a student. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could go either way. But in the US context, tipping is expected even for delivery, so the author might be in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument about financial constraints. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether it's understandable. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
