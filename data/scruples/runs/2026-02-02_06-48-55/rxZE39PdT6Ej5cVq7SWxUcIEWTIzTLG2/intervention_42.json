      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student who orders food occasionally and is concerned about not tipping the delivery guy. They mention that they pay with a card and feel it's absurd to pay $19 for ramen with delivery fees. They're asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user is from a country where tipping is 10%, which is similar to the US, though US tipping is typically 15-20%. However, in the US, tipping for delivery is sometimes expected, even if it's not as much as for in-person service. But the user is a student with limited funds, so their financial situation is a factor.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of tipping in delivery services and the user's ability to pay. In the US, delivery workers often rely on tips as part of their income, even though they might be paid a base rate. However, if the user is paying with a card and doesn't add a tip, it's possible they didn't know that the app or website allows for adding a tip. Some platforms require you to add a tip when paying with a card, while others don't. If the user didn't add a tip, they might not be aware of the local customs or the expectations in the US versus their home country.\n\nBut the user is in the US, as they mention the US in their question. So they should be aware or at least have some responsibility to learn local norms. However, they're a student, which might mean they're adjusting to new environments and might not have the same financial flexibility. The cost of the meal including delivery is $19, which in the US is relatively low, but for a student, any extra expense might be a burden. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the delivery worker is paid a living wage. Some argue that tipping is a way to supplement low wages, but others might say that delivery drivers should be fairly paid by their employers regardless of tips. However, the question is about whether the user is in the wrong for not tipping, not about the broader issue of fair wages.\n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong if they are unable to afford a tip, especially if they don't know the local tipping customs. However, if they were aware that tipping is expected in the US and chose not to, that might be different. But since they mention that in their country it's 10%, they might be trying to apply that norm to the US context. But in the US, delivery tips are often higher, so perhaps they didn't realize the expectation. \n\nAnother angle: when paying with a card, some apps automatically add a tip unless you opt out. If the user didn't add a tip, maybe they didn't know how to do it. If the user is new to the US, they might not be familiar with this process. So in that case, they're not intentionally avoiding a tip but are just unaware.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they might not be intentionally avoiding the tip and are in a difficult financial situation. But if tipping is part of the service expectation in the US, then maybe A. However, given the context of their financial situation and possible lack of knowledge, B is more likely.\n"
