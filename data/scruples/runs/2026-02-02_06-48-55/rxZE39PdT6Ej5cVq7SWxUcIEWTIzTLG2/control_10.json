AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, and they mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, which they give when paying cash. But when using a card, they don't tip because they don't have change. They paid $19 for ramen, which seems high to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery services, usually around 15-20%, and sometimes even more if the service is good. Unlike some countries where service charge is included, in the US, it's often expected that customers add a tip, especially for delivery where the driver's income might rely on it.\n\nThe author is a student with financial constraints. They pay with a card, so they don't have cash to leave a tip. But in the US, even with card payments, it's common to add a tip at checkout. The delivery fee might be separate, but the tip is part of the driver's earnings. The author might not be aware that in the US, tipping is expected regardless of payment method. Since they paid with a card, they could have added the tip through the app or website before submitting the payment. Not doing so might leave the driver without the expected compensation.\n\nHowever, the author is coming from a different cultural background where tipping isn't as automatic. They might not realize the importance of tipping here. But since they're in the US (as implied by the question about US tipping habits), they should be aware of local customs. The high cost they mention includes the delivery fee, but the tip is separate and necessary for the delivery person's income. So even if the total seems high, the tip is a standard part of the process. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the local tipping norm, even if it's different from their home country.\n"
