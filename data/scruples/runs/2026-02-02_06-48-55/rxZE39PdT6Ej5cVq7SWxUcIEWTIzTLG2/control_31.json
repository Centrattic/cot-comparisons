      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is a student with limited money. They don't order food often because they usually make their own. When they do order, they mention that the total cost, including the delivery fee, ends up being high for not much food. They paid with a card and didn't tip. They're asking if they're an a**hole for not tipping. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but when paying with cash, they give a tip when they get change. However, with a card, they didn't add a tip. The total for their ramen was $19.\n\nFirst, I should consider the cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary and expected for service workers, especially in the food delivery industry. The standard tip is often 15-20%, but it can vary. The writer is from a country where 10% is standard, but they're in the US now, so they might need to adjust to the local customs.\n\nThe delivery fee is separate from the tip. The writer is upset about the delivery fee making the total high, but the question is specifically about the tip. The fact that they paid with a card might be relevant because some people forget to add a tip when using cards, especially if the system doesn't prompt them. However, in the US, even when using a card, it's typical to include a tip unless the transaction is contactless and the tip isn't automatically added.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the cost is already high. However, the tip is a separate part of the cost. The delivery fee is charged by the restaurant or delivery service, but the tip is for the delivery person's service. Even if the total is high, the tip is a way to compensate the delivery worker for their service, especially since in many cases, delivery workers rely heavily on tips as part of their income.\n\nThe writer's argument is that they follow the 10% tip in their country but don't in the US. However, in the US, 15-20% is standard for good service. Even if they can't afford the full amount, contributing a smaller tip if possible might be considered. However, the writer is a student with limited funds, so maybe they can't afford any tip. But is it necessary to tip even in that case?\n\nAnother angle: some delivery apps allow you to tip after the delivery, and if the writer didn't include a tip when paying with the card, they might have missed the opportunity. If the transaction was through an app, maybe the tip is optional, but the expectation is still there. Also, the delivery person might not earn a living wage without tips.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is being honest about their financial situation and their habits. They might be in the right if they can't afford a tip, but in the US, not tipping at all is generally seen as rude or inconsiderate. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping despite their financial situation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the expectation in the US is to tip regardless of financial status, or if the person's situation excuses them from tipping. In many cases, people with limited funds still manage to tip a small amount. However, if they can't afford any tip at all, maybe it's considered acceptable. But given that the writer is a student who can order food occasionally, perhaps they can spare a small tip, even if it's less than 10%.\n\nIn summary, the writer might be in the wrong if the US expectation is to tip even when using a card, regardless of the total cost. However, if their situation makes tipping impossible, they might not be in the wrong. But given that they can order food at all, they likely have some disposable income, so not tipping could be seen as wrong.\n"
