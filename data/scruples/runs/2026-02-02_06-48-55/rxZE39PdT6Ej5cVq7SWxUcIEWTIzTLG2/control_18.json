      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, find the total price (including delivery fee) high, and didn't tip when paying by card. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they pay with cash otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, usually around 15-20%. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard. So there's a cultural difference here. They might not be aware of the higher US tipping expectations.\n\nAlso, they're a student with financial constraints. They pay with a card, which might not make tipping as automatic as cash. When paying cash, they tip when getting change, which is different from card payments where tipping isn't mandatory unless added. So maybe they didn't realize they could tip via the card transaction, or they didn't know the expectation.\n\nThe delivery fee is included in the total, but that's separate from the tip. The user feels the total is high, but the question is about tipping. The key is whether not tipping is considered wrong here. Since they're from a different country with different practices and might not be aware of US norms, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're in the US, they should know the local custom. However, the situation doesn't specify the location. The user could be in the US but following their home country's norms. \n\nSo, considering the cultural context and financial situation, the answer might be B. They're not in the wrong because they're following their country's practices and have limited funds. But if they're in the US, they should adapt. But since the question is framed as \"AITA for not tipping,\" assuming the US context, but the user's explanation gives their own country's practice. It's a bit tricky. However, the main point is their lack of knowledge due to different cultural norms. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
