      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's see. The user is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and is paying with a card. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip with the change. However, when using a card, they don't tip because they feel the total is already high. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping in the US.\n\nFirst, I should consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually around 15-20%, but some people might leave less if they can afford it. However, the user is a student with limited funds, which might affect their ability to tip. The total they paid was $19 for ramen, which could be seen as a bit steep, but the delivery fee might be part of that. \n\nThe user mentions they pay with a card, and in their country, they tip with cash. So maybe they don't have a habit of adding tips when using cards, especially if the platform doesn't have an option to add a tip automatically. But in the US, some delivery apps require a tip when paying by card, so the user might not have realized that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a cultural expectation issue. If they're in the US and unaware of the tipping norm, maybe they're not at fault. But if they know the norm and choose not to tip, they might be seen as inconsiderate. However, their financial situation is a factor. The delivery fee might be separate from the tip. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) because the user is in a different country's norm and has financial constraints. Alternatively, if they're in the US and should know the local customs, maybe A (Yes). But the question doesn't specify the location. The user's original country has 10% tipping, which is less than US standards, so maybe they're adjusting to the new norm. \n\nAlso, the total price includes delivery, but in the US, tips are separate. So even if the total seems high, the tip isn't part of the food or delivery fee. If the user didn't leave a tip, the delivery guy doesn't get it, which could be unfair. But the user's situation is tight. \n\nConsidering all that, it's a judgment call. Some might say they should tip if they can, others might understand their financial situation. Since the user is a student and the amount is $19, maybe it's reasonable to not tip if they can't afford it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
