      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) too high for the food they get. They mention that in their country, they tip 10% when paying cash by giving change, but here they pay with a card and don't tip. They spent $19 on ramen noodles and feel it's absurd.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is a common practice, especially for services like delivery. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it can vary. However, the key here is that the author is not tipping at all. The question is whether they're in the wrong by not tipping in this case.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they have limited funds and the cost is already high. But in the US, tips are considered part of the service cost, and not tipping can be seen as disrespectful or unfair to the delivery person, who relies on tips as part of their income. Even if paying with a card, many platforms allow for adding a tip. So the author could choose to tip a smaller amount if they're budget-constrained. \n\nHowever, the author might not be aware of the cultural differences in tipping. In some countries, tipping isn't expected or is handled differently when paying by card. But since the question is from a US context, the expectation would be higher. The author's justification for not tipping because they feel the food is overpriced is another point. But the delivery fee and the cost of the food are separate from the tip. The delivery person's effort is still there, so the tip is for their service, not the food price.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer could depend on perspective. If the author is new to the US, maybe they're unaware. But they do mention knowing the tipping norm in their country, so maybe they should adjust here. However, the argument could be made that if they can't afford to tip, they should avoid ordering or choose a service that doesn't require tipping. But that's a bit harsh. Alternatively, maybe a small tip is expected even if they can't give 15-20%. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because not tipping at all in the US is generally frowned upon, especially if they can afford the order. Even if they're on a tight budget, a minimal tip is usually expected. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
