AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total price (including delivery fee and food) to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they paid with a card and didn't tip, leading the question of whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, especially if the service was good. The author mentions their country's 10% tip, but they're in the US now. So maybe they're not aware of the US tipping norms.\n\nThen, there's the financial aspect. The author is a student with limited funds. Paying $19 for ramen might be a stretch for them. However, tipping is part of the expected cost in the US service industry. Delivery workers rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. Not tipping could be seen as unfair to the worker, even if the author is in a tight spot.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the total cost is already high, with delivery fees and the food price. Maybe the author feels they're being overcharged. However, tips are separate from delivery fees and the base price. So even if the total is high, the tip is an additional amount that the customer is expected to contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be aware that in the US, not tipping is considered rude or unfair. They might be following the tipping habits from their home country, which is a 10% tip, but in the US context, that's lower than the norm. So there's a cultural misunderstanding here.\n\nThe key points are: the author's financial situation, cultural norms regarding tipping, and the expectation in the US. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping despite these factors. \n\nSome people might argue that everyone has to manage their money, and not tipping is a financial decision, not necessarily wrong. Others might say that not tipping is unfair to the delivery worker who depends on it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action is considered wrong in the US context. Since the author is in the US, they should be expected to follow local customs. However, being a student with limited funds could mitigate the blame. But since tipping is part of the service cost here, the author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate towards the worker's livelihood.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because in the US, not tipping is considered neglecting a part of the worker's income, even if the total seems high. The author's financial situation is a mitigating factor but doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to tip according to local norms.\n"
