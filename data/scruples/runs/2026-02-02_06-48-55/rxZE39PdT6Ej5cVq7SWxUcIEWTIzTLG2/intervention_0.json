AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that the author is a student with limited money who orders food occasionally. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when paying cash, they tip when getting change. But when paying by card, they don't tip, especially when the total seems high. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping in the US, where tipping norms might be different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping culture. In the US, especially for delivery, it's customary to tip around 15-20% for services like delivery, even if paying by card. Some apps even have a tip section. So if the author isn't tipping because they're paying by card, that might be a mistake. The delivery fee is usually separate from the tip, so the author's complaint about the total cost might stem from misunderstanding that the tip is part of the payment. Also, not tipping when using a card could be seen as not following local customs, even if in their home country it's different. However, maybe the author isn't aware of US practices. But they do mention knowing about 10% in their country, so maybe they know about tipping norms but are choosing not to because of the price. So the question is whether they're wrong for not tipping. The answer would depend on whether the US expects tipping as part of the service, which it does. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip, even though they have limited funds. The answer is A.\n"
