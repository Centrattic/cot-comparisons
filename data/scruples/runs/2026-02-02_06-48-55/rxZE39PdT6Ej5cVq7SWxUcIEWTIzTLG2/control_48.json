      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high for the amount of food. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they used a card here, they didn't tip. They're wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In the US, tipping delivery drivers is customary, often expected, and part of their income. Even if there's a delivery fee, many people still add a tip. The user might not be aware that in the US, the expectation is different from their home country. However, they are aware of the 10% tip when using cash, which implies they know tipping is part of the process, but maybe they didn't know if it's mandatory when using a card. \n\nThe key points here are: the person is a student with limited funds, they paid with a card, and they didn't tip. The question is whether they're at fault. In the US, not tipping when using a card is common, as some platforms allow adding a tip during the transaction. However, if the user didn't add a tip at all, even if they had the option, then they might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the platform didn't make it easy to tip, maybe the user is not at fault. But the user's argument is that they think the total is too high already, so they don't add extra. \n\nAnother angle: the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The delivery fee goes to the company, while the tip goes to the driver. So even if the delivery fee is high, the tip is still expected. However, the user might not know that. Also, in some apps, the tip is optional, so the user might not realize they need to add it. But the user is aware of tipping when paying cash, so maybe they just didn't apply that to card payments. \n\nIs the user wrong? If they knew the tip was expected and didn't do it, maybe yes. But if they didn't know, then no. The user's main point is that they think the total is too high for the food and delivery, so they don't tip. But the tip is separate. So, the user might be justifying not tipping because they feel overcharged, but the tip is for the service, not the food. \n\nIn conclusion, in the US, not tipping could be considered wrong because the driver relies on tips. However, if the user is unaware that they can tip via card (like through an app), then they might not be at fault. The situation is a bit ambiguous, but since the user is aware of tipping in cash, maybe they should have known to tip with a card as well. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance.\n"
