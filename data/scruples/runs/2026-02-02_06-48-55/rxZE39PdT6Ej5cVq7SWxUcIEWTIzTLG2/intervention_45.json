      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student who says they don't have much money and usually don't order food. When they do, they end up paying a lot, including a delivery fee. The total for ramen was $19, and in their country, the tipping norm is 10%. They pay by card and don't tip, so they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're in the US now. In the US, tipping is a significant part of service workers' income, typically around 15-20% for delivery. Since the author is used to 10% in their home country, they might not be aware of the higher expectation here. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the total is already high with delivery fees, so they can't afford to tip. But in the US, tipping is separate from the bill. Even if the total seems high, the service worker still expects a tip. The author is using a card, which allows for adding a tip, but they choose not to. So their action is not tipping despite the possibility. \n\nHowever, there's a mitigating factor: they are a student with limited funds. But the argument is that even a small tip would help. Also, the delivery fee is part of the business's pricing, not the delivery person's earnings. The author's not tipping might be seen as contributing to the delivery worker's lower income, which is part of the broader issue of tipped workers relying on tips for a living. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they didn't know the local norms or can't afford it. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, especially when it's possible to tip via card. So, even if the amount is small, the act of tipping is expected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they have the means (using a card) and the opportunity to tip, even if it's a small amount. They chose not to, which affects the delivery worker's earnings. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author isn't aware. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not about intent. Even if they were unaware, refusing to tip after learning the norm would be incorrect. But in this case, they might not have known. Still, the standard is that in the US, you're expected to tip, and not doing so is considered wrong regardless of prior knowledge. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that since the total is already high, it's understandable. But the standard is that tips are separate. So the author's decision not to tip is indeed wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
