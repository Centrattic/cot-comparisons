      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays by card. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying cash, they give a tip with the change. Now, using a card, they didn't tip and ended up paying $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In the US, tipping is a cultural norm for services like delivery, where the tip is often part of the worker's income. However, the user is from a country where tipping is 10%, which might be different. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping in the US despite their financial situation.\n\nThe key points: The user is a student with limited funds, paying by card, and not tipping because they don't have cash. They feel the total cost is high. The US typically expects tips for delivery, sometimes 15-20%, but maybe the user isn't aware of that. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, in the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate because delivery workers rely on tips. However, the user is in a different country, so maybe they're not aware of the local norms. But the question is about the US situation. Wait, the user wrote \"in the US but in my country its 10%\", so they're in the US? The original question says \"in the US\" but the user is from another country. So the user is in the US, ordering delivery there. So according to US norms, they should tip. But they didn't because they don't have cash and are used to a different system. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't tip when paying with card. In the US, sometimes tips are added via the card payment, but maybe they didn't do that. So if they have the option to tip via card, they should. If they didn't, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they're not aware of the local tipping culture, that's a different angle. \n\nHowever, the user is responsible for knowing local norms when spending in the US. Since they're a student, maybe they are an international student. The question is whether not tipping is wrong. If the user expects to pay only the total without tip, but in the US, the tip is expected, then they are in the wrong. But if the user is from a country where tipping isn't customary, maybe they are not. \n\nBut the user is in the US now. So the answer would depend on whether the user is expected to follow US tipping norms. So in this case, the delivery guy might rely on tips, so not tipping could be wrong. However, the user's financial situation is a factor. But the question is about being in the wrong. So if they can afford to tip even a small amount, they should. If they can't, maybe not. But the user is a student with limited funds, so maybe they can't. \n\nBut the user is paying by card, so they could add a tip through the payment method. So if they didn't, even though they can, then they are in the wrong. But if they didn't know, maybe not. However, the user should have checked the local norms. So the answer is more likely A (they are in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is expected, and the user had the means to do so via card, so not tipping is inconsiderate.\n"
