      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. They're a student with limited money, usually make their own food, and sometimes order. They mention paying $19 for ramen including delivery and not tipping when paying by card. In their country, 10% is standard, but they don't tip when paying by card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even if not mandatory. Some places have an automatic tip added, but if not, customers are expected to tip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping when using a card.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't have much money and feel the total is already high. But in the US, not tipping could be seen as rude or stingy, especially since delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. However, the author might not know US customs. If they're from a country where tipping is different, maybe they're unaware. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong here. \n\nFactors: They paid with a card and didn't add a tip. If the app or restaurant allows card tipping (like adding a tip before checkout), not adding it could be considered not tipping. If the system doesn't allow it, maybe it's less clear. But generally, in the US, even if you pay by card, you're expected to tip unless it's automatic. \n\nAlso, the total they paid seems high, but that's separate from tipping. The delivery fee is a separate charge, and tips are for the service. So not tipping, regardless of the total cost, might be seen as wrong in US context. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is expected, and not doing so is considered rude or unfair to the worker. However, some might argue that if they can't afford it, it's understandable, but culturally, it's still expected. The key is the cultural expectation versus personal financial situation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the societal expectation in the US would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) yes. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
