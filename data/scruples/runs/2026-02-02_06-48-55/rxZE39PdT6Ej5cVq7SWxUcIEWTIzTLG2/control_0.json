AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery to be high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with a card, they don't tip. They paid $19 for ramen, which seems expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, usually around 15-20%, especially if the service is good. However, the user is from a different country where 10% is standard, so there might be a cultural misunderstanding. \n\nThe user is a student with financial constraints. They order food infrequently and might not be used to the US tipping culture. They might not have realized that not tipping when paying by card is possible, but it's still expected. However, the cost of the meal plus delivery being high could be a factor in their decision not to tip. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in the US context, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since delivery workers often rely on tips. But if the user is unaware of the local customs, that's a mitigating factor. Also, their financial situation might make them prioritize differently. However, the community might expect a tip even in such cases. \n\nSo the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite knowing the US context (since they ordered from a US place) or B (no) because they're following their home country's norms and have financial constraints. I need to weigh these aspects. The key point is whether the user's actions align with US expectations. Since the question is about their responsibility in the US context, even if they're a foreigner, they might still be expected to tip. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
