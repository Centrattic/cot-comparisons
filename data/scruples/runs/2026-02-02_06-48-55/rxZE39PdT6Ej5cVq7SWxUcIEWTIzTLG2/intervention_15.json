AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high for a small meal. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but they pay with a card and don't tip in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20%, right? The user comes from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're not aware of the higher expectation here. However, since they did the transaction in the US (assuming the context is US-based), the local tipping norms would apply.\n\nThe person argues they can't afford to tip because they're a student with limited money and the total cost is high. But even a small percentage (like 10%) would be a tip. The key here is that they didn't leave any tip at all. Even if it's a small amount, tipping is expected in the US for delivery services. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the delivery person's income often relies on tips.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's financial situation is a valid point. Students often have tight budgets. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all, regardless of the amount, is generally frowned upon. The author might not be aware of the cultural difference, but the responsibility is on them to adapt to local norms when using local services.\n\nSo, considering the US tipping culture and the expectation that delivery drivers depend on tips for part of their income, the author didn't tip, which is against the local norm. Therefore, they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
