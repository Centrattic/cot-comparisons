AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and feel the delivery fee is already high. They mention they tip 10% in their country when paying cash but don't tip when using a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often 15-20%. The user is from a country where 10% is standard, but they're in the US now. So maybe they're just applying their own cultural norms, not knowing that US expectations are different. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. If they're in the US, the local practice is important. Not tipping might be seen as neglecting a part of the delivery driver's income, especially since some places add a tip line to the payment when using a card. The user didn't tip, even though they paid by card. \n\nBut they argue they can't afford it. As a student, their financial situation is tight. Maybe they feel the delivery fees are already high, making it hard to add a tip. On the other hand, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their pay. \n\nSo it's a bit of a balance between cultural expectations, personal financial constraints, and the local practice. If the user is aware of the US tipping norms and still chooses not to tip despite being able to afford a small amount, they might be in the wrong. But if they genuinely can't afford it, maybe not. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping when they could, even if it's a small amount. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the user is expected to follow US tipping norms regardless of their personal situation. If they're new to the country, they might not know that tips are part of the service cost here. However, if they've been there long enough to know the customs, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all these points, there's a mix of factors. The user might be in the wrong if they're aware of the norms and can afford to tip, but if they're struggling financially and unaware of the local customs, they might not be. But since they mention paying by card, maybe they didn't know they could add a tip that way. In that case, they might not be in the wrong because they just didn't know.\n"
