      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The scenario is from the US, where tipping is customary, but the person is a student with limited money. The cost breakdown includes a delivery fee and the total came to $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, it's typical to tip around 15-20% for services like food delivery, but there's some variation. The person mentions their home country uses 10%, which is different. However, they're in the US now, so the local custom applies.\n\nThe user is a student with financial constraints. They order food occasionally, which suggests they might not have the means to tip regularly. However, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The total cost is $19, which might be high due to delivery fees, but the tip is still expected as part of the service.\n\nBut the key here is whether the person is in the wrong. If they didn't tip, even if they paid with a card, the expectation in the US is that you should tip, especially for delivery. The delivery driver relies on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could be seen as not fulfilling a social expectation, even if it's not a legal requirement.\n\nHowever, there's also the angle of personal financial circumstances. If the person truly can't afford to tip, some might be more understanding. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on the cultural context of the US versus their home country. But they are in the US, so the local custom is what matters.\n\nSo, in the US, not tipping is generally frowned upon unless there's a valid reason, like poor service. Since the person didn't mention any bad service, just cost concerns, they might be considered in the wrong. But others might argue that if they can't afford it, they're not in the wrong. However, the consensus in the US is that tipping is expected regardless of income, as it's part of the service cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite the US norms, even if they're a student. But some might say B (not in the wrong) if they can't afford it. The community response here might be mixed, but typically, in such scenarios, the expectation is to tip, so A is more likely the answer here.\n"
