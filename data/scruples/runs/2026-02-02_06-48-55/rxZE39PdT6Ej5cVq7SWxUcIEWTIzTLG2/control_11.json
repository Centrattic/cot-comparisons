AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention not tipping when paying by card because in their country, tipping is 10% and they tip when paying cash. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping when using a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user is in the US, where tipping is customary, especially for services like delivery. In many countries, tips are a part of the service worker's income, so not tipping could mean they don't get paid fairly. However, the author's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the total cost is high. \n\nBut in the US, even when paying by card, it's common to leave a tip. Some platforms have a built-in tip section, so it's expected. The author's country's norm (10% cash tip) might not apply here. The delivery fee is separate from the tip, which is part of the service compensation. \n\nAlso, the author might be conflating delivery fees with tips. The delivery fee is charged by the restaurant or service, while the tip is for the delivery person. Even if the total seems high, the tip is a separate expectation. \n\nSo, the author's argument is based on their own financial situation and cultural background, but in the US context, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the delivery person relies on tips. The fact that they pay by card doesn't exempt them from tipping. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not following the local custom, even if they're struggling financially.\n"
