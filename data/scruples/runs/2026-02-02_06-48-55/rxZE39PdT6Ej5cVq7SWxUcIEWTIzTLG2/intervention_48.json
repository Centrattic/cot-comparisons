      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they don't order food often, and when they do, they end up paying a lot including the delivery fee. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying by card, they don't give a tip. They paid $19 for ramen and didn't tip. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The question is set in the US, where tipping is expected for delivery services. Even though the author is from a country where 10% is standard, in the US, delivery tips are also expected. So if they're in the US, they should be aware of that. But the user is in a different country, maybe? The question isn't clear on that. Wait, the original question says \"I don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country it's 10%.\" So the author is in the US but from another country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware of US tipping customs.\n\nIn the US, for delivery, people often tip 10-15%, especially when paying by card. Since they paid by card, they could add a tip there. The author says they usually tip when paying cash, but with a card, they don't. Maybe they don't know how to tip via card. But if they have the means to pay by card, they should know that the tip is part of the process. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate because delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income.\n\nHowever, the author is a student with limited funds. The cost of the food plus delivery is $19, which is a significant amount for them. But the argument is whether they should still tip regardless of financial situation. In the US, tipping is expected even if you're paying by card. So the author might be in the wrong for not tipping in this case. The fact that they didn't tip when they could have, even with their financial constraints, might make them at fault. Alternatively, if they didn't know the customs, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But since they mentioned they know about US tipping norms (they asked about it), they should be aware and adjust accordingly.\n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip despite knowing the US tipping culture when using a card.\n"
