AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they order food occasionally, and the total ends up being $19 for ramen. The delivery fee and the price make it seem like a lot. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they might not tip when paying by card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Tipping is common there, especially for service jobs like delivery. Even if the total seems high, the expectation is that a tip is part of the payment. The user says they don't tip when paying with a card, which might be an issue because some people might automatically add a tip at checkout, but the author didn't. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee might be separate from the tip. The author might not realize that the delivery fee is just for the service, and the tip is for the delivery person's work. Even if the total feels high, the service aspect should include a tip. But since they're a student with limited funds, is it reasonable to expect them to tip? However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not whether it's easy for them. \n\nIn the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate because the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income. So, even if the author is tight on money, not tipping might be considered wrong. But some might argue that in other countries, tipping isn't expected, so the author might not know. However, the scenario is set in the US, so the expectation is there. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip despite the cultural expectation, even if they think it's unfair. The reasoning would be that tipping is part of the social norm, and not doing so is disrespectful to the delivery person's work. Even if they paid by card, they could have added a tip manually. So, A for yes.\n"
