AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery and tip too high. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying by card, they don't leave a tip. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often expected to be around 15-20%. However, the person is from a country where it's 10%, so maybe they're not used to the US norms. But the question is about the US situation here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong in the US context.\n\nThe person is a student with financial constraints. They pay by card, which doesn't allow for cash tips. But in the US, even when paying by card, you can add a digital tip. So maybe they didn't know they could do that. Alternatively, they might have thought that if they pay with a card, the tip is optional. But in many places, especially delivery services, the tip is part of the order, and you can adjust it before payment.\n\nThe total cost is $19 for ramen. If the tip is, say, $2, that's a significant portion for the person. But delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings. However, the person's financial situation is a factor. But in the US, even if you're on a tight budget, it's generally expected to tip for services unless the service was poor.\n\nSo, the dilemma here is between the person's financial situation and the expectation of tipping. The answer might depend on whether the person was aware that tipping is expected in the US for delivery services. If they didn't know, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But if they knew and chose not to tip, then they might be in the wrong. Since the question is in the context of the US, the default expectation is that tipping is necessary, so the person might be in the wrong unless there's a valid reason. However, if they didn't know the custom, like being from another country, that's a mitigating factor. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer could be either way. But in the US, even if you're a student, not tipping is generally frowned upon unless there's a reason. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong). Alternatively, if their knowledge is limited, maybe B (not in the wrong). I need to decide based on the information given. The person mentions they pay with cash when they give tips, but when using card, they don't. The key is whether they could have added a tip when using the card. If they didn't know, maybe they aren't at fault. But the question is in the US context, so the answer might be A. But considering their financial situation, maybe B. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the general expectation is that you tip, so not doing so makes you at fault. So answer A.\n"
