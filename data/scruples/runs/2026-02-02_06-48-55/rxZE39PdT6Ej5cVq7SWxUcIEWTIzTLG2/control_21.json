      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total cost (including delivery) high. They paid by card and didn't tip, wondering if that's a problem. In their country, 10% is standard, but when paying cash, they tip. But since they used a card, they didn't add a tip.\n\nHmm. The question is whether they're at fault. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even if it's not mandatory. So not tipping in this context could be seen as not following the local norm. But the person's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the cost already includes delivery fees. They might not realize that tips are expected as part of the service. \n\nWait, the user mentions that they usually don't order food much and when they do, it's expensive. Maybe they don't have a habit of tipping because they don't order often. Also, paying by card might make it easier to forget to tip since it's not cash. However, in the US, even with card payments, people usually add a tip through the app or at checkout. So if the delivery app allows for adding a tip when paying by card, not doing so could be seen as not tipping. \n\nSo the person might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the local tipping custom, especially if the delivery service expects it. But the user is from a country where tipping isn't as automatic, so maybe there's a cultural difference. However, if they're in the US, they should adjust to local practices. The cost being high is a personal issue, but not tipping is a social expectation. So the answer might be A, yes, they are in the wrong. But maybe not everyone expects tipping for delivery. Wait, I should check if tipping delivery is expected in the US. Typically, yes, it's a service, so 10-15% is common. So if they didn't tip, even with a card, they didn't follow the custom. Hence, they are in the wrong.\n"
