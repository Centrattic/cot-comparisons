AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) as high as $19 for ramen. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but they pay with a card and only tip when paying cash. The question is whether they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. The user is from a country where tipping is 10%, but they're in the US, where tipping is typically more, like 15-20% for services. If they didn't tip because they paid by card, maybe they don't know that in the US, even with card payments, a tip is expected. Or maybe they think the delivery fee covers the delivery person's pay. But in the US, delivery fees are usually separate from the tip. So the delivery person's income relies heavily on tips, especially for delivery jobs which can be low-paid otherwise.\n\nThe author is a student with limited funds, so they might be struggling to afford the tip. But in the US, the expectation is that you tip for good service. However, if the service is bad, people might not tip. But the author didn't mention the service being bad. They just didn't tip because they paid by card and maybe didn't know the norm. But they do know the tipping rate in their home country, so maybe they're adjusting their behavior based on their own culture instead of the local one.\n\nAnother angle: if they paid by card, maybe they can still add a tip through the app or website when paying. So the method of payment doesn't excise obligation. The cost being $19 is high, but that's including delivery fees. The author might feel they're already paying a lot, but in the US, the tip is part of the service cost. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow local tipping norms, even if it's different from their home country. Alternatively, if they're not aware of the local norms, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they mentioned they pay tips when cash, but not with card, maybe they're just not aware that card payments also require tipping here. However, the user is asking if the author is wrong. The answer hinges on whether not tipping is socially unacceptable in the US context. If the author didn't tip despite knowing the local expectation (since they mentioned the US in the question), then they are in the wrong. If they're genuinely unaware and it's their first time, maybe not. But given that they're asking the question, it's likely they're aware but choose not to. So the answer is A.\n"
