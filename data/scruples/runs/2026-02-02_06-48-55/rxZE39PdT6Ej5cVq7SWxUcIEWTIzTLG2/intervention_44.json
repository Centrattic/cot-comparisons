AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is a student with limited money, right? They don't order food often and usually make their own. When they do order, they mention a high total because of delivery fees, ending up paying $19 for ramen. They\u2019re asking if they're at fault for not tipping when paying by card, since in their home country they tip 10% when paying cash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, a 15-20% tip is common for services like delivery. However, the user isn't familiar with that, coming from a country where 10% is standard. They might not realize the expectation here. Also, paying by card might make it harder for them to leave a tip automatically, unlike cash where they can give change as a tip. \n\nBut the key points here are the user's financial situation and their lack of awareness about US tipping customs. While it's true that not tipping could be seen as wrong, their circumstances\u2014being a student with limited funds and not being used to the local tipping culture\u2014might mitigate the blame. They might not have the means to tip as much as expected here. \n\nHowever, the user could argue that they should have done some research or adjusted their payment method. But given that they only occasionally order food and are already paying a high total, expecting them to add a tip on top might be unreasonable. Also, some places allow tips to be added at checkout when paying by card, so maybe the user didn't know that option existed. \n\nOn the other hand, in the US, tips are a significant part of delivery drivers' income. Not tipping could affect their earnings. But again, the user is in a position where money is tight. There's a balance between respecting customs and understanding personal constraints. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to adapt to a new system while managing their finances. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, the user's explanation of their situation and the cultural difference might justify their actions.\n"
