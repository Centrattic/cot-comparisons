      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, and they feel the total cost is too high for the food they get. In their country, tipping is 10%, but they usually pay with a card and don't give a tip. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which they find expensive.\n\nFirst, in the US, tipping is part of the service industry, especially for delivery drivers. While it's not legally required, it's culturally expected. If you pay with a card, you're supposed to add a tip right then. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the driver's income, which is partly dependent on tips.\n\nBut the person's reasoning is that they can't afford it. They're a student, so money is tight. They might not have the means to tip even if they wanted to. Also, the total cost seems high to them. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, not tipping is against the norm in the US, especially if they're aware of the tipping culture. On the other, if they genuinely can't afford it, maybe they're not at fault. But the fact that they paid with a card and didn't use cash might mean they had the option to add a tip electronically. If they didn't do that, they're not leaving a tip, which could be considered inconsiderate. However, if they didn't have the means to tip at all, maybe that's a different story. The key is whether they had the ability to tip but chose not to. If they could have added a tip via card but didn't, that might make them responsible. If they couldn't afford any tip, maybe they're not. The answer depends on whether they had the means to tip. The user says they \"barely order food\" and \"don't have a lot of money,\" but if they can afford the meal, they can probably afford a small tip. So they might be in the wrong because they chose not to tip despite the cultural expectation.\n"
