      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The scenario is about a student in the US who's used to tipping 10% in their home country but finds the delivery fees in the US too high, leading them to not tip when paying by card.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. I know that in the US, it's customary to tip service workers, including delivery drivers, typically around 15-20%. However, some places might have a built-in tip or auto-tip when using a card, but the user here mentions paying with a card and not tipping. They also mention the total cost being $19 for ramen, which seems high because of delivery fees and possible lack of tipping.\n\nThe user is a student with limited money, so financial constraints are a factor. They might not be aware that in the US, tips are expected even when paying by card. In some countries, tipping is either not expected or handled differently, so cultural differences could play a role here. The key points are: 1) US tipping customs vs. their home country, 2) using a card and not tipping, 3) the total cost seems high, including delivery fees.\n\nIf the user didn't tip because they didn't know the US norm, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they were aware and chose not to tip despite knowing it's customary, that could be seen as wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since they mention they usually tip when paying cash, but in this case used a card and didn't tip, maybe they didn't realize that tipping via card is also expected. Alternatively, they might have thought the delivery fee covers it, but that's not the case.\n\nIn the US, the delivery fee is usually separate from the tip. So if they didn't add a tip even when using a card, the driver might rely on that tip as part of their income. So the author not tipping could be seen as not following local customs, hence in the wrong. However, considering their financial situation and possible cultural misunderstanding, maybe it's not their fault. But the standard answer here might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) usually pointing out that if you know the norm and choose not to tip, that's considered wrong. If they were unaware, maybe not. The user says they don't tip when paying by card, but in the US, you can add a tip when paying by card. So if they didn't do that, they might be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (wrong) because they should have tipped, regardless of payment method. But maybe there's a nuance if they didn't know. However, in the US, it's common knowledge that tips are expected even with card payments. So the answer is A.\n"
