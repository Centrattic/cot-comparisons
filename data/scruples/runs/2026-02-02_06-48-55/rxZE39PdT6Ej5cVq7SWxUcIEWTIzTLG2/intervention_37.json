AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a student with limited funds who occasionally orders food. They mention paying a delivery fee and feeling like they're paying a lot for not much, ending up with $19 for ramen. They question whether they're in the wrong for not tipping when paying by card, since in their home country, tipping is 10%. \n\nFirst, in the US, tipping is customary for service, especially for delivery. The usual practice is around 15-20%, which is different from their home country's 10%. The person is paying with a card, which might make it easier to forget to add a tip, especially if they're used to tipping in cash when receiving change. \n\nThey argue their financial situation, being a student with limited money. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Tipping in the US is considered part of the service cost, not optional in the same way as cash tips might be in some countries. Even though they might not have much money, the expectation here is different. \n\nHowever, the total amount seems high. If the delivery fee is included, maybe the base cost is lower, but the delivery and tip would be additional. But the person is focusing on the total cost, possibly not accounting for the tip as separate. \n\nSo, considering the cultural expectation in the US, the person might be expected to tip, even if it's a small amount. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they acknowledge the difference in tipping norms. The delivery person's income often relies on tips. \n\nOn the other hand, the person is being honest about their financial situation. But the question is about right or wrong. In the US context, not tipping would be seen as wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
