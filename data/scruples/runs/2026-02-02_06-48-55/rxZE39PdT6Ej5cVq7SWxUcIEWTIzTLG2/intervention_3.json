AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds it expensive. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with a card, they didn't leave a tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even though it's not mandatory. The standard tip for delivery is often around 15-20%, especially if the delivery is timely. The author didn't tip when paying with a card, which might be common in their home country, but the question is about US norms here.\n\nThe author is a student and mentions financial constraints. But tipping is expected as part of the service cost in the US. Even if the total seems high (like $19 for ramen), the delivery fee and tip are separate from the food price. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the delivery person's income, which is often low. \n\nHowever, the author might not be aware of US tipping etiquette. But since they're ordering from a US-based service, they should adapt to local practices. Not tipping could be considered inconsiderate, even if they're not used to it. On the other hand, if they were unaware, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the community might still side with AITA (Am I the Asshole) here because not tipping is generally frowned upon in the US.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite knowing the US context, even if they're a student with money issues. The expectation here is that in the US, you tip for delivery services, and not doing so is considered rude or inconsiderate, especially when paying by card where it's easier to leave a tip.\n"
