      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total cost (including delivery fee) a bit high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they tip when getting change. However, when using a card, they don't tip and are wondering if that's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their own country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, especially if the service is good. The person seems to be comparing their own country's 10% to US expectations, but maybe they're not aware that in the US, delivery tips are often calculated differently. Some people might add a tip via the app or at checkout when paying with a card, so not tipping in that case could be seen as not following local norms.\n\nHowever, the person's financial situation is a factor. They're a student with limited funds, paying $19 for ramen, which they find expensive. So if they can't afford to tip, is it their fault? The question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, not tipping could be considered rude in the US context. On the other, they're being honest about their financial constraints.\n\nThere's also the part about paying with a card. If the delivery person expects a tip when using a card, maybe the system allows for adding a tip at checkout. If the user didn't do that, then they might be in the wrong. But if the system doesn't automatically add a tip and the user didn't know, that's different. The post doesn't specify whether the app allows for card-based tipping, which is important.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the user had the opportunity to tip when paying with a card. If they could have added a tip through the app but chose not to, then they might be in the wrong. If the system only allows cash tipping, then maybe not. The user's justification is that they can't afford it, but in the US, even a small tip is appreciated. So there's a balance between following local customs and personal financial circumstances.\n\nI think the key here is that in the US, delivery tips are expected, and not tipping (especially when you can afford it) might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user is being honest about their financial situation. So the answer might be nuanced, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're a student, it's possible they're not aware of US tipping norms. But if they knew and chose not to tip despite being able to, then they are in the wrong. If they genuinely can't afford it, maybe not. The post says they \"barely order food\" and \"don't have a lot of money,\" so maybe they are just being honest about their inability to tip, which might not make them in the wrong. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong. So the answer could be B (No), considering their financial situation, but some might argue A (Yes) because tipping is expected. It's a bit of a judgment call.\n"
