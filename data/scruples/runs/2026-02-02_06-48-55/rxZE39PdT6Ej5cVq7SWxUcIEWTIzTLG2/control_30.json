      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, usually makes their own food, and only orders occasionally. They paid with a card and didn't tip. The total came to $19 for ramen, which they feel is expensive. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying cash, they tip when getting change. Since they used a card, they didn't leave a tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, though the amount might be less than for in-person service. Typically, people might tip 10-15%, or even more if the service is good. However, some people might not tip if they feel the service was poor or the price was too high. The author is a student with limited funds, so they might be justifying not tipping because of financial constraints.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. Tipping in the US is often expected, even if it's not mandatory. Delivery workers rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be seen as not contributing to their earnings. However, the author's reasoning is that they find the total price (including delivery fee) too high, so they can't afford to tip. That might be a common sentiment, especially among students.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did pay with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip. If they had paid cash, they might have tipped when getting change. So maybe the payment method influenced their decision. The key here is whether the expectation of tipping applies regardless of payment method. In the US, even with card payments, people usually add a tip in the payment app, so using a card shouldn't be an excuse.\n\nHowever, the author's financial situation is a factor. Students often have tight budgets, and paying $19 for a meal might be a stretch. The question is whether not tipping is justifiable given their circumstances. While the delivery worker should be tipped, the author might feel they can't afford it. But in the US, there's an expectation that you tip for services, even if you're on a budget. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they could have left a small tip even if they couldn't afford more.\n\nBut wait, the author is comparing to their home country where 10% is standard, but in the US, maybe the expectation is higher. However, the author might not be aware of the US norms. The title is \"AITA for not tipping,\" so the user is asking if they're the a**hole for not tipping. The community usually considers intentions and circumstances. If the author is a student on a budget but still chooses not to tip, maybe they are in the wrong because they can find a way to tip a small amount. On the other hand, if the total is already high, maybe they're justified.\n\nI think the consensus in the US would be that you should tip, even if it's a small amount. So the author is in the wrong (A). But considering their financial situation, maybe not. Hmm, this is tricky. The answer might depend on whether the situation is seen as a genuine hardship or just a personal choice. Since the author is a student and the total is high, maybe they're not in the wrong (B). I need to decide based on typical AITA responses. Usually, if someone is on a budget but still chooses not to tip, the community might side with them if they explain their financial situation. However, if they could have tipped even a small amount, they might be in the wrong. But the author didn't tip at all. So I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their reasoning is based on financial constraints and the high total cost, which is a common issue. The delivery fee and high price might make the tip seem excessive. So the answer is B.\n"
