      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy when they paid with a card. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They usually cook but sometimes order food. The total came to $19 for ramen with delivery fees. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they're in the US now. When paying cash, they tip on the change, but with a card, they didn't tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nIn the US, tipping is a common practice and often expected for service workers, including delivery drivers. Tips are a significant part of their income. Even though the amount might seem small, not tipping when using a card could be seen as not contributing to the driver's earnings. However, the author's financial situation is tight, which might mitigate the expectation. But the key point is that in the US, tipping is part of the service cost, and not doing so could be considered rude or unfair. So, the answer might lean towards AITA, but there's a nuance here between cultural expectations and personal circumstances. The author's reasoning is understandable, but the norm in the US is to tip, regardless of payment method. So, maybe the author is in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
