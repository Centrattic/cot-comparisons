      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost, including delivery fees, to be high. They mention that in their country, they tip 10%, but they're in the US now. The total for their ramen was $19, and they didn't tip when paying by card.\n\nIn the US, tipping delivery drivers is common, even if you pay by card. The standard tip is usually around 15-20%, but some people tip less based on the service or the situation. However, not tipping at all could be seen as withholding a customary gratuity. But the person is in a financial bind as a student, so their reasoning is understandable. They might not have the means to tip despite the cultural expectation.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer hinges on cultural norms versus personal circumstances. If the US expects tipping, even when paying by card, then not tipping could be seen as not following the norm. However, if the person is genuinely struggling financially, others might argue it's not their fault. But from the perspective of the delivery driver, they rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could affect their earnings.\n\nOn Reddit, AITA threads often consider both the cultural context and the intent. The author's intent here is about financial constraint, not being rude or malicious. However, the driver isn't aware of the author's situation. So, the answer might depend on whether the community values adhering to cultural tipping norms or empathizes with the student's situation more.\n\nIn similar cases, sometimes people are given the 'not the asshole' label if their reasoning is sincere and they're not intentionally being stingy. For example, if someone can't afford to tip due to financial hardship, others might be more understanding. However, if they're just being cheap without a valid reason, they might be called out.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is a student with limited funds, paying by card, and the total cost seems high to them. They might not realize that in the US, tips are expected regardless of payment method. So, they could be uninformed about the norm. If they had tipped but felt it was a lot, that's different. But since they didn't tip at all, some might say they're in the wrong for not contributing to the driver's income, especially since the driver can't see their financial situation. Others might argue that the system is flawed for adding high delivery fees, making it hard for students to afford tips.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be split. But since the question asks to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Based on US tipping culture, not tipping when you have the means is considered wrong. However, the author is saying they can't afford it. If they truly can't afford it, maybe not the asshole. But if they're just choosing not to tip despite being able to, then yes.\n\nThe author mentions they usually make their own food and only order occasionally, which might mean they can't spare the extra for tips. But even a small tip is expected. So maybe they are in the wrong because they had the money to pay the full amount, including the delivery fee, so they could have allocated a few dollars as a tip. Alternatively, if the total was $19 and they paid by card, maybe they didn't have change to give a tip, but they could still add a tip in the app. The question says they paid with their card, so they might have had the option to add a tip during checkout but chose not to. If they didn't add it at checkout, then they're not tipping. So, the answer would depend on whether they considered the tip as part of their budget. If they can't afford it, B. If they chose not to tip despite being able to, A.\n\nThe original post says they paid with card and didn't tip. The problem is, in the US, when you pay by card, you can choose to add a tip. If they didn't add it, maybe they didn't consider it, but the system allows for it. So perhaps they're in the wrong because they had the means but just didn't choose to tip, even though they claim it's expensive. However, if they truly couldn't afford it, they're not at fault. The answer might be B if the financial constraint is genuine. But since they ordered food, they had the money to spend, so maybe A. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. In AITA threads, sometimes people are called out for not tipping even if they can afford it because it's part of the service. But if they're in a tight spot, others are more lenient. Given that they mention they barely order and it's expensive, maybe B is more appropriate. I think the answer is B.\n"
