      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the text is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost high including delivery fees. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying by card, they don't leave a tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, even when paying by card. However, some places allow adding a tip to the card payment, so maybe the user isn't aware of that. The user might be confused because in their home country, cash tips are standard, but when using a card, they didn't leave one. \n\nThe user's argument is that the total cost is high, so they can't afford to tip. But in the US, the expectation is that the tip is part of the service cost. Even if the total is high, the service (delivery) is separate from the food price. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the delivery person's income, which is expected in the US system. However, the user is in a financial bind as a student, so maybe there's some sympathy there.\n\nBut the core issue is whether they're in the wrong. If the user didn't tip because they didn't know the US tipping norms, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But if they knew and chose not to, then they might be. The text doesn't say they knew about US norms, just that in their country it's 10% with cash. So perhaps they're unaware that in the US, even with card payments, a tip is expected. So, maybe they're not at fault because of cultural misunderstanding. However, some might argue that as a customer, you should be aware of local customs when spending money there.\n\nAlternatively, if they paid with a card and the system allowed adding a tip, but they didn't, that's their choice. But if the system didn't have a tip option, maybe they couldn't. The user doesn't specify. The key is whether the user's action is wrong by local standards. Since in the US, not tipping could be seen as wrong, regardless of the payment method. But the user is a student with limited funds, so maybe there's an argument there. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy. If the expectation is there, then not tipping would make them at fault. But if they were unaware, perhaps not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user knew the US tipping culture. Since they mention their country's norm but don't state knowledge of US norms, maybe they didn't know. However, when using a card, in many places, the tip is added at the point of payment. If the user didn't do that, maybe they were in the wrong. But if the system didn't allow it, then not. The text doesn't specify. Given the information, the user's reasoning is that they didn't tip because they paid by card and in their country, it's done with cash. So, maybe they didn't know to add a tip via card. In that case, they might not be at fault. But others might say that as a customer, you should adjust to local customs. So the answer is a bit tricky. \n\nConsidering all, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the user was unaware of US norms, but A if they should have known. Since the user is a student, maybe they're not familiar. Also, the high cost is a factor. But the question is about being in the wrong. In the US, not tipping is generally frowned upon, so maybe A. But if they didn't know, maybe B. The answer might depend on the platform's tipping policies. If the user could have left a tip via card and didn't, then A. If not, then B. The text doesn't specify, so it's ambiguous. However, in the US, even with card payments, tips are expected. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
