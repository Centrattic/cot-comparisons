      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery and no tip) high. They mention that in their home country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying by card, they don't tip. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping for delivery is a bit different from in-person service. I know that in some places, delivery drivers are tipped for good service, but it's not always mandatory. However, the user is comparing to their home country's 10% tip, which might not directly apply here. \n\nThe user is a student with financial constraints. They pay with a card and don't give a tip, which in some cases might be because they don't have cash for the tip. But cards often allow adding a tip, right? Maybe the platform they use doesn't have an automatic tip option, or they don't know they can add one. \n\nAlso, the cost of the meal plus delivery is $19, which might be considered expensive for a student. However, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings, especially if the driver expects it. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. In the US, some delivery services include a tip option, and sometimes even require a minimum tip. If the user didn't tip because they didn't have cash, but used a card, maybe they didn't know they could add a tip through the card payment. Alternatively, if they intentionally didn't tip, that's different. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely couldn't afford the tip or didn't realize it was expected. However, if they ignored the expectation despite being able to, that's a different story. The answer might depend on the user's intent and local norms. \n\nIn the US, while tipping is customary, it's not always mandatory. Some places allow for service charges, but delivery tips are often separate. If the user is in the US and follows the local norm, maybe they should tip. But if they're from another country and still in the US, they might be under the impression that 10% applies here too. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) if the local expectation is to tip delivery, and they didn't. But if the local norm isn't clear or they were unaware, then B (not in the wrong). I need to check if there's a standard practice in the US regarding delivery tips. Typically, in the US, delivery tips are expected, often 10-15%, similar to other services. So if the author didn't tip despite being able to (since they paid by card), they might be in the wrong. However, if the card payment didn't have an option to add a tip, or the system didn't allow it, then maybe not. The post says they paid with a card but didn't mention if they could add a tip through the card. If the card payment required a tip, and they skipped it, that's different. But if they paid with card and the tip wasn't an option, maybe they couldn't. The original post says they paid with a card and didn't give a tip. If the card allowed for a tip, then the author might be in the wrong. If not, then maybe not. The problem is the ambiguity in the scenario. The answer would depend on whether the card payment system allowed for tipping. Since the user didn't mention that, maybe the default is that they had the ability to tip and chose not to. Therefore, AITA would say they're in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
