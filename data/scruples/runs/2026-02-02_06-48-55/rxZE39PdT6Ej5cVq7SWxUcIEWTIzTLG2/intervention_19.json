AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. They usually cook but sometimes order food. The delivery fee makes the total high, like $19 for ramen. They mention in their country it's 10%, but in the US, they're not tipping when paying by card. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, in the US, tipping is customary for services, especially delivery. It's not a legal requirement, but culturally expected. Even with card payments, people often add a tip in the app or at checkout. The author might not realize that the delivery fee is separate from the tip. Delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income since their base pay is low. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about cost, but they might be contributing to lower pay for the driver. They compare to their home country's 10%, but the US context is different. Even if they're paying by card, the expectation is still there. So, the author is in the wrong because they're not following the local tipping norms, which can affect the delivery worker's earnings. However, some might argue that if the delivery fee is high enough, maybe it's included, but that's not the case here. The fee is likely just for delivery, not tips. So, the answer is A.\n"
