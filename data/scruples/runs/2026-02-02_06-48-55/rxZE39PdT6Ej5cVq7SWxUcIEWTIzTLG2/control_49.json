      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high for a small amount of food. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with cash, they give a tip with change. They paid by card and didn't tip, wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, though it's not mandatory. The author is from a country where 10% is standard, but they're in the US now. The question is whether not tipping (especially with card) is wrong here.\n\nThe author argues that the total cost is high, so tipping might be a stretch for them. However, in the US, even if paying by card, people usually add a tip. Some apps even let you set a tip percentage before payment. Not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's a financial strain. But the author is in a tight situation as a student.\n\nOn one hand, the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income. Not tipping might affect their earnings. On the other hand, the author is trying to manage expenses and might not have the means. But in the US, the expectation is that you tip even if paying by card. So the author is not following the local norm, which could be considered wrong. However, if they can't afford it, maybe there's some leniency. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the norm is to tip, then not doing so could be seen as wrong, even if it's a personal financial choice. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they're ignoring the local tipping culture. But maybe B (No) if the financial hardship is a valid reason. But in the US, people might still expect tipping regardless. So likely A.\n"
