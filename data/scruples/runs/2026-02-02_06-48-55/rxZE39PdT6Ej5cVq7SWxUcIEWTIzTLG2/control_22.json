      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they use a card, they don't tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20% if paying cash. However, when paying by card, some places include a tip section, but it's optional. The author might not know that in the US, even with card payments, tips are expected. The delivery fee is separate from the tip, so the total being high doesn't necessarily mean the tip is unnecessary. The author's reasoning is based on their country's practice where cash tips are given, but in the US, even with card payments, tipping is part of the process. So, maybe the author is not wrong because they're following their own country's habits, but in the US context, they might be expected to tip regardless. However, since they're a student with limited funds, not tipping could be seen as understandable, especially if the delivery fee is already high. The key point is the expectation in the US versus their own country. The answer might depend on whether the tip is considered mandatory in the US for delivery services, even when paying by card. Some argue that delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be seen as wrong. Others might say that if the total is already high, it's acceptable. But the general expectation is that tipping is part of the service. So the author might be in the wrong because they're not following local customs. Alternatively, if the tip is optional and they're using a card, maybe they're not obligated. However, the delivery driver's income could depend on tips. I think the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because in the US, not tipping at all could be considered ungenerous, especially since the delivery fee is separate. The author's justification is based on their country's practices, but adapting to local norms is usually expected when in another country.\n"
