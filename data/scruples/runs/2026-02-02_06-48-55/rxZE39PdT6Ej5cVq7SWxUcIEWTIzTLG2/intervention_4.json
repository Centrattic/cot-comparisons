      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, usually cook their own food, but sometimes order takeout. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which includes a delivery fee. They're from a country where tipping is 10%, and they tip when paying with cash but not with a card. Now they're wondering if they're at fault for not tipping when using a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their home country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%. However, the user is from a place where it's 10%, and they tip when using cash. The confusion here is whether tipping via card is expected. Sometimes, delivery apps or services have a built-in tip section when paying with a card, so not adding that might be seen as not tipping. But if they didn't know that, maybe they're not at fault. Also, the cost seems high ($19 for ramen), which might contribute to their reluctance to tip. But in the US, even if the total is high, the tip is still expected as part of the service. The key points are expectation of tipping in the US, method of payment, and financial constraints. The user's reasoning is that they didn't tip because they paid with a card, but if the app allows tipping via card, then they should have done it. If they didn't know, maybe they're not entirely wrong, but if it's common knowledge in the US, then they are at fault. I think the answer depends on whether the user had the opportunity to tip via card and chose not to. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the consensus might lean towards yes, as tipping is expected, but the user's financial situation adds context. However, in the US, the expectation is higher, so they might be in the wrong (A). But if the app didn't allow tipping via card, then maybe not. The question states they paid with a card, implying they used a system that might include tipping. So the answer is A.\n"
