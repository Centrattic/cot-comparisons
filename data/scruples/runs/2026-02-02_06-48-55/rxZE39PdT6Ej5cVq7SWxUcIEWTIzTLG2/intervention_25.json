AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they pay by card, they don't tip. The question is whether this is acceptable in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. Unlike some countries where service charges are included, in the US, tipping is customary and expected for delivery services. Even when paying by card, it's common to add a tip. The delivery fee is separate from the tip; the fee covers the delivery cost, while the tip is for the service. So not tipping when paying by card would be considered rude or inconsiderate here. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't have much money, but the US tipping culture doesn't typically make exceptions based on financial status. People on a budget still tip, even if it's a small amount. The fact that they pay by card might make it easier to forget to tip, but that's on them. \n\nThe delivery guy's work includes navigating traffic, carrying the food, and ensuring it's delivered on time. Not tipping can impact their income since delivery workers often rely on tips as a significant part of their pay. The author's justification that they tip when paying cash but not when using a card seems inconsistent with US norms. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're not following the expected tipping practices in the US. The fact that they're a student and tight on money doesn't absolve them from the cultural expectation here. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
