      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee and tip) to be too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, and when paying cash, they tip with the change. But when using a card, they don't tip because they're concerned about the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their home country. In the US, tipping for delivery can vary. Some people tip based on the total order, maybe 10-15%, but delivery drivers might not always expect as much as in-person service. However, the question is whether not tipping at all is wrong. The author is a student with financial constraints, which might be a valid reason for not tipping, but it's not the main point. The key issue is whether there's an expectation to tip regardless of payment method. \n\nWhen paying with a card, many people still tip through the app or add a tip at checkout. The author's reasoning is that they don't tip when using a card because they're paying with a card and not handling cash. But in the US, it's common to include a tip when paying by card for delivery services. So by not tipping, they might be going against the local expectation, even if it's not the case in their home country.\n\nHowever, the author's financial situation is a factor. If they can't afford to tip, maybe it's understandable. But the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which implies moral or social responsibility. In the US, while tipping is customary, it's not legally required. So the ethical angle here is about social norms versus personal circumstances. \n\nSome might argue that the author is wrong because not tipping could affect the delivery driver's income, especially if they rely on tips. Others might say that the author's financial constraints justify not tipping. However, the author could consider rounding up the total or adding a small tip even on a card payment. The fact that they pay 19$ for ramen might be seen as expensive, but that's due to delivery fees and the order cost. \n\nIn conclusion, in the US context, there's an expectation to tip for delivery services, even when using a card. The author's decision to not tip, especially if they can afford to tip a small amount, might be seen as inconsiderate. But given their student status and financial situation, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the norm in the US is to tip, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
