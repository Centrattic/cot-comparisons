      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, and they ordered food which cost $19, including delivery fees. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but they paid by card and didn't tip. The question is whether they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even though in their country it's 10%, the US might have different norms. But the user is in the US, as they're asking about US tipping practices. So in the US, the standard tip for delivery is usually around 15-20%, right? Or maybe even higher if the order is small because the delivery fee might be included. However, the user is a student with a tight budget and pays by card. When paying by card, it's easier to forget to tip because you don't get change back. They might not realize that in the US, even with a card, you're expected to add a tip. \n\nNow, the user is paying $19 for ramen, which includes delivery. Let's break it down. If the food itself is, say, $10, delivery is $5, and the rest is tax, then a 10% tip would be $1.40, making the total around $20.40. But the user ended up paying $19, so maybe the tip was not added. However, the user might not see the delivery fee as part of the tip calculation. But in the US, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The tip is a gratuity for the delivery person, not part of the delivery fee. So even if the delivery fee is high, the tip is still expected. \n\nBut the user is in a difficult financial position. They can't afford to tip, especially since they don't order out often. The question is whether the expectation of tipping should override their financial constraints. On one hand, the delivery person's income often relies on tips. Not tipping could be seen as unfair. On the other hand, if the person can't afford to tip, maybe they shouldn't order in the first place. However, the user is a student and might not have a lot of money, so it's a tough spot. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could tip a smaller percentage, like 5% or even 10%, even if it's less than the US standard. They could also consider leaving a tip through the app if they paid by card. But the user didn't do that. The key point is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping at all. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that if the service is poor, not tipping is justified. But the user didn't mention any issues with the delivery. So the fault lies in not tipping at all, even if it's a small amount. However, given their financial situation, some might be more understanding. \n\nI think the answer depends on how strict one is about tipping norms. If the norm is to tip regardless of financial status, then the user is in the wrong. If the norm allows for exceptions when someone can't afford it, then maybe not. But generally, in the US, not tipping at all, even when paying by card, is considered rude. So the author might be in the wrong. But the financial hardship could be a mitigating factor. However, since the user is asking if they are at fault, the answer might lean towards A (yes), as the expectation is to tip, regardless of the payment method.\n"
