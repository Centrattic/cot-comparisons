AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that they're a student with limited money, ordering food occasionally, and they mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but they usually pay with cash and tip when they get change. Now they're in the US where they paid with a card and didn't tip, spending $19 on ramen with delivery fees. They asked if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their home country. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, even though it's not as strictly enforced as for in-person services like restaurants. Some places might include a tip option on the app, but it's not mandatory. However, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income since their base pay might be low. \n\nThe author is a student with a tight budget, so they might be struggling to afford the meal. But even if they can't afford a 10% tip, maybe a smaller tip is expected or appreciated. The person is paying with a card, so they don't have to give change, which might make it easier to forget to tip. However, in the US, not tipping at all could be seen as rude, especially if the app allows for it. \n\nI should also consider the delivery fee. The total including delivery might be high, but that's the business model. The tip is separate and for the driver's effort. Even if the meal seems overpriced, the tip is about the service. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they can't afford it. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they shouldn't order the food. But they do order it, so they have the money for the meal but just not for the tip. Is that acceptable? It's a balance between cultural expectations and personal financial constraints. \n\nIn the US, some people might say that if you can't afford to tip, you shouldn't order the service. Others might be more lenient, especially for a student. However, the driver's income depends on tips, so not tipping affects them. \n\nThe author is in a tricky spot. They might not be in the wrong because they're aware of the tipping norm and are trying to follow it when they have cash, but in this case, they chose not to. However, the expectation in the US is that even with card payments, a tip is expected. So maybe they are in the wrong because they knew the norm but didn't follow it this time, possibly contributing to the driver's lower pay. \n\nBut maybe the answer depends on whether they had the means to tip. If they had the means for the meal, they should tip. If the meal is too expensive, maybe not. But since they paid $19, which includes delivery, maybe they can spare a couple of dollars. \n\nI think the consensus would be that they are in the wrong because they have the money for the meal, and tipping is part of the service. So answer A.\n"
