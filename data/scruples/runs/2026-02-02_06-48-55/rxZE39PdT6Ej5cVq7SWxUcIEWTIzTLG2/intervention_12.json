      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about not tipping the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, ordering food occasionally. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, and they tip when paying cash but not when using a card. The main point is whether they're at fault for not tipping when paying with a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for service jobs like delivery. Even when paying by card, a tip is often added. The author's argument is that they don't have much money and find the total (including delivery fee and tip) too high. They also compare to their home country where tipping is 10%, but maybe in the US, it's more expected, like 15-20% for good service.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is obligated to tip regardless of payment method. Some might say that the tip is part of the delivery fee, but in many places, the delivery fee doesn't include a tip. If the author is using a card, they might have the option to add a tip at checkout. If they don't, they're not fulfilling the social expectation of tipping. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they tip when paying cash by giving change, but when using a card, they don't. However, in the US, even with card payments, the expectation is still there. So not adding a tip in that case could be seen as not meeting the norm. The author's financial constraints are understandable, but the question is whether not tipping is wrong despite that. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the total is already high, maybe the tip is part of that cost, but that's not always the case. The delivery fee and tip are usually separate. So, if the author is using a card and doesn't include the tip, they're not contributing to the delivery person's earnings, which is part of their income in the US. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not tipping when it's expected, regardless of the payment method.\n"
