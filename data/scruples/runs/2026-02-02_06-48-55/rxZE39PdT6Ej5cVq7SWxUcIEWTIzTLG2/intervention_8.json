      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery) high for not much food. They mention in their country, they tip 10% when paying cash, but when using a card, they don't tip. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping when paying by card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus the author's country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even though it's not mandatory. The author comes from a place where tipping is 10% with cash, but they don't do it when using a card. That might be a cultural difference. However, in the US, when using a card, there's usually an option to add a tip, so not tipping in that case could be seen as not following local customs. \n\nBut the author is a student with limited funds. They pay 19$ for ramen, which they think is high. They might be stretching their budget, so maybe they feel they can't afford to tip. However, in the US, tips are part of the delivery driver's income. So not tipping could impact their earnings, especially if the author does this frequently. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be aware of the US tipping etiquette when using cards. Maybe they expected the total to include a tip, but the delivery fee is separate. The question is whether the author is at fault for not knowing or following the US custom. \n\nSo, if the author is in the US, they should adapt to local norms. But if they're in their home country where tipping is different, maybe not. The question doesn't specify the location, but the Reddit-style question implies they're in the US since they mention paying with a card and the US tipping habits. \n\nIn the US, even with a card, you're supposed to tip. If the app or website allows adding a tip, not doing so is considered rude or inconsiderate. So the author is in the wrong for not tipping when using a card, even if they do it when paying cash. \n\nHowever, if they're in a country where tipping is different, but the question is about the US, the answer would lean towards A. But the user's question is phrased as a general situation. Since the author is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer would depend on the local customs. Since the user is asking in the context of the US (as it's a common Reddit-style question), the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author might be in their own country, where the tipping is different. The question is a bit ambiguous. If they're in their country, then not tipping when using a card might not be expected, but if they're in the US, it is. The problem is the lack of clarity. However, the user is asking for an answer based on the given info. The key point is that the author is a student with limited money, but the question is whether not tipping is wrong. \n\nIn the US, tipping is part of the service, so not tipping is wrong. If the author is there, they should tip. If they're not, then maybe not. Since the question is presented as a US context (as in a Reddit post), the answer is A. However, if the author is in their home country, maybe different. But the user's question is phrased as a general case. The answer would be A because in the US, not tipping when you can add it via card is considered wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
