      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a student with limited money. They sometimes order food, which includes a delivery fee, and they end up paying a lot for not much food. The question is about whether not tipping the delivery guy when paying by card is wrong. In their country, they tip 10% when paying cash, but since they're using a card, they don't tip. In the US, tipping is customary, usually around 15-20% for services like delivery, right? \n\nThe author mentions the total they paid was $19 for ramen, which sounds high because the base cost might be lower with delivery fees added. But even if the total is high, the tipping expectation in the US is separate from the delivery fee. Delivery workers often rely on tips as part of their income, especially in the US where their base pay might be low. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that in their country, tipping is 10% with cash, but since they use a card, they don't leave a tip. However, in the US, even when paying by card, tips are expected and sometimes added as a separate line item. The author might not be aware of the different cultural norms here. \n\nBut is the author at fault? They're a student with financial constraints, but the expectation in the US is that tips are part of the service cost. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the worker's income, which might be considered wrong. However, the author is in a different country (assuming the question is about the US) and might not be aware of local customs. Still, if they're using the service in the US, they should follow the local tipping norms. \n\nSo, in the US, not tipping for delivery is generally frowned upon, even with a card. The author's argument about the total being high doesn't negate the tip expectation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if they have financial constraints. But maybe there's a middle ground, like tipping a smaller percentage if they're struggling. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not what they should do next. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, yes, they're in the wrong because they didn't tip despite the cultural expectation. Even if they're a student, the norm is to tip for delivery services, and not doing so is considered rude or unfair to the worker.\n"
