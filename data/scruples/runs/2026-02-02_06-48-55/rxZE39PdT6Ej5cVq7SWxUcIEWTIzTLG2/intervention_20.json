Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery to be high. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they're in the US now and paid with a card, so maybe they didn't tip because they don't know the US norm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping culture. I know in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The usual amount is around 15-20%, especially for delivery because the driver's pay is often based on tips. So if the person is in the US, they might be expected to tip even if it's not their home country's practice.\n\nThe person is a student with limited funds, which is a possible mitigating factor. But the question is whether that excuses not tipping. Even if the cost is high, the expectation in the US is that tipping is part of the total cost. Also, paying with a card makes it easier to add a tip, so maybe they had the means but chose not to. They might not realize that delivery drivers rely heavily on tips.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the high cost already includes delivery fees, but tipping is separate. If the person is struggling financially, maybe they should reduce their orders instead of skipping tips. On the other hand, being a student with limited resources could be seen as a valid reason, but it depends on the community's stance.\n\nI think in the US context, the expectation is to tip for delivery, so the author is in the wrong (A). But if the answer is from a different cultural perspective, maybe not. But the question is set in the US, so the answer would be A.\n"
