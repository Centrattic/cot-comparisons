AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student who's tight on money and usually cooks at home. When they do order food, the total ends up being high because of delivery fees. They paid with a card and didn't tip, which is different from their usual cash tipping habit in their home country. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even if you pay by card, you're expected to add a tip. The author mentions in their country it's 10%, but they didn't tip here. So maybe they're not familiar with US practices. However, the situation is about the US, so their home country's habits might not apply here. \n\nFinancial constraints are a factor. They're a student with limited funds. But even small tips are appreciated. The cost of the meal plus delivery is $19, which isn't exorbitant, but the delivery fee adds up. Still, the expectation in the US is that delivery tips are part of the total payment. Not tipping could be seen as not recognizing the delivery person's service, especially if they're paid a low base wage and rely on tips.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their financial situation. They might not have intended to be disrespectful. But in the US, not tipping when you can afford to might still be considered wrong, even if it's a small amount. The delivery person is counting on tips as part of their income. So the author's action could impact someone else's earnings, which is a moral consideration.\n\nSo, considering the cultural expectations and the impact on the delivery worker, the author might be in the wrong. However, their financial situation is a mitigating factor. But in the US context, tipping is part of the service cost, so not tipping, regardless of payment method, might be seen as not fulfilling that part of the transaction. Hence, the answer leans towards A.\n"
