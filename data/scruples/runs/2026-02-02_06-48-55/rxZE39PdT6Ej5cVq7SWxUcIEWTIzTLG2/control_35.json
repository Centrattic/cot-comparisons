      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. They're a student with limited money, paying $19 for ramen with delivery fees. They usually tip 10% in their country but in the US, maybe it's different. They paid by card, so maybe they didn't have change to leave a tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, it's common to tip around 15-20% for services like delivery. But since the user is a student with a tight budget, maybe they can't afford that. However, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings.\n\nBut the user might not be aware of the US tipping culture. They mentioned their country's 10% rate, which is lower. Also, paying by card might make it harder to tip if they don't have cash. Some apps allow adding a tip digitally, but maybe the user didn't do that. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? On one hand, not tipping could be seen as unfair to the driver. On the other hand, the high cost of the order and their financial situation might be valid reasons. The answer depends on cultural expectations and the user's awareness. If they knew the US norm, they might be in the wrong. If they didn't, maybe not. The question is whether they're expected to tip regardless of payment method. Since they paid with a card, maybe they should still tip through the app. If they didn't, then they're at fault. But if they had no way to tip, maybe not. But generally, in the US, tipping is expected even if paying by card. So the answer might be A, they're in the wrong. But some might argue B because of their situation. Need to check if there's a standard expectation. Also, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The driver's pay might be low, so the tip is important. So the user is in the wrong because they can still tip via card. So answer A.\n"
