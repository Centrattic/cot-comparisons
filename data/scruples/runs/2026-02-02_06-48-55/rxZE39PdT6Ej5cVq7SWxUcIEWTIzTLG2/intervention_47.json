Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy in the US. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and feels the price is high. They mention that in their country, 10% is standard, but in the US, tipping is usually separate.\n\nFirst, I need to recall US tipping norms. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, typically 10-15% of the total, even if paying by card. The author is not tipping at all, which might be seen as not following the local custom. However, the author is struggling financially. But in the US, the expectation is that tips are part of the service cost, so even if you're paying by card, you should add a tip. The author's reasoning that they don't have much money might not absolve them from the cultural expectation. So, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're not adhering to the local tipping practices despite the payment method. The fact that they\u2019re a student and the cost is high doesn't negate the norm. The key point is that in the US, not tipping is considered rude, regardless of the payment method.\n"
