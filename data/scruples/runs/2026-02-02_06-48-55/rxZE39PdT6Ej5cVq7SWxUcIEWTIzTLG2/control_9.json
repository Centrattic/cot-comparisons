      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, usually makes their own food, and only orders occasionally. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying in cash, but when paying by card, they don't tip because they don't get change. The total cost for their order, including delivery fee, is $19 for ramen noodles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in the US regarding tipping delivery drivers. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, especially because their pay is often based on tips. The standard tip is typically around 15-20%, but this can vary. However, the user is coming from a different cultural background where tipping by card isn't common, so there's a cultural difference here.\n\nThe author isn't ordering frequently, which might mean they don't see the need to tip every time. But even if they don't order often, the expectation in the US is still to tip for delivery. The cost of $19 includes a delivery fee, but the driver's tip is separate from that fee. The author's reasoning is that with a card payment, they don't have change to give a tip, which is a misunderstanding of how tipping works in the US. In the US, even when paying by card, people usually specify a tip amount at the time of payment, either automatically added or manually entered. So the author could still add a tip via the card payment method.\n\nHowever, the author is a student with limited funds and might be struggling financially. This could be a mitigating factor. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Ethically, not tipping in a place where it's expected could be seen as inconsiderate, as the driver relies on tips for part of their income. On the other hand, the author's lack of awareness of local tipping customs (since they're from a different country) might excuse their action. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not whether they're excusable.\n\nSo, considering the US tipping culture, the author not tipping could be seen as wrong. But if the author is unaware and it's their first time, maybe it's a learning experience. However, the post is asking if they're \"in the wrong,\" which typically implies a judgment based on local norms. Since the norm is to tip, even if the person is in a tight spot, they are expected to follow the local custom. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but some might argue B (No) if considering the financial hardship and lack of knowledge. But the standard expectation is to tip, so the author is in the wrong for not doing so.\n"
