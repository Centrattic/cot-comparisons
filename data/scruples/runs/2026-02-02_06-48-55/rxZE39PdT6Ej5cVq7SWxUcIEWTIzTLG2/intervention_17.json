It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy when they paid with a card. The author is a student with limited money and orders food occasionally. The total came to $19 for ramen, which seems high to them. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but in the US, tipping is customary, usually around 15-20%. The question is whether they should tip even when paying by card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income because their base pay is low. Even when paying by card, many restaurants add a tip automatically or have a digital tip option. So not tipping in that case might be seen as not following the norm, especially if the customer can afford it. The author's reasoning is that they don't have much money, but they do order food sometimes. Paying $19 for ramen might be expensive, but if they're choosing to spend that money, they could still tip a small amount. \n\nHowever, arguments against might say that if the customer is truly struggling financially, they shouldn't be expected to tip. But the key here is that the author chose to order the food. If they can afford to order, they can afford to tip, even a small amount. Also, not tipping might hurt the delivery person's income. So the author might be in the wrong because they're benefiting from the service and should contribute to the driver's earnings. But the amount is small, so the judgment might be nuanced. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not how bad it is. Since the norm in the US includes tipping, even when paying by card, not doing so could be considered wrong.\n"
