AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and in their country, it's 10% tip when paying cash. However, they pay with a card and didn't tip because they found the total price, including delivery, too high for the food amount. They paid $19 for ramen noodles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author mentions their country's 10% tip, but they're in the US now, where tipping for delivery is common, even with card payments. Delivery workers often rely on tips as part of their income, especially in the US. So even if they pay by card, not tipping might be seen as not following local customs.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that the price was high for the amount of food. But delivery fees and tips are separate. The delivery fee is usually for the delivery service, not the driver's pay. Tips are for the driver's labor. So even if the food's price is high, the tip is a separate matter.\n\nFinancial constraints are a factor, but the user is a student, and maybe they should consider splitting the tip or tipping a smaller amount if they can. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all for delivery could be seen as wrong, even if they're on a budget. The author might not be in the wrong if they explain the situation, but the act itself could be considered wrong.\n\nBut the answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Considering US norms, the expectation might be to tip for delivery unless it's optional. If the author didn't tip, they might be in the wrong. However, the user is from another country where cash tips are standard, so maybe they're unaware of US customs. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about ignorance. So maybe A is correct.\n"
