      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. So, the situation is they're a student with limited money, rarely order food, and when they do, the total ends up being high due to delivery fees. They mention they usually tip 10% in their country when paying cash but don't tip when using a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The US typically expects a tip of 15-20% for services like delivery, right? So maybe the author, coming from a country where 10% is standard, is used to a lower tipping norm. That could be part of the issue. But the question is about the US context here.\n\nIn the US, tipping delivery drivers is customary, even if you pay by card. Some places might automatically add a tip, but if not, it's usually expected. The author might not know this expectation, especially if they're a student in the US and just arrived from another country. Their reasoning is that they don't have much money and the price feels high. But the total being $19 might still be within a reasonable range for delivery, considering the fees. However, whether the tip is necessary is the key.\n\nThe author isn't tipping when using a card, which might be because they're not used to the system. In some countries, you tip in cash for change, but in the US, you can add a tip via the card payment. If they don't do that, the delivery person might not get a tip. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not following the local tipping custom, even if they're from a country where it's different. But they might be in a situation of financial constraint as a student, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nHowever, the act of not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the service worker's income when they're supposed to. So even if the author is from a country with different norms, once they're in the US, participating in the local tipping culture is expected. But maybe they're not aware of how to tip via card. Some systems allow you to add a tip at the time of payment. If they don't know how, they might not tip by mistake. But if they do know but choose not to, that's different.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the expectation in the US is to tip regardless of payment method, and if the author is aware of that. If the author is unaware, maybe they're not at fault. But if they're aware and still choose not to tip, then they could be in the wrong. The post doesn't specify if they know about US tipping norms. They mention they don't know how much is usual in the US, so they might be in a state of ignorance here. However, the expectation is still there, so maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they're not adhering to the local custom. But if they're a student from another country and just don't know, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a bit of a toss-up. The key points are the cultural expectation vs. individual circumstances.\n"
