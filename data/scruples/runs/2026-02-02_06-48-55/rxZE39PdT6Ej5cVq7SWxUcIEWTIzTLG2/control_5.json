      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally, but ends up paying a lot, like $19 for ramen with delivery fees. They mention in their country they tip 10%, but in the US, they're unsure. They paid with a card, so maybe they can't just add cash tips. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery services, often around 15-20%, especially if there's no tip option on the card payment. Even though the total might seem high, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author might not realize that the tip is expected even when paying by card. So, in the US, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate because delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income.\n\nHowever, the author is a student with limited money and might not have the means to tip. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The argument for A (wrong) is that they didn't tip despite the US norm. The argument for B (not wrong) is their financial situation. But the key here is that the tip is part of the driver's compensation. Even in a tight budget, maybe a small tip is expected. The author might be unaware of the US tipping culture. But regardless, the question is whether they're in the wrong. So the answer would lean towards A because they didn't tip, even if they can't give cash, they could still add a tip via card. So the answer is likely A."
