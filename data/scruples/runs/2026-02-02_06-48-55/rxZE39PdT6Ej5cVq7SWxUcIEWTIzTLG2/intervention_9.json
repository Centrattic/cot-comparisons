AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy, especially as a student with limited money. The author mentions that they're paying with a card and the total seems high because of the delivery fee. They also mention that in their country, 10% is standard, but they're in the US now.\n\nIn the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually around 10-15%, sometimes more. The author is not tipping because they think it's expensive and they're a student. They ordered food once in a while, which they can afford. The question is, is it wrong not to tip?\n\nWell, in the US, tips are considered part of the service workers' income. So even if you're using a card, you're expected to add a tip. The delivery person relies on that. The author is avoiding tipping because they think the total is high, but that's part of the service. They can adjust the tip amount if they can't afford 10-15%, maybe 5% or even a flat dollar amount. However, not tipping at all could be seen as rude or unfair since the delivery person's income depends on it. \n\nThe author is in a position where they're making a choice not to tip, which the delivery person might not get from others. Even though they're a student, in the US culture, not tipping is generally frowned upon. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a counterpoint about financial constraints. However, the author can still tip a smaller amount if possible. Not tipping entirely is a choice that affects the worker's earnings. So I think the answer is A.\n"
