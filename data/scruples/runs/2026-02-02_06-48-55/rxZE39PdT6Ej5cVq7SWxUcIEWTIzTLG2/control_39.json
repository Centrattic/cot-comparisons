      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total cost including delivery fees high. They mention in their country it's 10%, but in the US, maybe that's different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Usually, it's around 15-20%, but some people might tip less if they can't afford it. The person is a student, so their financial situation is tight. They paid with a card, which might make it harder to tip since they're not getting change. If they usually tip when paying cash, but not with card, maybe they don't know how to do it through the app or website. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The total being $19 seems high for ramen, but maybe that's because of the delivery fee and markup. The person is questioning if they're at fault for not tipping in this scenario. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on cultural expectations. In the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, but if they're struggling financially, that's a mitigating factor. However, even small tips can be appreciated. The author might not be aware that tipping is expected here. Alternatively, maybe they thought the delivery fee included a tip, but that's not typically the case. \n\nSo, is it A or B? If the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A), it's because they should tip if they can, even a small amount. If B, then they're not wrong because of their financial situation and lack of awareness about US tipping practices. I think the answer leans towards B because the person is in a difficult financial situation and might not know the norms, so they aren't in the wrong. But some might argue that they should at least try to tip something. Hmm. Need to check if the question is about right or wrong based on norms. Since the user is in a different country where tipping is 10%, but in the US it's higher. If they didn't tip at all, maybe they're in the wrong. But if they can't afford it, maybe not. The answer is probably B.\n"
