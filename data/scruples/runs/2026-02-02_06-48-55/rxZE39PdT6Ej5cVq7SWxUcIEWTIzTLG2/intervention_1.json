AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

They mention tipping 10% in their country, but in the US, tipping is usually 15-20%. They paid by card, so maybe didn't tip.\n\nHmm. The key points here: the author's financial situation, their understanding of tipping norms in the US vs their home country, and whether not tipping is wrong. In the US, tipping is expected for delivery services, even if paid by card. So not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, but the author is struggling with the cost. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Even if they can't afford it, maybe they should tip a small amount. Alternatively, maybe they're not at fault because they're unaware of the US norms. But the general consensus is that tipping is expected, so not doing so might be considered wrong. So probably answer A.\n"
