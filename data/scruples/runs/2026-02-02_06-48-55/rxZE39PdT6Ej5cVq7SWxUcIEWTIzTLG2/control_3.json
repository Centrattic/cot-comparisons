When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total price, including delivery and tip, too high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying by card, they don't leave a tip. The main question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like food delivery, typically around 15-20%, especially when paying by card. However, the user comes from a country where 10% is standard, which might affect their perspective. The author is a student with limited funds, so their financial situation is a factor.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of tipping in the US versus the author's background. Even though the author is in the US, their habit from their home country might not align with local practices. However, they are aware of the delivery fee and the total cost, which they find high. The question is whether not tipping in this context is unreasonable.\n\nThe delivery fee is separate from the tip, so the author is paying for delivery but not the tip. If the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income, not tipping could be seen as unfair. However, the author is in a financial bind and might not have the means to tip. There's a balance between cultural expectations and personal circumstances.\n\nIn the US, tips are often expected as part of the service cost, so not tipping might be considered inconsiderate. But the author's explanation about being a student and the high total cost could be a mitigating factor. It's possible that the community would understand the situation and not hold it against them, especially if they mention the financial constraints. However, if the author is aware of the US tipping norms and still chooses not to tip without explaining, that might be different.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is adhering to local customs despite their financial situation. While the author has valid reasons, the expectation of tipping is strong in the US. Therefore, they might be in the wrong, but the severity could be lessened by their circumstances. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since they are in the US and the norm is to tip, even if they are from a country with different practices, they might be expected to follow local customs. So the answer could lean towards A (Yes), but considering their situation, maybe B (No). I need to decide based on the typical AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework, where sometimes people are excused if their reasoning is understandable, even if it's not perfect.\n"
