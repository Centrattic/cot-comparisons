      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery and tip) too high. They mention that in their country, 10% is standard, but when paying with a card, they don't tip, leading to the question of whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in the US. In the US, tipping delivery drivers is common, often expected, and sometimes even built into the system with automatic suggestions. The typical range is 15-20%, but it can vary. The author is used to tipping with cash, which makes sense because cash transactions make it easier to add change as a tip. However, when paying by card, especially if it's a contactless or digital transaction, the author might not tip because they don't have physical cash to round up. That's a practical issue.\n\nBut the key point is whether not tipping the delivery guy is considered wrong here. The author is a student with financial constraints, and the cost adds up. The delivery fee and the food price make the total $19 for ramen noodles. That seems high, but the question is about the tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping when using a card.\n\nIn the US, it's generally expected that you tip delivery drivers, even if you pay by card. Many apps and services now have a tip section built into the payment process, so the user can add a tip before finalizing the payment. If the author didn't do that, maybe they just overlooked it, or they're not aware of the expectation. However, the user is justifying it by saying they don't tip when using a card, which might be a misunderstanding of the local customs.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they tip 10% in their country, but in the US, the expectation might be higher. Also, the delivery driver's income often relies on tips, so not tipping could be seen as unfair. However, the author's financial situation is a factor. They are a student, so their income is limited, and the meal's total cost is a concern.\n\nBut in the US, even small tips are appreciated. Maybe the author could tip a smaller percentage, say $1 or $2, which is common even for lower amounts. The fact that they paid with a card shouldn't be an excuse if the platform allows adding a tip. So, from a cultural standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip, even if it's a small amount. However, if the platform didn't allow tipping, that's a different scenario. But the author didn't mention that; they just said they paid with their card. It's possible that they didn't know how to tip through the app or didn't consider it. Still, the expectation is there, so not tipping could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the high total cost is unreasonable, and expecting a tip on top of that is unfair. But the standard practice in many service industries in the US does include tipping as part of the cost. Therefore, the author's failure to tip, despite the high cost, might be considered inconsiderate to the delivery driver.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because tipping is expected, especially when using a card where the option is available. Their financial situation is a mitigating factor, but the norm still holds that a tip should be given.\n"
