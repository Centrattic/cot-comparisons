      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They mention ordering food occasionally and being upset about the total cost including delivery fees. They paid with a card, which might make tipping less immediate. In their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they don't tip in the US because they didn't give cash. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping.\n\nI know in the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even if you pay by card, there's usually a section on the app or website to add a tip. So maybe the author didn't know how to tip via card. But the key point here is that the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income, especially in the US where service workers often have low base wages. \n\nThe author is justifying not tipping because they're a student and the cost was high. But even with financial constraints, a small tip (like 5-10%) is expected. Also, not tipping at all could be seen as neglecting a part of the service staff's income. However, if the author wasn't aware of US tipping norms, maybe that's a factor. But since they mentioned knowing the 10% norm in their country, they might be expected to adapt to US practices when in the US. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on personal financial situation and confusion about US tipping. But the expectation in the US is that you tip for delivery services, regardless of payment method. Therefore, not tipping could be considered wrong because it affects the delivery person's earnings. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
