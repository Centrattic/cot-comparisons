AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The user is a student with limited money, which probably affects their ability to tip. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but they're in the US now, where tipping is usually expected more, like 15-20% for services. But they paid with a card, not cash, so maybe they didn't get the chance to leave a tip? Or maybe the app didn't let them add a tip automatically? \n\nWait, in the US, many delivery services now require a tip, either through the app or at the time of payment. Some places might add a tip as part of the total. If the user didn't leave any tip, maybe that's considered rude or unfair because delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income.\n\nHowever, the user is in a financial situation where they can't afford to tip, and they're paying a lot already for their order. They feel the total is too high, including delivery fees. So, they might not have the means to leave a tip on top of that. But in the US, even if you pay with a card, you can add a tip through the payment method. So maybe the author had the option to tip but chose not to, and that's where the conflict is.\n\nIf the user didn't realize that tipping is expected here, they might be in the wrong for not knowing the local customs. But if the app didn't allow tipping or they were unaware, maybe it's not their fault. The question is whether they intentionally didn't tip or if there was a misunderstanding. Since they paid with a card, maybe they didn't know how to add a tip. If the app required a tip as part of the process, then not adding it would be their fault. But if the app didn't make it obvious, maybe it's not. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee might already include some part of the driver's pay, but tips are separate. So, the driver might still rely on the tip. The user's situation is similar to others who can't afford to tip, but in the US, tipping is a social norm. So, even if they can't afford it, they might still be expected to give something, even a smaller percentage, like $1 or $2. But if they can't do that, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are: the user is a student with limited funds, the country's tipping culture is different, and the method of payment (card vs cash). If they didn't know they had to tip with a card, maybe they're not at fault. But in the US, it's generally expected to include a tip when paying with a card, especially for delivery. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because not tipping is against the norm here, regardless of their financial situation. However, if they had no way to tip, maybe not. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not just the circumstances. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
