      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) too high for the amount of food they get. They're wondering if they should tip even though they paid with a card and are used to tipping 10% in their home country.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services, especially in the food industry. For delivery, it's common to tip around 15-20% of the total order cost, but this can vary. The person mentions paying $19 for ramen, which sounds a bit high, but that's their own perception. They might feel the delivery fee is part of the cost, but in the US, delivery fees are separate from the tip. So, the tip is usually on top of the food and delivery fee. \n\nThe person is confused because in their home country, tipping 10% when paying cash is standard. But in the US, the expectation is higher, especially when paying by card. When paying with cash, you can adjust the tip based on the change, but with a card, the tip is added at the time of payment. If they didn't add a tip when paying by card, that might be the issue. \n\nThe arguments against them: Tipping is part of the delivery driver's income in the US. Not tipping could be seen as taking advantage of their service. Even if the total seems high, the driver doesn't set the food or delivery fee, so not tipping them could affect their earnings. \n\nArguments for them: They are a student with limited funds. The cost seems disproportionate to the food's value. They might not be aware of US tipping norms. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether they should have known. \n\nSo, the person is in the wrong because they didn't leave a tip, which is expected in the US for delivery services, regardless of the total cost. Even if they're tight on money, tipping is a way to show appreciation for the service. The driver's income relies on tips, so not tipping is considered rude or inconsiderate. The fact that they paid by card doesn't excuse not tipping. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
