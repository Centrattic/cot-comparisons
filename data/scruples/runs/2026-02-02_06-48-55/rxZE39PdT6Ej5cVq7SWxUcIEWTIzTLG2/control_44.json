      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, they tip 10% when paying cash, but since they used a card here, they didn't tip. They paid $19 for ramen noodles, which they think is expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms regarding tipping in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, usually around 15-20%, especially when paying electronically because it's easier to forget or not have change. The user might not be aware of this expectation. However, the user is from a different country where the norm might be different (they mentioned 10% when paying cash). \n\nThe user's reasoning is that when they paid cash, they tipped, but with a card, they didn't. But in the US, even with cards, tipping is expected because delivery drivers rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The total cost might seem high, but that includes delivery fees, not just the food. The user's financial constraints are a factor, but the question is whether not tipping is wrong. \n\nSo, if the user didn't tip at all because they used a card, which is common in the US for electronic payments to include tips, then they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they intended to tip but just forgot, that's different. But the user explicitly says they didn't tip because they paid with a card, implying they didn't add a tip. In that case, the answer would be yes (A), as they didn't meet the local tipping norm. However, if they were unaware of the expectation, maybe that's a grey area. But according to the question, the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the answer would depend on the US standards. Since they didn't tip despite being able to add a tip digitally, that's considered wrong in the US context.\n"
