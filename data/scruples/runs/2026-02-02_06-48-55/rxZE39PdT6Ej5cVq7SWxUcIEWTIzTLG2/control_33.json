AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think about this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, and they feel the total is too high because of delivery fees and the price of the food. They mention in their country it's 10%, and when they pay cash, they tip with the change. But when using a card, they don't tip.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, usually around 15-20%, especially for services like delivery. Even though the person might not have much money, the expectation in the US is different. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate because delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the person is a student and might be unaware of local customs. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are the cultural difference and the person's financial situation. While the student's perspective is valid, the standard in the US does include tipping. So, even if they're not in the same system as their home country, they're still in the US and should follow local norms. However, sometimes people argue that if the service is poor, they might not tip, but the person didn't mention the service being bad. They just didn't tip because of the cost. \n\nBut the cost is part of the system here. The delivery fee and high prices are part of the business model. The tip is separate from that. So even if the total is high, the tip is still expected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, despite the cost. But there's also a counterargument that if someone is struggling financially, they might not be expected to tip as much, but the norm is still there. \n\nSo the answer could be A (in the wrong) because they didn't follow local customs. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if considering their financial situation. But generally, in the US, not tipping is seen as wrong regardless of personal financial issues. So probably A.\n"
