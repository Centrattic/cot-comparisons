      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, pays with a card, and finds the total including delivery fee expensive. They mention in their country the tip is 10%, but they didn't tip here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms in the US. I know in the US, especially for services like delivery, tipping is customary but not mandatory. The common tip is around 15-20%, but it can vary. However, the author is coming from a country where 10% is standard, so they might be adjusting their expectations.\n\nThe author is paying with a card, and since the delivery fee is included, maybe they don't see the need to add a tip. But in the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income since their pay might be lower. So even if the total seems high, the tip is a separate consideration. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about financial constraints. They mention being a student with limited funds. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the norm in the US requires tipping regardless of payment method. Since the author is in the US now, they might be expected to follow local customs. \n\nBut there's also the argument that if they're using a card, they can specify a tip amount, and if they choose not to, it's their choice. However, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not tipping. If the norm is to tip, then not doing so could be seen as in the wrong. But if the question is about whether it's morally wrong, some might argue that it's the customer's choice, especially if they're struggling financially.\n\nBut in the US, there's a social expectation to tip, even if it's not mandatory. The author might be in the wrong for not contributing, even if they find the total high. The delivery fee is separate from the tip. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite the local custom. However, others might say it's not their fault if they're unaware of the norms. But since the post is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer would depend on the expectation of tipping in the US.\n"
