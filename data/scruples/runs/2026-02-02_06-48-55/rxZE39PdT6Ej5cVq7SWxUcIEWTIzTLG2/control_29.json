      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they tip when they get change. However, when using a card, they didn't tip. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole\" (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context here. The key points are the author's financial situation as a student, the cost structure of the delivery (high delivery fee), and the method of payment (card vs. cash). In the US, tipping is customary for delivery services, typically around 15-20%, but this can vary. However, the author is comparing it to their home country's 10% standard, which might be different from US expectations.\n\nThe main issue is whether not tipping is wrong. In the US, delivery tips are separate from the delivery fee and are meant to compensate the delivery person for their service. If the author is using a card, they might not be as inclined to leave a tip because it's not as immediate as cash. However, the expectation in the US is that you should still tip, regardless of payment method. The author's reasoning is that the total cost is high, so they feel it's \"absurd\" to pay that much. But that's conflating the delivery fee with the tip. The delivery fee goes to the company, while the tip is for the delivery person. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their financial situation. Students often have limited funds, and it's possible they don't have the budget to add an extra tip when using a card. But the ethical question is whether they should tip regardless. Some might argue that in the US, tipping is part of the service cost, so not tipping is expected to be wrong. Others might sympathize with the student's situation, especially if they are making an effort to make their own food most of the time and only ordering occasionally. \n\nThe answer might hinge on cultural norms. If the author is not from the US and is using their home country's tipping standards, they might not be aware that US tipping is higher. However, when in a different country, it's usually expected to follow local customs. Since they are in the US (as per the context of the question), not tipping could be seen as disrespectful or unfair to the delivery person who relies on tips for a significant portion of their income. \n\nBut the author is also pointing out that the total cost is high. It's possible they feel the delivery fee is already a form of tip, but that's not accurate. The delivery fee is separate. So, in that case, the author's decision not to tip could be seen as not paying for the service rendered to them by the delivery person. \n\nHowever, the author's situation is also understandable. They are a student with limited funds. If they are only ordering occasionally, maybe they can afford to tip occasionally as well. The question is whether the act of not tipping in this specific case is wrong. If they are in the US, and the tip is expected, then the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But if they are unaware of the cultural norms or are making a conscious choice based on their financial constraints, some might argue B (not in the wrong). \n\nIt's a bit of a balance between cultural expectations and personal circumstances. The key here is that the author is not ordering frequently and is a student, which might mitigate the expectation. However, the delivery person's reliance on tips is a factor. In many service industries, especially in the US, tips are a crucial part of income. So not tipping could be seen as withholding a part of their pay. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A, they are in the wrong, because despite their financial situation, tipping is expected as part of the service. However, others might argue it's a situational issue where the author isn't the asshole but should consider the local norms next time. But given the question's structure, the answer is likely A or B based on the standard expectation.\n"
