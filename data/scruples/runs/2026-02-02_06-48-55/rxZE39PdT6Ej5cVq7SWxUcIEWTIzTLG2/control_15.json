      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they ordered food which ended up costing $19, including delivery fees. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they paid with a card and didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their home country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often 15-20%, especially for cashless payments. If they paid with a card, the tip is usually added there. Not tipping in this context might be seen as rude or unfair by the delivery person, who relies on tips as part of their income.\n\nHowever, the user's argument is that they don't have much money and the total cost seems high. But delivery fees and restaurant pricing often account for various costs. While their financial situation is challenging, the expectation in the US is still to tip, even if it's a small amount. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for not tipping despite these norms.\n\nI should also consider that the delivery person's income depends on tips. Not tipping could affect their earnings, making the user responsible for not contributing to that. On the other hand, the user might not be aware of US tipping customs, but the question is about their responsibility in the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (they're in the wrong) because US norms expect tipping, especially with card payments. However, there's a nuance if they're unaware, but the general expectation still holds. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
