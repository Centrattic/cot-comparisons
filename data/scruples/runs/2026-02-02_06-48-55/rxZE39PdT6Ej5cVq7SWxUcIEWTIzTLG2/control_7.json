When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is a student in the US who's not sure about tipping norms. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but when paying with a card, they didn't tip because they're tight on money. The total came out to $19 for ramen with delivery fees.\n\nFirst, I need to recall common tipping practices in the US. Typically, 15-20% is standard for good service. But delivery tips might be lower, like $2-5. Since they paid with a card, maybe they didn't add a tip through the app, which is common now. The user is a student, so financial constraints might be a factor. However, tipping is expected in the US, even for delivery. Not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair to the delivery person, who relies on tips as part of their income. The delivery fee is separate from the tip, so the user might not realize the delivery person isn't getting paid well without a tip. On the other hand, the user might not know US norms and is from a country where tipping is different. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. So, even if they didn't know, the standard here is to tip. So the answer might be A (they're in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. Wait, the user is asking for AITA (am I the asshole). The community would likely say they should tip, even if they can only afford a small amount. So the answer is A.\n"
