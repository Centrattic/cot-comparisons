      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee and tip) to be too high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying by card, they don't leave a tip, whereas with cash they do. The main question is whether not tipping in this case makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is a common practice, especially for services like delivery. However, the person is from a country where 10% is the norm. They might be less familiar with US tipping customs. But since they're in the US (as implied by the question about US tipping practices), they might be expected to follow local norms. \n\nThe person is a student with limited funds. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which seems high. The delivery fee and total cost are factors here. They might feel the total is unreasonable, but the question is about tipping specifically. \n\nIn the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income, sometimes even expecting it. Not tipping could be seen as stingy, but if the person is unaware of the local custom, especially if they're from a different country, that might mitigate some blame. However, the fact that they do tip when paying cash suggests they understand the concept of tipping, so maybe they're just choosing not to when using a card. \n\nSome might argue that the cost of delivery already includes some overhead, but tips are separate. The person might be trying to save money by not tipping, but the driver might rely on that tip. \n\nHowever, the person is also being honest about their financial situation. It's possible that they're not malicious but just trying to manage their expenses. In some cases, people might not tip if they feel the service is poor, but the scenario here doesn't mention any issue with the delivery service. \n\nThe key points are the cultural expectation in the US, the person's awareness of tipping (since they do it with cash), and their financial constraints. If they're following their home country's norms where 10% is standard but in the US it's more common to tip 15-20%, then maybe they're under-tipping. However, if the total is already high, they might be just trying to cut costs. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If the US expectation is higher, then not tipping (even if they're used to 10% elsewhere) might be seen as wrong. But if they're a student with limited funds, others might empathize. It's a bit of a gray area. I think some might say they're being stingy, others might understand their situation. But in terms of AITA, the community often leans on whether the person acted inconsiderately. If they didn't tip despite knowing the local custom (even if they're from another country, once they\u2019re in the US they might be expected to follow local norms), then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if they\u2019re not aware, but since they do tip with cash, they might be aware but just not doing it when using a card. Maybe they\u2019re in the wrong for not tipping in the US context, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
