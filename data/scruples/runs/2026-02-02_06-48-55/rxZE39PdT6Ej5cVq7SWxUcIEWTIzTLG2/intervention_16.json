      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention in their country it's 10%, but in the US, maybe that's different. They paid with a card, which might make tipping less automatic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the US tipping culture. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, usually 15-20%, sometimes 10-15% if the service is good. The author might be coming from a country where 10% is standard, but maybe in the US, expecting even 15% here could be considered lower. However, the author is a student with limited funds. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If they didn't tip at all, some might say it's rude or unfair to the delivery person, especially if the delivery person's income relies on tips. On the other hand, the author is in a financial situation where they can't afford it, and maybe they're not aware of US tipping norms. \n\nBut the author mentions they usually tip when paying cash, giving change as a tip. Since they used a card, maybe they didn't have the opportunity to tip, but in the US, card payments usually allow for adding a tip. The author might have chosen not to tip, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author is in a different country (assuming they're not in the US) but the question is about US norms. Wait, the original post is in the US context, I think. The user mentions \"in the US but in my country...\" So the situation is in the US, but the author's country has different norms. \n\nSo in the US, not tipping at all would be considered wrong. Even if the total is high, the expectation is still there. The author's financial situation might be a mitigating factor, but the general consensus in the US is that tipping is part of the service cost. \n\nBut the author might not know that. However, since they're using a card, they probably have the option to add a tip. So if they didn't, even a small one, they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they added a small tip, maybe 10%, but in the US, that's sometimes considered low, but better than nothing. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is seen as wrong. If they didn't tip at all, then yes, they are in the wrong. If they added a small tip but still didn't follow US norms, maybe not entirely, but the scenario says they didn't tip. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because in the US, not tipping is generally seen as rude, regardless of financial situation. However, there might be arguments about their financial constraints, but the expectation is still there.\n"
