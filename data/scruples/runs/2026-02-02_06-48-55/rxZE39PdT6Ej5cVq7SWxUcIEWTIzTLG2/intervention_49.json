It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They don't order food often and usually cook themselves. When they do order, they pay with a card and end up with high costs, like $19 for ramen. They mention in their country it's 10%, but in the US, tipping is usually separate from the total. The question is whether not tipping is wrong.\n\nIn the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, even if you pay by card. Many people consider a 15-20% tip standard. The author might be confused because in their home country, service charges are included or expected differently. However, in the US, not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair since the driver's income often relies on tips. \n\nBut the author is a student with financial constraints. They might not have the means to tip as expected. However, even small tips are appreciated. The key point here is cultural expectations vs. personal circumstances. While the author is in a tough spot, the norm in the US is to tip, so not tipping could be seen as wrong, but maybe not in a malicious way. It's a mix of cultural understanding and personal situation. Still, the act of not tipping, even if due to financial reasons, might be considered in the wrong by some standards. So leaning towards A, but with nuance.\n"
