      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays with a card. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with cash, they give the tip as change. However, when using a card, they didn't tip, leading to a total of $19 for ramen. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. The person is a student with financial constraints, which is a common situation. They're comparing their home country's 10% tip to the US practice. Since they paid with a card, maybe they didn't know how the tipping works through the app\u2014some services automatically add a tip, but if they didn't, the user might not have realized they should add it manually. The total amount seems high because of delivery fees, which are separate from the tip. The person isn't being selfish but is possibly unaware of the tipping norms here. So, the answer might hinge on whether the person should have known to tip, even with a card. However, since they didn't have change to tip when using cash, maybe they assumed it's the same with card payments. The key points are intent, knowledge of local norms, and financial constraints. If they're a student and not aware of US tipping practices, they might not be in the wrong. But if they should have known, maybe they are. Since the question is about the US, and the person is from another country, it's possible they weren't aware. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
