AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the delivery person. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and is paying around $19 for a delivery that includes a delivery fee. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but when using a card, they don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping practices in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, especially in restaurants. The standard tip is typically 15-20%, but it can vary. However, the author is coming from a country where tipping is 10% with cash, which they might not be applying when paying by card.\n\nThe key points here are the author's financial situation and the cost of the meal. They mention that the total cost is high relative to the food received. However, even if the meal is overpriced, the expectation of a tip in the US remains. The author's reasoning is that they don't tip when paying with a card because they're not handling cash. But in many places, especially in the US, tipping via card is common and expected. If the restaurant has a system where you can add a tip through the card, the author should still include it.\n\nThe user is wondering if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author is aware of the tipping norms in the US and if they're choosing to ignore them despite their financial constraints. While the author might be tight on money, the cultural expectation here is that a tip is part of the payment for service. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the service cost is high. However, some might argue that the total cost being too high justifies not tipping. But generally, the service is part of the delivery, so the tip is for the delivery person's work.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong (A) because they are not adhering to the tipping norms in the US, even though they're using a different standard from their home country. The financial situation is a factor, but the expectation of tipping persists regardless.\n"
