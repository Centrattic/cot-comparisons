      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a student with limited money. They don't order food often, maybe once in a while. The main issue is that they paid with a card and didn't leave a tip, which they feel is a lot (like $19 for ramen). They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, which they give when paying cash. But when using a card, they don't tip. The question is if they're wrong for not tipping in the US context.\n\nI need to consider US tipping customs. In the US, especially for delivery, a tip is expected. Even though the total might seem high, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. So if you pay with a card, it's common to add a tip at the time of payment. If you don't, the driver doesn't get that extra. \n\nBut the person's reasoning is that they're a student with limited funds. The question is whether that justifies not tipping. On one hand, the US tipping culture is such that not tipping is considered rude. On the other hand, the person is in a financial bind. However, even small tips are appreciated. Maybe there's a middle ground, like leaving a small percentage instead of the standard 10-15% in the US. \n\nThe situation here is that the author didn't tip at all when using a card. In the US, when paying by card, you're usually prompted to add a tip. If you don't, the driver gets nothing. So the author's action of not tipping could be seen as not adhering to local customs, which might make them \"in the wrong\" according to the AITA standards. However, their financial situation is a mitigating factor. \n\nBut the community might argue that even a small tip is better. The author might not realize that in the US, the tip is a significant part of the delivery person's earnings. So not tipping could be seen as withholding a necessary part of their pay. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong). However, others might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they're a student with limited funds and didn't tip in their own country's way. But since they're in the US, local customs apply. \n\nI think the consensus would be that they are in the wrong because they didn't follow the US tipping norm, even if they have financial constraints. So answer A.\n"
