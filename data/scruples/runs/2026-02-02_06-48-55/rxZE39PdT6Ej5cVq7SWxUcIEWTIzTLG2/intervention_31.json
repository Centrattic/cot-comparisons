AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's see. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays by card. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when they pay cash, they tip during change. But when using a card, they don't tip, leading to a $19 total for ramen. They're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery, typically around 15-20%. However, the author is from a country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware that US tipping practices are higher. Also, they're a student with financial constraints, which is a valid reason for their hesitation. \n\nThe key points are: the author's different cultural background, their financial situation, and the method of payment (card vs. cash). Since they pay by card, maybe the tipping process is automatic or not as straightforward, leading them to not tip. But in the US, even with card payments, tipping is expected. However, the author might not know that. \n\nIs it fair to say they're in the wrong? They might not be aware of the local norms. But on the other hand, once in the US, it's customary to follow local practices. The author's reasoning is understandable, but not tipping in the US could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the fact that they tip when paying cash shows they're willing to tip when it's easier, just not with card. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because of their lack of knowledge and financial constraints. But some might argue that they should adapt to US norms. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the cultural difference and financial situation are valid excuses.\n"
