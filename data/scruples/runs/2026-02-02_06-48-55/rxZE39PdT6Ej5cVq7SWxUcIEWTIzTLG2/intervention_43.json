AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're a student with limited money, they order food occasionally, and they paid with a card. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when paying cash, they tip when given change. But here, they didn't tip because they paid with a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. While the user's home country might have different norms, they're in the US now. Tipping delivery in the US is generally expected, even if it's not mandatory. The delivery fee might be separate from the tip, which is why the total seems high. \n\nThe user is a student with limited funds, which is understandable. However, tipping is part of the service cost in the US. Not tipping could be seen as withholding a part of the delivery person's income, especially since the delivery person's pay is often based on tips. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the user is being honest about their financial situation. Maybe they didn't know the local tipping customs. However, since they mentioned knowing that in their country tipping is 10%, they might be aware that tipping is expected elsewhere. \n\nSo, while the user's situation is sympathetic, not tipping in the US where it's expected could be considered inconsiderate. The answer would likely be that they are in the wrong (A), but there's some nuance because of their financial constraints. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy.\n"
