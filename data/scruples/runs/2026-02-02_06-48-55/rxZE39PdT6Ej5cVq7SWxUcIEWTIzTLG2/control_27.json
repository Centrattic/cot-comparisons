      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is about a student in the US who's used to tipping 10% in their home country but doesn't have much money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The usual range is around 15-20%, sometimes even more for good service. The person here is not tipping because they're a student with limited funds, and they find the total price (including delivery) high for the food they get.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. Even if they can't afford it, in the US, not tipping at all might be seen as inconsiderate. Some might argue that the driver's income relies on tips. However, others might empathize with a student's financial situation. The delivery fee is separate, but the tip is part of the service. \n\nThe person says they tip when paying cash, which they do by giving change. But when paying with card, maybe they didn't add a tip. In the US, when paying by card, it's common to add a tip manually. If they didn't add any, that's not tipping. But maybe they were just following their own country's habit. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether US norms require tipping even if it's a small amount. If the person can't tip 15-20%, maybe even a small tip is better. But if they didn't tip at all, that might be considered wrong. The total being $19 for ramen might be a stretch, but the delivery fee is part of the business model. The driver's pay is likely based on tips. \n\nI think in the US context, not tipping is seen as wrong, regardless of personal financial situation. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, there's a nuance if a small tip is possible. But the user didn't mention leaving any tip, even a small one. So they are not tipping at all, which is against the norm. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
