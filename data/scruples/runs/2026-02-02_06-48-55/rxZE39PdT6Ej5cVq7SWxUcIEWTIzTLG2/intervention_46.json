AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high for not much food. They mention in their country they tip 10%, but in the US, tipping practices might be different. They paid with a card and didn't leave a tip, so they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall US tipping customs. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. The standard is usually 15-20%, but sometimes people leave 10% for convenience. However, since the author paid with a card, maybe they don't have to give cash. But in the US, even when using a card, people often add a tip. The delivery fee is separate from the tip, so even if the delivery fee is high, the tip is still expected.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the total seems high. But in the US, not tipping at all could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially since delivery drivers rely on tips. Even though the author might have tight finances, the expectation is that a tip is included for the service. The fact that they mention their country's 10% might mean they're used to a different system, but in the US, 10% is considered low for a tip, and not tipping at all is frowned upon.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't contribute a tip despite the US customs. Even if they paid with a card, the expectation is to include a tip. The high delivery fee doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to tip. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
