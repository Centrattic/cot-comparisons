      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and ends up paying a lot for the delivery fee. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but when paying with card, they don't tip because they don't get change. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even if you pay by card. The standard is usually around 15-20%, though some might go lower. The author might be under the impression that tipping is only necessary when paying with cash, which isn't the case here. \n\nThe author is a student struggling financially, which is a common situation. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for not tipping. Even if they can't afford much, some amount is better than nothing. The delivery fee is part of the total cost, so the author should include a tip regardless of the payment method. \n\nIn their country, tipping 10% when paying with cash is standard, but in the US, the expectation is higher. Since they're using a card, the tip can be added during the payment process. Not leaving any tip when the norm is to leave a percentage might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, even though they might have financial constraints. The right approach would be to leave a small tip if possible, even if it's a lower percentage. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
