      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is at fault. The scenario is that they're a student with limited money, they don't order food often, and when they do, they pay with a card without tipping. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but in the US, they might not know the usual tipping practices. They also point out the total cost including delivery, which they find high for the meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping delivery drivers is common, typically around 15-20%, especially if the order is more than a few items. However, if the delivery fee is included in the total, sometimes people might not tip if they feel the fee covers the driver's pay. But the user paid with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip automatically. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they can't afford to tip because of the high total cost. But they're comparing to their home country's 10% standard. However, in the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as a significant part of their income, especially since their base pay might be low. Not tipping could affect their earnings. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a financial situation where they're stretched. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they should avoid ordering food until they can. But is it wrong to not tip if they can't afford it? Maybe not, but it's a cultural expectation in the US that differs from their home country. \n\nThe key points are cultural differences in tipping norms and financial constraints. The user isn't maliciously skipping the tip; they're just not aware or can't afford it. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a cultural expectation, but they're a student with limited funds. The answer might be no, but there's a nuance. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and considering US norms where tipping is expected, maybe they are at fault. But considering their situation, maybe not. Hmm. I think the answer could be B (No) because they're not intentionally being stingy, just in a different cultural context and financial situation. But others might argue that in the US, you should tip regardless. I need to check if the act of not tipping is wrong here. If the user is unaware of the US norms, it's a mistake but not necessarily their fault. So B.\n"
