When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they usually make their own food, and when they do order, they pay with a card. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but in the US, they might not be sure. They paid $19 for ramen, which they think is a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, for delivery, it's common to tip around 15-20%, especially if you pay with a card. However, sometimes people might tip less if they feel the service was minimal. But the key here is the person's financial situation. They're a student, so maybe they can't afford to tip as much. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The person is upset about the total cost, which includes the delivery fee. They might not be aware that tipping is expected even with card payments. In some cases, apps might have a built-in tip option, but the user might not be using that. \n\nThe question is whether not tipping is wrong. In the US, not tipping at all could be seen as rude, but if the person is struggling financially, others might understand. However, there's also the argument that delivery workers rely on tips. So, it's a balance between personal financial constraints and social expectations. \n\nThe answer might depend on the context. If the person is able to tip even a small amount, maybe 5-10%, but chooses not to, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they can't afford any tip at all, then it's more understandable. The user paid with a card, so maybe they could have added a tip through the app. If they didn't, they might be in the wrong, but if they couldn't afford it, maybe not. The $19 total might be considered a bit high, but if that's the cost including delivery, maybe the tip is still expected. \n\nSo, the answer could go either way. But since the user is a student with limited funds, and the cost is already high for them, others might be more lenient. However, the general expectation in the US is to tip for delivery. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong), but some might say B. Need to decide based on the info given.\n"
