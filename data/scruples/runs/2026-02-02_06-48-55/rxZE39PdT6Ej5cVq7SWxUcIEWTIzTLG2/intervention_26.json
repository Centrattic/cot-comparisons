      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy in the US. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery to be high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, wondering if that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I remember that tipping practices differ between countries. The author is from a place where 10% is standard, but in the US, tipping is more customary and often expected, especially for service workers like delivery drivers. In the US, it's common to tip around 15-20%, sometimes even more for good service. Also, delivery drivers might rely on tips for a significant portion of their income, as their base pay might be low.\n\nThe author's argument is that they don't have much money and the total cost is high. However, in the US, even when paying with a card, it's customary to add a tip, sometimes through the app or by requesting additional payment. The delivery fee is separate from the tip. So even if the delivery fee is high, the tip is for the driver's time and effort in delivering the food. \n\nThe author is paying with a card, so maybe they didn't have the opportunity to leave cash tips like they do in their home country. In some apps, you can specify the tip amount, but it's still expected to leave something. Not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the driver is relying on those tips. \n\nThe cost of $19 for ramen might seem high, but the tip is part of the service. Even if the author is tight on money, leaving a small tip, like $2 or $3, which is common for delivery, would be expected. So, in the US context, not tipping at all could be considered wrong because it's part of the culture and expectations for service workers.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the local tipping norms, even though they might have done so in their home country. The answer should be A.\n"
