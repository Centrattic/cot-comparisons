      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the delivery fees high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, since in their country it's 10% when paying cash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the US tipping culture. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, usually around 15-20%. However, the user isn't familiar with this and comes from a country where 10% is standard when paying cash. They also use a card, which might make it easier to forget or not add a tip, especially if the system doesn't prompt for it.\n\nThe delivery fee is separate from the tip, but the user feels the total cost is high. They might be confused about whether tipping is expected even when paying with a card. Some platforms automatically add a tip option, but maybe this one didn't, leading them to overlook it.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the cost is already high. But in the US, tipping is considered part of the service cost, not just a bonus. So even though they're using a card, the expectation is still there. However, their lack of knowledge about US norms and financial constraints could be a factor. \n\nBut the key point is whether they're in the wrong. If they didn't tip because they didn't know the custom, maybe they're less at fault. However, if they had the means to tip a small amount (like 10%), even with a card, then not tipping could be seen as wrong. Since the user is a student with limited funds, maybe it's more understandable, but the expectation in the US is higher. So the answer might depend on balancing cultural differences and local norms.\n"
