      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, usually make their own food, and sometimes order when they feel like it. The delivery place charges a fee, so they end up paying a lot for not much food. They mention that in their country, it's 10% when paying with cash, but they use a card and don't tip. The total came to $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery services, even though it's not always mandatory. The person might not be aware of the local norms. Since they're paying with a card, maybe the tip isn't automatically added. But the question is whether not tipping makes them at fault.\n\nThey argue they don't have a lot of money. But even if they can't tip 10%, maybe a small tip is expected. However, the total is $19 for ramen, which seems high. Maybe the delivery fee is expensive, which could be the issue here. If the delivery fee is part of the price, then the person might feel they're already paying more than they should, so not tipping because of that might be understandable. \n\nBut in the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. So not tipping could be seen as unfair. However, if the customer feels they're being overcharged already, there's a balance. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong if they can't afford to tip, but it's a common expectation. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the user is in the wrong for not tipping. If the user is a student with limited funds and can't afford to tip, maybe B (not in the wrong). But if they had the means and just chose not to, maybe A. But given the context of being a student and the high cost, maybe B is the right answer. The person is not in the wrong for not tipping under those circumstances.\n"
