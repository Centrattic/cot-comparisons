      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, and in their country, the usual tip is 10%. They feel it's absurd to pay $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even though in their country it's 10%, maybe in the US it's expected to tip even when paying by card. The question is whether the author is wrong for not tipping.\n\nThe author is a student with financial constraints. They might not have the means to tip, but in the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. So not tipping could impact the driver's earnings. However, the user might be unaware of local customs. The total cost including delivery is a factor too. The user finds it expensive, but maybe they should still tip regardless of the total.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit of a gray area. If the user is following their country's norm but in the US, they might be in the wrong. However, if they're a student with limited funds and can't afford to tip, maybe it's understandable. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on the expectation in the US versus their own country's practices. Since they paid with a card, maybe they didn't have the option to tip automatically, but they still had the choice. So, perhaps the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is expected, even if you pay by card.\n"
