      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention paying with a card instead of cash, so they didn't give a tip because in their country, it's 10% when paying cash.\n\nFirst, cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for service jobs like delivery, often around 15-20%, whereas in their home country it's 10%. The author is in the US, so local norms apply. Even though they're paying with a card, the expectation in the US is that tips are added, either via card or cash. So the author might not have followed the local expectation.\n\nBut the author is a student with limited funds and finds the cost high. They might feel it's unfair to tip on top of the delivery fee. However, the delivery guy's income likely relies on tips. The question is whether not tipping is wrong here. \n\nArguments for being in the wrong: Not tipping violates US norms, especially when using a card, which often allows adding a tip. The delivery driver depends on tips as part of their pay. The author is aware of the US tipping culture because they mentioned it in the question.\n\nArguments against: They are in a financial situation where every dollar counts. The total cost seems high to them, and they might not see it as their responsibility to pay extra. They followed their home country's practice, which might not align with US customs.\n\nBut the key point is the location. Since the question is set in the US, local customs are expected. Even if the author is used to a different system, adapting to local practices is part of being a customer there. So, not tipping when it's expected would be considered wrong, hence AITA (Am I the Asshole) is leaning towards the author being the asshole. However, the financial hardship is a mitigating factor. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the norms are strict. In the US, not tipping is considered rude and unethical, regardless of financial status. So, even if they can't afford it, they should still tip if they can. If they can't, maybe a smaller amount, but 0% is generally unacceptable. \n\nThe delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author is upset about the delivery fee but the tip is for the service. So, not tipping is a separate issue. \n\nGiven all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip when it's expected in the US, even though they have a valid reason for financial strain. The local norms take precedence.\n"
