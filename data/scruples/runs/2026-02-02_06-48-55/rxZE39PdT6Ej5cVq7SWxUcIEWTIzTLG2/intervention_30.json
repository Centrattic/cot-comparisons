AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and is frustrated because the total cost, including delivery, feels high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but they're in the US now where maybe tipping is expected more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, especially when paying with a card. The author is paying with a card, so they don't have to give cash, which might make them less likely to tip. The total cost they mention is $19 for ramen, which seems steep, contributing to their reluctance.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're a student with limited funds, ordering infrequently. They might not see the delivery fee as separate from the total, so adding a tip could feel like double-charging. However, in many US contexts, tips are considered part of the service cost, not just the food price.\n\nBut then again, the delivery fee might already cover the driver's base pay, and the tip is for the service. If the author didn't tip, the driver might not get as much as expected. However, the author might not know this and is just reacting to the high total cost. Also, since they're from a country where 10% is standard, maybe they're not aware of US expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in the US context, not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair, especially since the driver's income often relies on tips. However, the author's financial situation and lack of awareness might mitigate that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nSo, in the US, tipping is expected even for delivery. The author not tipping could be considered in the wrong because they didn't account for the customary practice. Even if the total seems high, the tip is separate. The author's reasoning about their country's norms might not apply here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
