      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is at fault. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, usually cook their own food, and when they do order delivery, they pay with a card and don't tip. They mention the total came to $19 for ramen, which seems high because of the delivery fee. They also note that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip with the change. Now, in the US, tipping is usually expected for delivery, often around 15-20%, right? So here's the thing: the author is using a card, which might make it easier to not tip since they don't have cash on hand. But is that a valid excuse?\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Tipping for delivery is common, even if it's sometimes optional. The delivery fee might cover part of the driver's pay, but the tip is still a significant part of their income. If the user is in the US, they might be expected to tip, regardless of the payment method. However, the user is from another country where tipping is 10%, so maybe they're not aware of the US tipping culture. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nThe argument for them being in the wrong is that they have the means to tip, even if they're on a budget. They could argue that they can't afford it, but others in similar situations might still choose to tip. On the other hand, if the total is $19 and the delivery fee is high, maybe the tip is already included in the total. Wait, no, delivery fees and tips are usually separate. So the user might not realize that the tip is a separate charge that's part of the delivery cost. \n\nBut in the US, even if you pay with a card, you can add a tip. So the user could have added a tip through the app or website when paying with a card. The fact that they didn't do that might be considered inconsiderate. Also, the user mentions they \"barely order food,\" so maybe they don't do it often enough to understand the local customs. But that's not an excuse. They could have researched or asked about tipping norms. \n\nAnother angle: the user's perspective is that they're a student with limited funds. If they can't afford to tip, maybe it's understandable. However, in the US, tips are expected as part of the service cost. So even if they're on a budget, they might be expected to adjust their spending to include a tip. The user might not have considered that the delivery driver relies on tips for their income. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: the user is in a different country with different tipping norms, but they're in the US now. They have the financial means to tip if they prioritize it, even if it's a small amount. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not tipping, as it's a cultural expectation in the US. But if tipping isn't mandatory and the user didn't know, maybe they're not. However, the consensus here leans towards AITA for not tipping, so the answer is A.\n"
