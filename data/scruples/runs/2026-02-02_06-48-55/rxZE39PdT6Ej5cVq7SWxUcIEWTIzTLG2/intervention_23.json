AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy in the US. The author is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally, and mentions that in their country, a 10% tip is standard. They paid with a card and didn't leave a tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, especially delivery drivers. The standard is usually around 15-20%, especially for delivery where the driver might carry the food up stairs or wait for a long time. However, the author is coming from a different cultural background where 10% is standard. But since they're in the US, they might be expected to follow local customs.\n\nThe argument for the author being in the wrong is that they didn't tip at all, which is below the US norm. Even if the total was high, not tipping could be seen as unfair to the delivery worker who relies on tips as part of their income. The high price they paid (like $19 for ramen) includes the delivery fee, but that doesn't negate the expectation of a tip.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a student with limited means. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they should avoid ordering or budget accordingly. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Even if they can't afford a big tip, not tipping at all might still be considered wrong. However, some might argue that if they can't afford to tip, they aren't responsible for the tip if they paid by card. But in practice, many people do add tips when paying by card to cover the service.\n\nSo, considering the US norm where tipping is expected and the author didn't tip, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But there's also a nuance in their financial situation. However, the expectation in the US is strong enough that not tipping is generally frowned upon, regardless of the payment method. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
