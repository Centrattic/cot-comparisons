      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally but finds the total cost (including delivery and tip) too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but when using a card, they don't tip because they don't get change to round up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus the author's country. In the US, tipping is a significant part of service workers' income, especially for delivery drivers. The standard tip for delivery is often around 15-20%, or at least 10%, even when paying by card. However, the author is used to a system where tipping with cash is easier because you can round up with change. When paying by card, maybe they aren't as accustomed to adding a tip digitally.\n\nThe author is a student and mentions being tight on money. The cost of the meal plus delivery and tip adds up to $19 for ramen, which seems high. But in the US, delivery fees can be steep, and tips are expected. The author might not realize that not tipping when using a card is seen as rude or unfair in the US context. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're following their own country's habits and are being honest about their financial situation. But in the US, expectations around tipping differ, and not tipping, regardless of payment method, could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nI need to weigh the cultural difference versus the local norm. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely lean towards \"Yes\" (A) because in the US context, not tipping when using a card is expected to be included in the payment process. The author's justification is based on their country's practice, but they're operating in the US now, so adhering to local norms is important. However, if the author is a tourist or just doesn't know the US tipping culture, it might be seen as a misunderstanding. But given the structure of the question, it's probably assuming the US context. So the answer is A.\n"
