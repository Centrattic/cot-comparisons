      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays with a card. They mention that the total came to $19 for ramen, which includes a delivery fee. They\u2019re wondering if not tipping is wrong. In their country, they tip 10%, but they\u2019re used to tipping when paying cash. Since they use a card here, they didn\u2019t leave a tip. \n\nNow, the key points here. In the US, tipping is customary, even for delivery. Unlike some countries where service charge is included or tipping isn\u2019t expected, US delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. The author isn't paying cash, so maybe they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to round up the tip, but online platforms usually allow adding a tip when paying by card. The total was $19, which is pretty low, but even a small tip percentage would be a few dollars. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don\u2019t have a lot of money, but they\u2019re still choosing to order food. If they can afford the meal, they can afford a small tip. Also, the delivery fee might be part of the driver's compensation, but in reality, delivery drivers are often paid a base rate plus tips. So not tipping could mean they\u2019re underpaying the driver. \n\nHowever, the user is in a country where tipping is 10%, but in the US, the expectation is usually 15-20% for good service. The author is used to cash tips, but when paying by card, maybe they didn\u2019t know how to add a tip. Some apps allow you to add a tip at checkout. If they didn\u2019t do that, then they might have been in the wrong because the driver expects it. \n\nBut the total is only $19. Maybe a 10% tip would be $1.90, which isn't much. The author could have added that even if they're tight on money. The fact that they order infrequently doesn\u2019t mean they can skip tipping. The question is whether it's wrong to not tip when using a card. If the platform allows adding a tip, then not doing so is considered wrong. If they didn\u2019t have a chance, maybe not, but generally, online orders include tip options. \n\nSo the answer would be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because they had the means to tip even if small, especially since they\u2019re paying by card which usually includes a tip option. The driver relies on tips, so not tipping is seen as inconsiderate and unfair.\n"
