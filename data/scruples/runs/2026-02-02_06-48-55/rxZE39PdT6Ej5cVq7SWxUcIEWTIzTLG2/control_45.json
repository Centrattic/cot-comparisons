      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a student with limited money. They usually make their own food but sometimes order takeout. The place they order from has a delivery fee, and they end up paying a lot for not much food. The total came out to $19 for ramen. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, so they might be used to tipping that way when paying cash by giving change as a tip. But when using a card, maybe they don't add an extra tip because they aren't handling cash. \n\nNow, the question is whether not tipping in this case is wrong. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery, often around 15-20% for good service. However, the key points here are the person's financial situation and the cost of the meal. The total was $19, which is a significant amount for someone who's a student and not ordering food often. If the person can't afford to tip, especially when they're already paying a high price for the meal, it might not be considered wrong. Also, some delivery services might add a tip jar or automatic tip through the app, but the user didn't mention that. Since they're using a card, maybe they aren't in the habit of adding a tip. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on the expectation in the US versus the person's personal circumstances. Since the user is in a different country and might not be used to the US tipping culture, and given their financial constraints, it's possible they're not in the wrong. The delivery fee might already be a part of the cost, and the total price seems high, so expecting an additional tip on top could be unreasonable for them. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
