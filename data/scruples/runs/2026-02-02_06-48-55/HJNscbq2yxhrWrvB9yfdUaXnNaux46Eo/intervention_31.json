He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend's kids are coming to her birthday dinner, but she wants a dinner just for the two of them. She's 21, and she's not into kids. She's mentioned she loves the kids but doesn't want to have them at her birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, she scheduled a dinner at Benihaha, which he and his kids haven't been to. She told him about the dinner and added his kids. Then, she asked again if it could just be the two of them, which he took as inconsiderate and felt she didn't care about his children. He asked for an apology, but she's unsure if she should apologize.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and expectations. She had already added the kids to the dinner but then changed her mind. Even though she mentioned her preference, it's possible that she didn't consider the implications of changing plans after initially including the kids. The boyfriend might feel that she's being inconsistent or not respecting his time with his children, especially since he sees them less often because he's living in a camper. \n\nOn the other hand, she has the right to want a personal time with her partner without the kids. But the way she approached it might have been abrupt. She should have discussed her preferences earlier rather than changing the plans last minute. Also, since she had already included the kids, changing that decision might have caused confusion or hurt feelings. The fact that he felt it was a rethinking of their relationship suggests that the communication was not handled well. \n\nSo, maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't consider the emotional impact of changing the plans after including the kids. Even if her intention was to have a two-person dinner, she should have communicated her preference upfront and respected the initial inclusion of the kids. Alternatively, if she didn't want the kids there, maybe she shouldn't have added them in the first place. \n\nBut others might argue that she has the right to her own space and that asking once is reasonable. However, given the sensitivity around co-parenting and the boyfriend's situation with limited time with his kids, her request might have been seen as dismissive of his priorities. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her being in the wrong because she didn't anticipate the emotional response and changed plans after including the kids. She should have communicated her desire for a two-person dinner earlier to avoid the conflict. So, Answer A.\n"
