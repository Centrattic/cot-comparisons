He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a person (the author) who asked her boyfriend not to bring his kids to a birthday dinner, and he took it as a personal offense, feeling she doesn't care about his children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 21, in a 2-year relationship with a boyfriend who has two kids. The boyfriend moved into a camper, so he sees his kids twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want any of her own. The birthday dinner was scheduled as a date night, but she asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend felt she was trying to get him to abandon the kids, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I should analyze both sides. The author's intention was to have a date night, which is reasonable. She had mentioned the dinner before and added the kids, but then asked again. The boyfriend felt hurt, interpreting the request as not valuing his children. The question is whether her request was inconsiderate.\n\nKey factors: communication style, understanding of the boyfriend's perspective, and whether the request was reasonable. The author might have known that the boyfriend sees his kids less often now due to moving into a camper. Asking for a parent-child-free date night isn't inherently wrong, but the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling that the author doesn't support his parenting, which is a valid concern if there's a history of tension around the kids. However, the author's request was straightforward and she didn't have ill intent. The boyfriend's response might be overreacting, but his feelings are valid too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's request for a date night is understandable, but she might not have considered how it would make her boyfriend feel, especially given his situation. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but his feelings are real. The author's response of being defensive and not apologizing could be seen as not acknowledging his feelings. However, the initial request itself might not be wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that there's room for better communication.\n"
