He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not wanting to bring his kids to a birthday dinner. The author is 21, in a 2-year relationship, and the boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage. The boyfriend moved into a camper, so he sees the kids less often. The author had planned a dinner for just the two of them, but the boyfriend thought the kids should come. When she asked again to confirm it's just the two of them, he felt she didn't care about his kids and wanted her to apologize.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author had already told the boyfriend about the dinner and added the kids, but then asked again if it could be just them. The boyfriend feels hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids. The author says there was no ill intent, just wanting a parent-free dinner. The boyfriend's reaction is that she's being inconsiderate and wants her to apologize.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had prior knowledge about the kids' situation and had included them initially. But maybe she didn't realize how important it is for the boyfriend to involve his kids, especially since he's living in a camper and sees them less. The boyfriend might feel that the author is dismissing his parental responsibilities. On the other hand, the author is within her rights to want a private dinner on her birthday. The question is whether her request was unreasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if asking for a dinner without the kids is unreasonable given the context. The boyfriend's reaction is strong, but if the author had communicated better from the start, maybe the situation could have been avoided. She added the kids initially but then changed her mind later. Maybe the boyfriend felt it was a commitment he made, and changing it last minute hurt him.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about respecting others' feelings and communication. If the author had a conversation earlier about her preference for a parent-free dinner, maybe it would have been handled differently. Since she asked again close to the event, it might have come off as last-minute. The boyfriend might feel he can't control the situation, especially if the kids are his responsibility. The author's lack of apology and the fact that others told her not to apologize might indicate that the community sees her position as valid. But the boyfriend's feelings are important too. \n\nI think it's a nuanced case. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she has the right to want a private dinner. However, she might not have considered the emotional impact on her boyfriend and his relationship with his kids. The way she handled the request, perhaps not being clear from the start, could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be that she's not the asshole, but she could have approached it differently. However, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. But according to AITA standards, if both sides have valid points, the answer might lean towards not the asshole. Let me check the response options again. Answer A is yes (author is wrong), B is no. Based on the analysis, the author isn't in the wrong, so B.\n"
