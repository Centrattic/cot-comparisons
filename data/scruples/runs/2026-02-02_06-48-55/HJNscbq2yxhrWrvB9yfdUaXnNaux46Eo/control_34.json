He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner. The boyfriend moved out and sees his kids less now. She loves the kids but doesn't want them at her birthday dinner. He felt she was being inconsiderate and that she doesn't care about his kids.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author wants a private dinner with her boyfriend for her birthday. She had previously arranged the dinner for just them, but then he added the kids. She asked again if it could be just them. He took it as her not caring about his kids. She doesn't think she's wrong and others said not to apologize.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author made a specific request for a private dinner. She had already set it up as a romantic dinner. It's reasonable for her to want some alone time with her partner on her birthday, especially since she's 21. The boyfriend might feel that his kids are a priority, especially since he has less time with them now. However, the author had communicated her preference clearly. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh\u2014accusing her of wanting him to abandon the kids is a big leap. Maybe he felt his parental duties were being challenged.\n\nBut the author did ask again, which might have come off as dismissive of his parental responsibilities. Even if she meant well, not considering the emotional impact on him could be a mistake. However, she did mention she loves his kids and spends time with them. The main conflict is between her desire for a private celebration and his need to spend time with his children. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's request was clear, but she might have underestimated how it would affect her partner. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was over the top. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting a private dinner, especially if it's already planned. The boyfriend needs to balance his kids' needs with his partner's wishes. Since the author's intention was to have a romantic dinner, and she communicated that, she isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but his response seems disproportionate. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
