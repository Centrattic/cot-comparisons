He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 21, wants to have a birthday dinner with just her boyfriend. He has two kids from a previous marriage, and they're living in a camper now, which might mean he sees them less. He invited his kids to the birthday dinner, but the author asked if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend got upset, feeling she doesn't care about his kids and wants him to abandon them. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to want a one-on-one dinner for her birthday. She's been with him for two years and has interacted with the kids before. She even mentioned not drinking the weekend of the party because of the kids being there. She asked once again if it could be just them. But maybe the way she asked wasn't clear enough about her intentions. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel that his kids are part of his life and he can't just exclude them without some consequence. He might feel that the author is trying to push his kids out, even if that's not the case. The fact that he moved into a camper and sees the kids less might add to his stress, making him more sensitive about their time together.\n\nThe key points here are communication and sensitivity. The author had mentioned the dinner and added the kids, then later asked again if it could be just them. The boyfriend might have felt blindsided or that the request came too late. It's possible that the author didn't consider how important this time with his kids is, especially since he's already seeing them less. Even though she doesn't want kids herself, showing understanding of his parental responsibilities might be important here.\n\nThe author might be in the right in wanting a quiet dinner for her birthday, but she might have been inconsiderate of the boyfriend's feelings and the practical aspects of his situation with his children. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels his family time is being dismissed. The author could have handled it better by discussing expectations earlier or showing more empathy towards his situation. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room to consider his perspective more. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, and based on the information given, it's possible she's not the asshole since she had her own wishes and the boyfriend overreacted. But I'm a bit conflicted here. The answer might depend on cultural norms or societal expectations about relationships and blended families.\n"
