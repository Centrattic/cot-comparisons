He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner for her birthday. The boyfriend got upset, thinking she doesn't care about the kids or wants him to abandon them. \n\nFirst, the author had previously scheduled a dinner for just her and her boyfriend at Benihaha. She mentioned that the kids aren't going to be there. She had already considered adding the kids but didn't. Then, she asked again to make sure it was just the two of them. The boyfriend took it as being inconsiderate.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend wanted a special one-on-one dinner for her birthday. The boyfriend felt that she's not being supportive of his parental role. But she does mention that she loves the kids and spends time with them. So why does the boyfriend feel hurt?\n\nMaybe the issue is about how the request was made or the context. If she had been consistently involved with the kids and suddenly cutting them out for a dinner might make the boyfriend feel like she's choosing her desires over his responsibilities. However, the girlfriend's request seems reasonable because it's her birthday, and she wants a special meal without the kids. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he might feel that she's not respecting his time with his children, especially since he's seeing them less due to living in a camper. The fact that she didn't see the harm in asking again might have come off as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nWait, but the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's reasoning is that she wanted a special dinner for her birthday and didn't see a problem in asking. However, the boyfriend felt hurt and accused her of not caring. The user mentions that people told her not to apologize, but the boyfriend is rethinking their relationship because of this.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe she should have considered her boyfriend's perspective more. Even if she meant it as a simple request, not bringing up the kids might be a sensitive topic for him. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong because she's expressing her own needs, but she might need to consider his feelings more. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider the emotional impact of her request. Even if it's her birthday, maybe there's a way to accommodate both her desire for a special dinner and his need to spend time with the kids. But she's not the one who set up the dinner; she scheduled it for just the two of them. So maybe she's not in the wrong here because it's her birthday and she has a right to want a special celebration. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her request was reasonable and if she considered his feelings. She did mention she loves the kids but doesn't want them here. However, the boyfriend's feelings are hurt because he perceives her as not supporting his parental time. The author might not be in the wrong because it's her birthday and she's expressing her preferences, but there's room for better communication. Since the question is whether she's the asshole, people might have different views. The answer is likely B (No), but there's nuance. The user's question asks if she's in the wrong. The answer is B because she's not in the wrong, but there's room for discussion. But maybe A because she didn't consider his feelings enough. Hmm.\n"
