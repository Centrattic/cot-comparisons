He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a woman in a two-year relationship with a man who has two kids, asked him not to bring his children to a planned birthday dinner. The man felt hurt and accused her of not caring about his kids and possibly trying to get him to abandon them. The author is confused and doesn't think she's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author had a one-on-one dinner planned for her birthday, which she scheduled with the intention of it being just her and her boyfriend. She had already mentioned the kids would be coming over on the weekend for her birthday party but wanted this dinner to be special and alcohol-free. She asked him again if they could just have dinner without the kids. The boyfriend took offense, feeling she didn't care about his kids, even though she mentions she does care and interacts with them.\n\nThe author's reasoning: She wants a special evening with her boyfriend, which is understandable. She had planned it as a two-person dinner. However, she had already scheduled the kids' inclusion in the weekend's plans. The boyfriend, who's seeing his kids less due to living in a camper, might feel that this dinner is the only time he can see them. The author's request might come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The main issue is communication and sensitivity. While her desire for a private dinner is valid, the way she approached it might not have considered the boyfriend's feelings and circumstances. He might see the dinner as a chance to spend time with his kids, especially since he's living in a camper and has less frequent contact. The fact that she had to ask twice could imply she wasn't clear initially or didn't consider the implication of not including the kids. Even if she didn't mean to, her request might have made the boyfriend feel like his parental responsibilities are being ignored, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is strong, but the author's intent was to have a special evening. However, not acknowledging the boyfriend's need to spend time with his children, especially given his living situation, might mean she didn't consider his perspective enough. The fact that she didn't apologize and is confused suggests a possible lack of understanding of how her request affected him.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal desires with the partner's needs. While the author's desire isn't unreasonable, the way it was handled might not have been the best approach. She should have discussed the dinner in a way that considered the boyfriend's responsibilities to his children. Even if she didn't mean to, her request might have been inconsiderate of his situation. So, I think the author is partially at fault for not being fully considerate of the boyfriend's feelings and circumstances. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
