He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner on her birthday. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage. They live in a camper now, so he sees them less often, but it's still twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want to have children herself. She's planning a birthday dinner for herself and her boyfriend at a nice restaurant. She initially added the kids to the reservation, thinking it was okay, but then changed her mind and asked if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend took it as a personal slight, feeling she doesn't care about his kids and is trying to get him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, and she's confused because friends say she doesn't need to apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and expectations. The author made a dinner reservation and later changed the plan. But the boyfriend's reaction is quite strong. The question is whether her request was wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, respecting each other's needs is important. The author wanted a private dinner for her birthday, which is a reasonable request. However, since the kids are part of the boyfriend's life and he sees them less due to his living situation, not including them might seem inconsiderate. The problem might be that the author didn't consider the emotional impact on her boyfriend. Even if her intention was to have a private dinner, she should have framed it in a way that acknowledges his responsibility and feelings towards his children. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Feeling that she wants him to abandon his kids is a big leap. Maybe he's overreacting, but the author's approach could have been more sensitive. The initial reservation including the kids might have been a mistake since she later changed it. If she wanted to exclude the kids, she should have discussed it earlier, not just at the last minute. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting a private dinner, but her communication could have been better. However, the boyfriend's response is also overly harsh. The answer depends on whether the author's request was reasonable given the context. Since the kids are part of his life and he's already seeing them less, the author might be in a bit of a gray area. But she's not entirely wrong. The friends' advice might be correct because she's within her right to want a personal birthday dinner. The main issue is the way she communicated it and the boyfriend's interpretation.\n"
