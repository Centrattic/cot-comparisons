He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 21-year-old woman who's been dating her boyfriend for almost two years. He has two kids from a previous marriage, 9 and 11 years old. The boyfriend moved into a camper, which means he sees his kids less, but still twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want to have kids herself. She had planned a dinner for just her and her boyfriend at Benihana, a place they haven't been to. She told him about the dinner and mentioned that he should add his kids. Then, right before the event, she asked again if it could just be the two of them for her birthday. He felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids and wants him to abandon them, leading him to question their relationship and ask for an apology. She's confused if she should apologize.\n\nFirst, let's consider the user's perspective. She wanted a special dinner just for her and her boyfriend on her 21st birthday. It's her birthday, so she might feel entitled to have it her way. She had already planned the dinner but then double-checked if it could be just them. She might not have realized how that request would affect her boyfriend's feelings. She mentioned she loves the kids, so she's not against spending time with them, but maybe she wanted some alone time with her partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is significant. He feels that she's being inconsiderate and doesn't care about his children. He lives in a situation where he's already seeing his kids less because of the camper, so any time he gets with them might be precious. If she asked him to exclude the kids at the last minute, he might feel like she's not respecting his parenting responsibilities or the time he's already managing with them. His reaction of needing an apology and considering the relationship might be overreaction, but his feelings are valid in that he feels hurt.\n\nThe key points here are communication and understanding. The woman might not have considered how her request would impact her boyfriend's feelings about his relationship with his children. Even though she had mentioned the kids before, asking again to exclude them might have come off as dismissive of their importance in his life. She had scheduled the dinner with the kids in mind, then changed her mind, which could be seen as inconsistent. However, she did ask politely and might not have intended to hurt him. Still, her lack of consideration for his perspective and the potential effect on his parenting duties could be problematic.\n\nOthers advised her not to apologize, but that might be because they see her request as reasonable. However, in relationships, it's also about considering each other's feelings and circumstances. Her boyfriend's kids are part of his life, and he might feel that including them is important. If she had planned the dinner with the intention of it being just the two of them but didn't communicate that clearly from the start, that could be an issue. Alternatively, if she realized after scheduling that she wanted alone time, maybe she should have discussed it earlier to manage expectations.\n\nAnother angle is that she's 21, and maybe she's still learning about adult relationships. She might not have fully grasped the importance of his parenting role. However, he's 30, and perhaps he should have communicated his expectations better if including the kids was non-negotiable. But since she asked and he felt it was a problem, her request might have crossed a line, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, while the woman's desire for a solo dinner with her partner is understandable, she might be in the wrong for not fully considering how her request would affect her boyfriend's feelings about his children. She had already mentioned including the kids initially, and then changing her mind could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
