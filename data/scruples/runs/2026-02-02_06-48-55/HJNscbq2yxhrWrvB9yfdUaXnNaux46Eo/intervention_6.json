He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner. The boyfriend took it as an insult, feeling that she doesn't care about his children or is trying to push him away from them.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together almost two years. She loves his kids but doesn't want her own. She's planning a birthday dinner for herself, which is a special event (turning 21). She had initially scheduled the dinner but then changed her mind, wanting it to be just them. The boyfriend feels this is inconsiderate because his kids are part of his life, and she's now changing the plans. \n\nShe mentions that the kids are coming to her birthday party, so maybe she feels like she's already spending time with them. However, the boyfriend was under the impression that this dinner was for the kids as well, perhaps because she added them to the reservation. Then she asks again if it can just be them two, which he took as a rejection of his parenting role.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might not have considered how the request could be perceived as dismissing his role as a parent. Even if she loves the kids, asking for a separate time to be just the two of them could be seen as prioritizing her needs without considering his. However, she's also within her right to want quality time with her partner on her birthday. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is strong\u2014feeling she wants him to abandon the kids. That's a heavy accusation. The author might not have realized the emotional weight of her request. The fact that she's 21 and has a right to her own preferences, but in a relationship, balancing each other's needs is important.\n\nIn arguments like this, intentions vs. impact matter. Her intention wasn't to hurt him, but the impact was negative. The question is whether that makes her in the wrong. If she didn't realize the sensitivity around his parenting, maybe she should have communicated differently. However, if she's being reasonable and it's a one-time request, some might say it's not her fault.\n\nLooking at the AITA subreddit dynamics, people often consider context. The boyfriend's reaction might be overblown if the request was reasonable. But if it's a pattern of her wanting to exclude the kids, that's different. In this case, it's a one-time birthday dinner, so maybe not her fault. But the fact that she had to ask again after already adding the kids could be seen as flip-flopping, which could be inconsiderate.\n\nI think the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider how her request could be perceived as disregarding his parental role, even if that wasn't her intention. Relationships require mutual consideration, and in this case, the impact on him was significant. An apology would be appropriate to address the hurt feelings, even if she didn't mean to cause it.\n"
