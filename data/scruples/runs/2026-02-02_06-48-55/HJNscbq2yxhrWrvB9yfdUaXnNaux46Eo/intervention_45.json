He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 21-year-old in a two-year relationship with a boyfriend who has two kids from a previous marriage. The boyfriend recently moved into a camper, which has reduced his time with the kids to twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want children herself. She had planned a dinner for herself and her boyfriend at Benihana, a place he and his kids haven't been. She informed him earlier, adding the kids to the reservation, but then asked again if it could just be the two of them for her birthday. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids and is pushing him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, but she's unsure if she should apologize.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consideration. The author had already made the reservation including the kids but then changed her mind. Even though she had good intentions, the boyfriend might feel that she wasn't consistent in her communication. He has limited time with his kids due to living in a camper, so missing out on a planned dinner might seem significant to him. The author's request could be seen as last-minute and not considering the impact on the kids and his schedule. However, it's also important to consider that the author is focusing on her birthday wishes. But since the boyfriend was already planning to bring the kids, the author's last-minute change might have caused unnecessary hurt. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected towards his children. The author might need to apologize for not considering how her request affects his relationship with his kids. So, the answer might be A.\n"
