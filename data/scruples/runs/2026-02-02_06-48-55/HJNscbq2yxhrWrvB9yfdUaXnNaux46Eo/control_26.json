He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (a woman in a 2-year relationship with a 30-year-old boyfriend) is planning her 21st birthday dinner. The boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage (ages 9 and 11), and he's been living in a camper, which has reduced his time with them. He sees them at least twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want to have any of her own. She's having a birthday dinner with the boyfriend, and she asked if they could just have dinner alone. The boyfriend got upset, feeling she doesn't care about his kids and is trying to get him to abandon them. The author is confused and doesn't think she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend's kids are part of his life, and he's already seeing them less because of his living situation. The author is asking for some alone time, which is understandable. But maybe she didn't consider how the request might make him feel. He might feel that the kids are important and that she's not respecting his role as a father. Even if she loves the kids, not wanting them to be part of the dinner could be seen as a conflict of priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's request is for a personal milestone\u2014her 21st birthday. It's a significant age in many cultures, and wanting to have a dinner just with her partner could be reasonable. She did mention the kids' presence before, so maybe she wasn't trying to exclude them suddenly. But the way it was asked might have come across as dismissive. The boyfriend's reaction seems strong, possibly because he's under stress from his living situation and reduced time with his kids. He might feel that the author is adding to that stress by not valuing the time he can spend with his children.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author's intention was to have a special dinner alone, which is a common request. However, the boyfriend might perceive it as her not valuing his parental responsibilities. The author might not have considered his feelings about balancing his children and their relationship. Even if she has no intention of hurting him, the impact of her request was negative. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's perspectives. The author might have overstepped by not being more sensitive to his situation. Alternatively, the boyfriend's reaction could be overly harsh. The answer depends on whether prioritizing personal time is more important than accommodating a partner's parental needs. \n\nLooking at similar situations, sometimes partners need to make compromises. The author's request isn't unreasonable, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid too. However, the author could have approached the conversation more carefully, perhaps discussing it earlier or finding a compromise. Since the boyfriend felt hurt and accused her of wanting him to abandon the kids, there's a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intentions and harm done. The author's intent was to have a special dinner, but the harm was causing her boyfriend to feel unappreciated and accused of trying to neglect his kids. The author might not be in the wrong if she had a valid reason and communicated it properly, but the way it was handled might have been problematic. \n\nThe fact that the author didn't apologize and others told her not to suggests that maybe she isn't in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. It's a complex situation where both might have valid points. The answer hinges on whether the exclusion of the kids was inconsiderate. Since the boyfriend is already seeing them less, and the author is close to the kids, the request might be seen as reasonable. But the way it was presented might not have been considerate enough. \n\nOverall, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong because her request is reasonable, but she could have handled it better to consider her boyfriend's feelings. However, since the boyfriend felt hurt, there's a gray area. The AITA community often looks at intent versus impact, and if the impact was significant, even if unintended, the person might be considered the asshole. But in this case, the author's intent was clear, and the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the request is reasonable, but she might need to work on communication. However, if the community typically sides with the partner who's being asked to compromise more, it could be A. Need to check similar AITA cases. In many cases, wanting alone time isn't considered wrong, but when it affects the partner's responsibilities, it's tricky. Given the boyfriend's strong reaction and the author's lack of intent, I think the answer is B.\n"
