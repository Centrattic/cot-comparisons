He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their boyfriend's kids to come to a birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage. He's living in a camper now, which makes seeing the kids less frequent. The author loves the kids but doesn't want her own. She had planned a dinner for just her and the boyfriend, expecting them to come with the kids. She then asked if they could have just the two of them for her birthday dinner. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids and is pushing him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, but she's unsure if she should apologize.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author initiated the dinner with the knowledge that the boyfriend would be with his kids that day. She scheduled it under the assumption that he would be with them. Then, when the time approaches, she asks if they can have just the two of them. That might come off as last-minute and possibly not considering the prior arrangement. The boyfriend might feel that she's being inconsiderate because he's already planning to be with his kids, and changing plans at the last minute could disrupt their time, which he values since they're not seeing them as often now.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to have a dinner just for the two of them for her birthday. It's a personal preference, but she might not have communicated this clearly or earlier. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt the request was sudden and hurtful. The key here is communication. The author could have discussed her preference for a child-free dinner earlier, perhaps when making the initial plans, instead of waiting until close to the event. By not doing so, she might have set expectations that included the kids, leading to confusion and hurt feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's feelings are valid because he sees the request as a potential neglect of his parental responsibilities, especially given his current situation. The author, while having her own desires, might not have considered how her request could be perceived as undermining his commitment as a father. Even though the author loves the kids, her last-minute change could be seen as not respecting his priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone else the author asked said not to apologize. That might indicate that others see this as a personal preference. But the crux is the communication timing and sensitivity to the boyfriend's circumstances. The author's lack of apology and the way she phrased the question (asking if she should apologize for a question or hurt feelings) shows she might not see the issue, even if she's not malicious.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent was to have a dinner for two, the way she approached it, especially after already including the kids in the initial planning, could be seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might be in the wrong for not considering how her last-minute request affects him and his relationship with his children.\n"
