He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author asked her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner for her birthday. The boyfriend got upset, thinking she doesn't care about his kids. The author feels she's not in the wrong because she only wanted a dinner with him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has been with her boyfriend for almost two years. He has two kids from a previous marriage. He's living in a camper now, so he sees the kids twice a week. The author loves the kids but doesn't want to have her own. She had planned a dinner at Benihana for just them, but the boyfriend included the kids. She asked again to make it just the two of them. He felt she didn't care about the kids and asked for an apology. She's confused and others said not to apologize.\n\nSo, the main question is whether asking for a dinner without the kids is inconsiderate. The author's intention was to have a special dinner with her boyfriend on her birthday. She had already scheduled it, but maybe didn't check if the kids were part of the reservation correctly. She mentioned adding the kids, but perhaps there was a misunderstanding. However, she had a right to want a romantic dinner. But the boyfriend felt that she's not respecting his relationship with his children. \n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's perspective: he's a single dad, sees the kids less because he's in a camper, and the author is asking him to skip that time. Even though the kids are going to the birthday party, she wants another dinner. He might feel that she's not supportive of his parenting. The author says she loves the kids and has spent time with them, so maybe she didn't realize the emotional impact of asking to leave them out again. \n\nThe author's request might be reasonable for her own desire for a romantic birthday dinner, but the way she approached it might have been insensitive. She had already scheduled the dinner and then asked again, which could make him feel that she's being pushy. Also, since the kids are part of his life, not just his past, the author might need to consider his feelings as a parent. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. He's asking for an apology, which could be a bit harsh, especially if the author's intention was just to have a quiet dinner. But he's under stress from the kids' situation. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author considered the boyfriend's feelings as a parent. Even if she doesn't want kids herself, she needs to respect his relationship with his children. Asking him to bring the kids to a dinner that was initially scheduled for two might be a conflict of expectations. Maybe she should have discussed the dinner in the context of excluding the kids from the start, rather than adding them later. However, she did mention adding them, so maybe she thought that was okay. The problem is that she later changed her mind, which might have been a miscommunication. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction of feeling abandoned and thinking she doesn't care is a strong response. The author's request was for one specific dinner, not a general thing. It's possible that she's in the right because it's her birthday and she deserves a romantic dinner, but she might have mishandled the communication. Alternatively, she's in the wrong for not considering his parenting responsibilities more carefully. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether there's a pattern of behavior. Since this seems like a one-time request and the author has a history of being involved with the kids, maybe she's not the asshole. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid, and she should have considered that. The answer might be a bit nuanced. But given the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. If the majority view is that the author should have considered the boyfriend's role as a parent more, then A. If it's about the boyfriend overreacting, then B. Given the boyfriend's reaction, maybe A is the answer.\n"
