He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend not to bring his kids to their birthday dinner. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage, and they live in a camper now, so he sees them less often. The author mentions they love the kids but don't want their own. They scheduled a dinner for just them and the boyfriend, but he wanted to bring the kids. The author asked again to make it just the two of them, and the boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids. He asked for an apology, but the author is unsure if they should apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They had planned a dinner specifically for their birthday, which is a personal milestone. They might value some alone time with their partner to celebrate without the kids. On the other hand, the boyfriend sees the kids less often now that he's in a camper, so bringing them might be important for maintaining that relationship. The author's request could be seen as prioritizing personal time over the kids' presence, which the boyfriend took as a rejection of his role as a father.\n\nBut the key here is communication. The author had already informed the boyfriend about the dinner and added the kids. Then, they asked again, which might have come off as abrupt or dismissive. Even if the intention was good, the way the request was made could have been hurtful. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he might feel that his children's presence is important, and the author's repeated insistence without considering his feelings could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author argues there was no ill intent, but intent isn't always the main issue. How the request was received matters. The boyfriend felt that the author didn't care about his kids, which could be a legitimate feeling if the request wasn't framed with empathy. The author might not realize the impact of their words on the boyfriend's parental feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend is in a situation where he's already seeing his kids less, so making an effort to include them in the dinner might be his way of maintaining contact. The author's desire for alone time is understandable, but it's a matter of balancing both partners' needs. Since the author didn't consider the emotional weight this request might have on the boyfriend, there's a case to be made that they acted inconsiderately.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the boyfriend overreacted. The author had the right to want some personal time, but the way it was communicated could have been better. The author could have explained their feelings more clearly, showing that they value the kids but wanted a specific time for themselves. The lack of a sincere apology might indicate the author isn't fully acknowledging the boyfriend's feelings, which could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the author's request might have been inconsiderate given the context. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, and the author could have approached the situation with more empathy. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
