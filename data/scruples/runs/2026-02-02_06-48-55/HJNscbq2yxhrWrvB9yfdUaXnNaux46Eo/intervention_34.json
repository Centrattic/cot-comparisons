He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who asked her boyfriend not to bring his kids to her birthday dinner. She had already scheduled a dinner at a nice restaurant, Benihana, which the kids haven't been to. She told him to add the kids, but then later asked if it could just be them two. He felt hurt and accused her of not caring about the kids, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage, and he's seeing them less often because he's living in a camper now. The author loves the kids, helps out with them, but doesn't want to have kids herself. She's planning a 21st birthday dinner where she won't drink because the kids are coming. But she wanted a night just for her and her boyfriend. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When she first told him about the dinner, she mentioned the kids and asked him to add them. Then later, she asked again if it could just be them. Her intention was to have a private dinner, but the way she asked might have come off as dismissive. The boyfriend felt she didn't care about his kids, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nThe author argues she didn't mean any harm, but emotions can run high when family dynamics are involved. The boyfriend's reaction shows he was worried about balancing his relationship and his parental responsibilities. He felt she's pushing for him to abandon the kids, which is a serious accusation. \n\nThe author didn't apologize and instead challenged him, which might have made the situation worse. While she might have had good intentions, the way she handled the request could be seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend's feelings are important here; even if the request was reasonable, the method of communication mattered. \n\nLooking at the responses from others, they said not to apologize, but maybe they didn't consider the emotional impact as much. The author's action could have been a misunderstanding of the boyfriend's priorities. Since the kids are an important part of his life, especially with reduced time due to his living situation, the request to exclude them might not be a simple preference but a boundary that hurt his feelings.\n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The author didn't consider how her request might affect the boyfriend's relationship with his children. Even if she wanted a private dinner, there are ways to approach it without making the other person feel like they have to choose between their partner and their kids. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not acknowledging the boyfriend's perspective and the emotional weight of the request. She should have had a more thoughtful conversation about it, perhaps finding a compromise or understanding his feelings better before making the request. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
