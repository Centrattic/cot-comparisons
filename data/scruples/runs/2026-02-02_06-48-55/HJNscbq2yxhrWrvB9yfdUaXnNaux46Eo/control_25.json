He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to have dinner just with her boyfriend on her birthday instead of including his kids. The boyfriend got upset and felt she didn't care about his kids. \n\nFirst, the author mentions she loves his kids and interacts with them. She's even taken time to do crafts with them. But she wants some alone time with her boyfriend for her birthday. She scheduled a dinner and initially added the kids, then asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend took offense, feeling she's inconsiderate and wants him to abandon the kids.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author might not realize how important it is for her boyfriend to include his kids, especially since he's trying to spend time with them twice a week. Even though she has no kids and doesn't drink because the kids are there, her request for alone time might be seen as a conflict between her personal desire and the boyfriend's parental responsibilities.\n\nBut the author didn't phrase it as a problem with the kids. She just asked if it could be just the two of them. The boyfriend might feel that she's not respecting his need to spend time with his children. The author might not have considered that his time with the kids is limited, and skipping a dinner might affect that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to have a birthday dinner without the kids. It's a personal milestone (turning 21), so she wants special time with her partner. The problem is that she added the kids initially and then changed her mind, which could be confusing. Maybe she should have communicated better from the start. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit intense, but his feelings are valid if he feels she's not supporting his relationship with his children. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to spend time alone, but she might be inconsiderate in not understanding his perspective. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the author had already scheduled the dinner with the kids, changing it might have made the boyfriend feel like she's not consistent. Also, the fact that he's in a camper and sees his kids less often makes his time with them more precious. She should have perhaps discussed this earlier and shown more understanding of his situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings about his limited time with the kids.\n"
