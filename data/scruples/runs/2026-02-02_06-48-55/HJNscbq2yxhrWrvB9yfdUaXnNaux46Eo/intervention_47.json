He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend not to bring his kids to a birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage, and he moved into a camper, which might be affecting his time with them. The author loves his kids but doesn't want to have children herself. They had a scheduled dinner at Benihana for just the two of them, but the boyfriend ended up bringing the kids. The author then asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids or wants him to abandon them. The author is confused and friends told her not to apologize.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's request was inconsiderate. The author had already told him about the dinner and added the kids. Then, she asked again. The boyfriend is upset because he might feel that she's being selfish, especially since he's already making an effort to see his kids given his living situation. On the other hand, the author is celebrating her 21st birthday and wants some alone time with her partner without the kids, which is understandable.\n\nThe author's friends say not to apologize, but the boyfriend is taking it seriously. I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to want some time with her partner without the kids. However, the boyfriend might feel that the kids are important and that she's not respecting his parental responsibilities. The author's repeated request might have come across as dismissive of his situation, especially if he's already limiting his time with the kids. Even though she loves the kids, the way she asked might have been hurtful. The key is whether her request was reasonable and communicated respectfully. If she had a conversation about it earlier and he agreed, then maybe it's his fault for assuming she wanted the kids. But since she asked again, maybe she should have been more considerate of how he might feel. The boyfriend's reaction is strong, but it's his feelings that got hurt. The author might not have intended harm, but she might be in the wrong for not considering his perspective fully. Alternatively, she was within her rights to ask for her own birthday. Hmm. I think it's a bit of a middle ground, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong entirely. However, the way she handled the request could have been more considerate. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she was communicating her desire, but she could have done it more sensitively.\n"
