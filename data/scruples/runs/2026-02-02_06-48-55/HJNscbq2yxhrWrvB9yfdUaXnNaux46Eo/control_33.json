He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's in a two-year relationship with a boyfriend who has two kids from a previous marriage. He moved into a camper, which reduces his time with the kids, but he still sees them twice a week. She loves the kids even though she doesn't want kids herself. For her 21st birthday, she had a dinner planned at a fancy restaurant with her boyfriend, and she asked if it could just be the two of them instead of including the kids. He took offense, saying she doesn't care about his kids and wants him to abandon them. She's confused and doesn't want to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On her side, she planned a dinner and wanted a quiet evening without the kids. She's 21, so maybe she wants a more adult experience. She mentioned she's not drinking because the kids are there. But she had already offered to include the kids, and then changed her mind. However, she didn't see the harm in asking again. On his side, he might feel that she's being inconsistent or not considering his responsibilities as a parent. He might feel that she's not supporting his relationship with his children, especially since he's moving and can see them less often. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She did ask him before, but then later changed her mind. Maybe she should have considered how that might affect his feelings. He might feel that she's being inconsiderate because he's already making an effort to see his kids twice a week despite moving out. If she's already taken the kids out before, maybe he expects her to support his time with them. \n\nBut then again, she's asking for a personal birthday dinner, which is a reasonable request. The problem is that he felt deeply hurt and accused her of not caring. There's a communication breakdown here. She might not have realized how important it is for him to include his kids, even if just for a dinner. However, she's in a relationship and might have the right to some personal time. \n\nThe fact that others told her not to apologize suggests that maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the way she phrased the request could have been better. Instead of asking again after offering to include the kids, maybe she should have communicated her preference earlier. Also, she does love the kids, so her intent wasn't to hurt him. But his feelings are hurt because he might see her request as a lack of support. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If she had considered his feelings and the potential impact on his parenting time, maybe she should have found a middle ground. However, wanting a personal dinner for her birthday isn't unreasonable. The main issue is the communication and sensitivity towards his parental responsibilities. It's possible that both sides need to work on understanding each other's needs better. \n\nIn the end, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but she could have handled the situation more thoughtfully. However, the way the boyfriend reacted seems a bit harsh, as she's not trying to abandon the kids. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. She should probably apologize for the way she handled the request but not for the request itself. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and others said not to apologize, the answer is B.\n"
