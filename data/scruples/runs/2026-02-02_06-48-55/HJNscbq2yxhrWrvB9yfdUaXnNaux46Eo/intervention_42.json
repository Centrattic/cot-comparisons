He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the context again carefully.\n\nThe situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 30-year-old boyfriend who has two children from a previous marriage. The boyfriend lives in a camper now, which means he sees his kids less often, about twice a week. The woman loves the kids and spends time with them when she can. Her birthday is coming up, and she had planned a dinner for just her and her boyfriend at a nice restaurant called Benihaha. She mentioned to him that he and his kids would be coming, so she added them. But then, right before the dinner, she asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend took offense, feeling she didn't care about his kids, was inconsiderate, and that she wanted him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, but she's unsure if she should apologize. The people she asked say not to, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The woman had initially scheduled the dinner with the kids, then changed her mind. She says she didn't mean to hurt his feelings. The boyfriend feels it's disrespectful and that she's trying to push his kids away. The woman is confused because she's being told not to apologize, but she's not sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. Did the woman communicate her preference clearly and respectfully? She did mention the kids initially, then later asked if it could be just the two of them. She might have not considered how that change could affect the boyfriend, especially since he's already in a situation where he sees his kids less than before. The fact that he's living in a camper and sees them twice a week makes the time with his kids more precious. The woman might have made a last-minute change, which could cause stress or feel like she's not respecting his role as a father.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is that he feels she doesn't care about his children. That's a valid emotional response. Even if she loves the kids, the act of changing the plan might be seen as inconsiderate. The woman might not realize the importance of maintaining a consistent presence in his kids' lives, especially given his circumstances. \n\nAnother angle: The woman had scheduled the dinner for her birthday, which is her time to celebrate. But she had already included the kids, then changed her mind. Maybe she should have thought through the implications of her request before making the initial plans. The boyfriend might have made arrangements or felt that inviting the kids was necessary for maintaining his relationship with them. Changing the plans after the fact could be seen as a disruption.\n\nThe woman's reasoning is that she wanted a private dinner for her birthday. That's understandable. However, the way she communicated it might have been abrupt. She might not have considered that the initial plan included the kids, and changing that could be hurtful. The fact that she had to be reminded by the boyfriend's feelings shows a possible lack of empathy in her initial request.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is quite strong. He's asking for an apology and saying it's making him rethink the relationship. That seems a bit harsh, but his feelings are valid. The woman's act of changing the plans without considering the impact might have been inconsiderate. \n\nThe people she asked told her not to apologize. But maybe they're being too lenient. The key here is whether the request was reasonable and communicated appropriately. If she had planned from the start to have a private dinner and only included the kids later, then changed her mind, that's different. But in this case, she had already scheduled it with the kids, then changed her mind. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the kids were expecting to be there.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The woman made a last-minute change to exclude the kids from a dinner that was initially planned with them, which the boyfriend sees as a lack of respect or consideration for his role as a parent. Even though she loves the kids, the action of changing the plans without considering the impact on the boyfriend's relationship with his children could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, she might be in the wrong.\n"
