He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after asking their boyfriend not to bring his kids to a dinner for her birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a 2-year relationship with a boyfriend who has two kids from a previous marriage. The boyfriend moved into a camper, which makes him see the kids less, but he still sees them twice a week. She loves the kids but doesn't want children herself. She had planned a dinner for just them at a fancy restaurant (Benihana?) and asked him if it could just be the two of them for her birthday. He felt she didn't care about his kids, was inconsiderate, and thought she wanted him to abandon them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a specific request for a dinner that was just for them, not the kids. The boyfriend felt hurt and accused her of not caring. She's confused and doesn't know if she should apologize. Others have told her not to, but she's unsure.\n\nI need to determine if her request was inconsiderate. The boyfriend hasn't been there for his kids as much because of living in a camper, so maybe he values the time he does get with them. The author had previously offered to add the kids to the dinner reservation, which she later rescinded. Her initial plan was to have a dinner with just the two of them, but she might have assumed the kids were included, then changed her mind. That could be seen as a flip-flop, which might have hurt his feelings.\n\nBut she also mentions she loves the kids and spends time with them. So her request might be about wanting quality time with her boyfriend for her birthday. However, she had already scheduled the dinner with the kids in mind and then changed it. That could be seen as not considering his needs as a parent. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that he feels she's trying to get him to abandon the kids. She might not have meant that, but her request could be perceived that way. Communication is key here. She asked once again, but maybe she should have considered his feelings about being a parent. Even if she doesn't want kids, respecting his role as a father is important.\n\nOthers have told her not to apologize, but maybe they didn't consider the boyfriend's perspective. The author might have been inconsiderate in changing her plans after already including the kids, without understanding the emotional impact on her partner. So, maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't take into account how important that time with his kids might be, especially since he's missing them due to his living situation.\n\nAlternatively, she's within her rights to want a birthday dinner just for her and her partner. But since he's a parent and the kids are part of his life, perhaps she should have discussed it more carefully. The key is whether her request was reasonable. If the kids were already scheduled to be there, changing the plans at the last minute could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the initial plan allowed for flexibility, maybe she's not wrong.\n\nHmm. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because she's asking for personal time and has made a request. But maybe the way she handled it, changing her mind after the initial plan, could be seen as inconsiderate. But since she asked again and there's no ill intent, maybe she's not in the wrong. I'm a bit torn. The boyfriend's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong if she had a valid reason. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. Since she's in a committed relationship, maybe she should have considered his parental feelings more. But she's also allowed to want time with him. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because she made a request and didn't have ill intent. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean she was wrong.\n"
