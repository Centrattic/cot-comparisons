He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if she's in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend's kids to join their dinner for her 21st birthday. She's been clear that she's okay with seeing the kids normally but wants this specific dinner just for her and her boyfriend. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his kids or wants him to abandon them.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together almost two years. He lives in a camper now, so sees the kids less. She's been involved with the kids, even taking them out. She scheduled dinner at Benihana (a possibly expensive or special place) and initially included the kids but then asked again if it could be just the two. The boyfriend felt this was inconsiderate and accused her of wanting him to abandon the kids.\n\nThe author's perspective is she wanted a special dinner for her birthday and didn't see a problem in asking. The boyfriend felt her request was about the kids and their relationship. The question is whether she's wrong for making this request.\n\nNow, considering communication and expectations. In a relationship, both partners should discuss preferences. The author had previously included the kids in the dinner, but then changed her mind. The boyfriend might have felt that since he's already living apart and seeing the kids less, adding more time with them is necessary, so her request to exclude them was adding to his burden. However, she's also not a parent and doesn't want kids herself. \n\nIs it wrong to want a special evening? Not inherently. But the way it was handled could be the issue. If she had discussed this earlier or found a middle ground, maybe it would have avoided the conflict. However, she did ask once and there was no malice. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, but his perspective is valid because co-parenting situations can be complex. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for wanting a special birthday dinner, but she could have approached the conversation differently. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but his response of rethinking the relationship over a request for a dinner is extreme. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the story is a bit nuanced. The author's actions were a request, not a demand, and she was clear about her intention. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. However, the author didn't consider the potential impact on his co-parenting situation. The key here is whether the request was considerate. Since she had previously included the kids and then changed her mind, without prior discussion, maybe she should have thought more about how it affects him. But she's not wrong for wanting a special night. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the communication. If she had been clear from the start that she wanted the dinner alone, it might have been different. But since she had initially included the kids and then changed her mind, the boyfriend's hurt feelings are understandable. However, he overreacted. The author isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. The majority opinion in such AITA scenarios often leans on whether intentions were bad. The author's intent wasn't malicious, so the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A. However, given the context, I think B is more accurate.\n"
