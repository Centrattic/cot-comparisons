He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to their dinner for her birthday. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage, aged 9 and 11. He's been living in a camper recently, so he sees the kids less often, maybe twice a week. The author loves his kids, even though she doesn't want kids of her own. She's had interactions with them, done crafts, etc. Her 21st birthday is coming up, and she wanted a dinner just with her boyfriend. She mentioned the dinner at Benihana (which I think is a restaurant chain), and she told him the kids should be added. Then, right before the dinner, she asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend took offense, feeling like she doesn't care about his kids, that she's being inconsiderate, and possibly trying to get him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, but she's unsure if she should apologize.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author had already mentioned the dinner to her boyfriend and included the kids. Then she changed her mind last minute, which might have come across as flippant or not considering his feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is based on the fact that he's already seeing his kids less due to living in a camper, so not bringing them might mean even less time with them. He might feel that the author is prioritizing her own wishes over his responsibilities as a father.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that she wanted a special dinner for her birthday, just the two of them. She might not see the issue because she's already interacted with the kids and doesn't want them there for this specific event. However, the way she handled it might have been abrupt or not considerate of his situation. She asked again right before the dinner, which could have made him feel like she wasn't committed to the initial plan or that she's being indecisive.\n\nThe boyfriend's feelings are valid because as a parent, he might feel that his time with his kids is important, especially if it's already limited. The author might not fully grasp the weight of his emotional response. On the other hand, the author's desire for a special, adult-only dinner is also a reasonable request. The problem arises from the communication and the timing of the request. By changing her mind at the last minute, she might have disregarded his plans and the kids' inclusion without considering the implications.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her request was considerate. Since she had already included the kids in the initial plan and then changed her mind without fully addressing his feelings, she might be in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling hurt and undervalued, which is a valid emotional response. The author's insistence on not apologizing suggests she might not see his perspective. The advice that others gave her not to apologize might be because they see her request as reasonable, but the way she handled it could have been a misstep. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between being right and wrong often depends on how actions affect others. The author's request was justified, but the way she communicated it and the timing might have made it seem inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for her to consider his feelings more. However, since the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no), the correct answer here is B, but with the nuance that she could have handled it better. Since the user wants a strict A or B, the answer is B.\n"
