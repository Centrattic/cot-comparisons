He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to bring his kids to her birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has two kids from a previous marriage, and since he moved into a camper, he sees them less often. The author loves the kids and has interacted with them before. Her birthday is coming up, and she wants a quiet dinner with her boyfriend at a nice restaurant. She initially mentioned the dinner and included the kids, but then later asked if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she doesn't care about his children or wants him to abandon them.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author had already scheduled the dinner and told her boyfriend, including the kids. Then she changed her mind and asked again. The boyfriend felt blindsided and taken aback because he might have thought the kids were part of the plan. The author might not have considered how the last-minute change would affect his feelings, especially since he's trying to maintain a relationship with his kids. Even though she loves the kids, her sudden change after including them could be seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because he might feel like his parental responsibilities are being disregarded. The author's confusion about apologizing suggests she might not see the issue, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The answer hinges on whether the author's request was reasonable given the context and how it was communicated.\n"
