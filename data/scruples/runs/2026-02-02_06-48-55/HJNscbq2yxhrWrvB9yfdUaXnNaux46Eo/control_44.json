He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after asking her boyfriend not to bring his kids to a dinner for her 21st birthday. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his kids: he's a 30-year-old with two kids from a previous marriage, ages 9 and 11. He recently moved into a camper, which has reduced his time with them, so he sees them twice a week. The author mentions she loves the kids, even though she doesn't want kids herself. She's done activities with them, so she's not opposed to interacting. \n\nNow, the birthday dinner. The author had planned a dinner at Benihana for just her and the boyfriend. She told him about the dinner, mentioned he would be with his kids that day, and added them in the reservation. Then, closer to the date, she asked again if it could be just the two of them. The boyfriend took offense, feeling she doesn't care about his kids, is being inconsiderate, and that she's trying to get him to abandon them. He asked for an apology, but the author is confused and others have told her not to apologize.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication, expectations, and balance. The author wanted a special dinner for her 21st without the kids. But she had already included the kids in the reservation initially. Then she changed her mind, leading to conflict.\n\nWait, the author says she told him about the dinner, mentioned he would be with his kids that day, and added them. So she was aware he might be with the kids then. But later, she wanted it to be just them. The boyfriend felt hurt because she changed her mind, implying maybe she's not considering his responsibilities as a father. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is asking for a special birthday dinner without the kids. She's 21, so this is a milestone event. It's reasonable to want a night out just with her partner. But she had already made the reservation including the kids, then reversed her decision, which might have confused or upset the boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit strong. Feeling that she doesn't care about his kids is a big jump. It's possible he felt that by changing her mind, she's not respecting his parenting. However, the author had a legitimate reason to want the dinner just for the two of them. The initial inclusion of the kids might have been based on her understanding of his schedule, but then she wanted to adjust it. \n\nBut here's the thing: when she asked again, she didn't consider how it might make him feel. Even though she didn't mean to be inconsiderate, the way she asked (\"if it could just be me and him\") might have come off as dismissive of his role as a father. Especially since he's already seeing them less because he's moving into a camper, and now she's asking to not include them in a social event. \n\nSo, the author might have overstepped by changing the plans last minute without fully considering his feelings. She had already added the kids, then changed her mind. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he might feel that his children are important, and the author's last-minute change could be seen as not considering their importance. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to have a special birthday dinner. It's a valid request. The problem is in the communication and the timing. Maybe she should have discussed the dinner as a two-person event from the start, rather than adding the kids and then removing them later. \n\nIn relationships, especially with step-parent dynamics, clear communication is key. The boyfriend might have felt that the initial inclusion of the kids made him think that the dinner was for all of them, and the sudden change made him feel like his children's presence was being dismissed, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to hurt his feelings, but the act of changing the plans without considering the emotional impact could be seen as inconsiderate. So, while her request is understandable, the way it was handled might have been the issue. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She wanted a personal celebration, which is reasonable. But the way she approached it might have hurt his feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is also a bit harsh, but not entirely unfounded. \n\nGiven that the author had the option to plan a dinner without the kids from the start but instead added them and then changed her mind, it's possible she was inconsiderate. The boyfriend's feelings about his children's presence are valid, and the author should have been more thoughtful in her approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be leaning towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, considering that the boyfriend's reaction seems overly harsh and the author's request is reasonable, maybe she's not in the wrong. Wait, but the fact that she changed her mind after adding the kids and then asked him again could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that the author should have communicated her desire for a two-person dinner from the start. By adding the kids and then changing her mind, she may have created confusion and hurt his feelings. So, she's partially at fault for not being clear initially. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings in the process.\n"
