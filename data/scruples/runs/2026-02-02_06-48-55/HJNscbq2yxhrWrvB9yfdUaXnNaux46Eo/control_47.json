He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend with two kids from a previous marriage. The author wanted a dinner just for the two of them on her birthday, but the boyfriend took offense, thinking she doesn't care about his kids.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been with her boyfriend for almost two years. His kids are 9 and 11, and he sees them at least twice a week, which he moved into a camper, so maybe his access is limited. The author loves the kids but doesn't want kids herself. She's had interactions with them, like crafts and outings. Her birthday is coming up, and she's planning a dinner for just her and her boyfriend. She mentioned the dinner to him and told him to add the kids, but then later asked again if it could just be the two of them. The boyfriend felt hurt, thinking she's pushing him away from the kids. She's confused why she needs to apologize.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is within her rights to want a night alone with her partner. It's reasonable to have personal time, especially a birthday dinner. She's been clear from the start about including the kids but then later asked for a private dinner. Maybe she didn't communicate clearly or consider how it might make him feel. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his parental rights are being undermined, especially since he's the custodial parent and sees the kids less due to moving into a camper. The author might have overstepped by changing the plans after she initially suggested including the kids. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that she scheduled the dinner and told him to add the kids. Then she changed her mind. The problem here is that she set an expectation with the kids included and then later changed it. That could be seen as inconsistent. The boyfriend might have felt she's being inconsiderate because he might have expected the kids to be part of the dinner. Also, the fact that he's a father and sees the kids less often could make him feel that the kids are important in his relationship. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to have a private dinner for her birthday. But maybe she should have handled the request differently. Instead of changing the plans after she already included the kids, she could have discussed it earlier. Also, the way she phrased the question might have come off as dismissive. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he might feel that she's undermining his role as a father. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to include the kids in every outing. \n\nThe key point is communication. If she wanted a private dinner, she should have communicated that from the start instead of changing her mind after the initial plan. But she did mention the dinner and told him to add the kids, then later asked again. That might have caused confusion. The boyfriend's feelings are valid because he might feel that the kids are part of his relationship. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider how her change of plan would affect him and the kids' presence in their relationship dynamics. But others might argue that she's not obligated to include the kids. \n\nLooking at the responses from others, they said not to apologize, but maybe that's because they see her right to have a private dinner. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong, but she could have communicated better. The boyfriend's reaction is harsh, but his feelings are real. So, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because she's not in the wrong for wanting a private dinner. However, if she changed the plans after already including the kids, maybe she's in the wrong. Hmm. I think the key is that she's an adult and has the right to request a private dinner. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top, but maybe she should have considered how it would affect his relationship with the kids. However, she's not obligated to include them in every outing. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
