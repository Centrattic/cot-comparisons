From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her boyfriend about his relationship with his son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend has an 18-year-old son who lives with him. The author thinks the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and spoils the son, like giving excessive attention and doing things like opening an umbrella for him when it rains. The author brings it up, leading to an argument. The question is if she overstepped.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is the father, so his relationship with his adult son is a family matter. However, the author is now involved in a romantic relationship with the father. That might complicate things because she's not a parent figure but is now commenting on how he's raising his child. \n\nThe key points are: Is the author's concern valid? Are her actions justified? Did she approach it in a respectful way? \n\nThe author mentions she tried to be tactful but the boyfriend got defensive. Maybe she should have approached it differently. However, if she feels that the relationship is unhealthy, she might have a right to express her concerns, especially if she's worried about the son's development or the father's well-being. \n\nBut where's the line? Parents can have varying styles, and unless there's actual harm or neglect, it's their choice. The author might not have the authority to judge or intervene unless it's her child or she's a legal guardian, which she's not. She's a partner, so maybe she overstepped by criticizing his parenting. \n\nAlso, her own background with affection might influence her perception. She comes from a less affectionate family, so she finds these gestures creepy. But that's a personal judgment. It's possible that the father's behavior is normal for his family, and the author is projecting her own discomfort.\n\nSo, the author's intervention could be seen as overstepping because she's not part of the parent-child dynamic and is now critiquing his parenting style. The father might feel that his relationship with his son is a private matter. Unless there's abuse or legal issues, she might have no right to interfere. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not respecting his parenting choices and bringing up the issue in a way that caused conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's a partner and living with them, maybe she's part of the family now. But even so, stepping into a parent's decision-making about their child can be problematic. The answer would depend on whether her concerns are valid and how she approached it. Since she tried to be tactful but it still led to an argument, maybe the issue is that she shouldn't have intervened at all. So, the answer might be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
