From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for confronting her boyfriend about his parenting style towards his adult son.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend's son, Junior, is 18 and lives with him. The author feels that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and indulgent, which the author finds creepy. Examples include constant affectionate gestures, catered attention like opening umbrellas, tucking in, using pet names, etc. The author tried to address this and it led to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is a partner, not a parent, so her role is different. She's concerned about the relationship boundaries between the boyfriend and his adult son. The boyfriend might feel that his parenting style is being criticized, which can be sensitive. On the other hand, the author is expressing her discomfort, which is valid. \n\nBut the key points are: Is it appropriate for the author to bring up this issue? Was her approach respectful and constructive? The author tried to be \"tactful\" but it turned into an argument. The boyfriend got defensive, which is common when someone feels their parenting is under scrutiny. \n\nThe author might be overstepping if she's not considering the boyfriend's perspective or if she's not respecting his parenting choices. However, she's also within her rights to express concerns about her partner's behaviors that affect their relationship. The question is whether her intervention was justified.\n\nLooking at the examples, some behaviors like tucking in an adult, excessive affection, and using pet names could be seen as overstepping typical parent-child boundaries once the child is an adult. So the author has a valid concern. But how she approached it might have been problematic. Arguing and leaving might not be the best approach for resolution.\n\nThe boyfriend's defensiveness suggests he feels his parenting is being judged, which can be a sensitive topic. The author's cultural background (more reserved in expressing affection) might influence her perception, but that doesn't invalidate her feelings. However, she needs to consider that the boyfriend's behavior might be seen as a natural extension of his affectionate nature, not necessarily unhealthy.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, since Junior is an adult, the father's behavior could indeed be overbearing. The author's concern might be about enabling dependency or creating an unhealthy dynamic. However, the author's role here is a partner, not a parent, so she needs to navigate this carefully without overstepping into parenting advice.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author has valid concerns but might have approached the situation in a way that caused conflict. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the context. If her intent was to improve the relationship and she communicated respectfully, maybe not. But if she was critical without considering his perspective, she might be overstepping.\n\nThe answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). Considering all this, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong because her concerns are valid and she tried to address it. However, her approach could have been better. But according to the question, if the answer is B (Not in the wrong), that would be the choice.\n"
