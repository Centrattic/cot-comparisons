From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he has an unhealthy relationship with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's 18-year-old son lives with him full-time. The boyfriend is very affectionate towards his son, with a lot of hugs, \"I love you's,\" and other actions like tucking him in, cleaning his car, and using pet names. The woman thinks this is over the top and could be unhealthy, especially since she comes from a more reserved background. She tried to talk to him about it, but it led to an argument. Now she's wondering if she was wrong to bring it up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the boyfriend's behavior toward his son genuinely inappropriate or is the woman overreacting? Are there cultural or personal differences at play? Also, is it reasonable for her to express her concerns in a relationship where they're in a committed, long-term partnership (since they're both in their late 30s/40s and the son is 18, so presumably the boyfriend is the father or a stepfather)?\n\nThe woman is concerned about the dynamic between her boyfriend and his son. The boyfriend's actions might be seen as excessive, especially since the son is an adult. While affectionate gestures are common between parents and children, when the child is 18, expecting a parent to do things like vacuuming their car or tucking them in might be considered overindulgence. The use of pet names like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" could also be seen as inappropriate for an adult child, possibly even suggesting an overly close or codependent relationship.\n\nHowever, the woman's approach is important. She tried to address it tactfully, but the conversation escalated into an argument. Timing and delivery might have played a role. Also, the boyfriend's defensiveness suggests he might be sensitive about how he relates to his son, which is understandable if he's a single parent or has a history of being criticized.\n\nBut considering that the woman is in a committed relationship with the father of this son, it's reasonable for her to have concerns about the family dynamics, especially if it's affecting their relationship. The fact that the son is 18 and living at home full-time might mean that the boyfriend is enabling dependency, which could be a valid concern. The woman isn't just criticizing the boyfriend for his parenting style but pointing out potential issues that could hinder the son's independence.\n\nHowever, the woman might need to approach the topic more carefully, perhaps by discussing her feelings without accusing him directly. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for bringing it up. In many relationships, partners do discuss family dynamics, especially when they affect their partner's well-being or their relationship. So, the act of expressing her concerns isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be how she communicated it, but the question is about whether she overstepped boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's defensiveness and the resulting argument suggest that the topic is sensitive. But the woman's intent was to address what she sees as an unhealthy situation. If the boyfriend is indeed enabling an unhealthy relationship, then bringing it up is justified. However, if her criticism is based on her own upbringing and not considering cultural or personal differences, she might be projecting her own discomfort onto the situation.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for voicing her concerns, especially in a committed relationship. However, the way she approached it might have contributed to the conflict. The key is whether the behavior is genuinely problematic. Given the examples (like the umbrella incident, tucking in an adult, etc.), there might be valid concerns about overindulgence. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong), as raising valid concerns about family dynamics in a relationship is reasonable, even if the method of communication could be improved.\n"
