From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he has an unhealthy relationship with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is 42, his son is 18 and lives with him. The author (F38) feels the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and coddling their son in ways she finds inappropriate. Examples include excessive hugs, using pet names, doing things like opening an umbrella for the son when it rains, vacuuming his car, etc. When she brings it up, he gets defensive, and they argue. Now she's questioning if she overstepped.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in co-parenting relationships and whether it's appropriate for a partner to critique their significant other's parenting style, especially if they're not the parent. The boyfriend is the legal parent, so he's responsible for his son. The author is his girlfriend, not the child's mother, so her role might be more about supporting him rather than making parenting decisions. However, she's concerned about the dynamic and feels it's unhealthy.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, partners often have the right to voice concerns about each other's behavior, but the context matters. If the parenting style is actually harmful, then it's a valid concern. But if it's just different from her own upbringing, maybe she's overstepping. The boyfriend's actions might be seen as overprotective or enabling, but that's subjective. The argument could be about whether the author has the right to critique his parenting, especially if it's not her child.\n\nHowever, in some cases, partners do step in when they see potential issues, especially if it could affect the family dynamic. The author might not be in the wrong if she's genuinely concerned, but the way she approached it could matter. She tried to be tactful but it turned into an argument, so maybe the method wasn't effective. But the core issue is whether the concern itself is valid.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior might be within normal parenting, even if it's more affectionate than average. Or it could be a red flag. If the son is 18, he's an adult, so some of these actions (like tucking him in, using pet names) might be inappropriate for that age. The key is whether the author is overstepping by commenting on his parenting style as a partner. In many relationships, discussing such things can be tricky, but it's not inherently wrong to express concerns, especially if the partner is close to the parent.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her concerns. She's in a committed relationship, so it's reasonable to discuss issues that affect their living situation or the well-being of the son. However, the way she brought it up and the resulting conflict might need to be addressed. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not the method. Since she's a partner, it's not necessarily overstepping. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
