From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (F38) who is in a relationship with a man (M42) who has an 18-year-old son, is in the wrong for expressing concerns about how the boyfriend interacts with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend's behavior includes excessive affection and over-catering to his son, like tucking him in, using pet names, and doing things like vacuuming his car. The author thinks some of these actions are inappropriate, like being creepy with the affection. The boyfriend got defensive when she brought it up, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries in blended families, appropriate parent-teen interactions, and communication in relationships. The author is worried she overstepped by bringing up her concerns, but she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem to border on overprotectiveness or over-familiarity, especially since the son is 18, an adult. Using terms like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" might be seen as too close, especially if it's in front of others. The author's reaction is based on her own background where affection was rare, so she's uncomfortable with the level of affection shown. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong for pointing this out. Generally, in a relationship, discussing concerns about in-law interactions is valid if they affect the relationship. However, the approach matters. The author tried to be tactful, but it turned into an argument. The boyfriend getting defensive might indicate that he's sensitive about his parenting style. \n\nIs the author wrong to express her discomfort? Not necessarily. It's important for her to communicate her feelings, especially if it's causing her distress. However, maybe she could have approached it differently, perhaps focusing on her own feelings rather than judging his parenting. But the main issue is whether she overstepped. Since she's part of the household now, especially with the boyfriend's son living with them, her concerns about how their dynamic affects their relationship are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend's actions are just a product of his personality (being affectionate) and not harmful. The son is an adult, so some affection might be normal, but the over-catering (like the umbrella incident) might indicate overprotectiveness. The author's perspective is that it's creepy, which is a judgment, but she's stating her feelings. \n\nIn terms of AITA, if the boyfriend's behavior isn't harming anyone but is making the author uncomfortable, she's not in the wrong for expressing that. However, the way she brought it up might have been a problem. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not if her approach was perfect. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for voicing her concerns about the relationship dynamics affecting their partnership.\n"
