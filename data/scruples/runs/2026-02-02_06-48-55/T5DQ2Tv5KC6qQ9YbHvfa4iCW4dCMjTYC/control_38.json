  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend that he has an unhealthy relationship with his son?\nMy (F38) boyfriend (M42) has an 18 year old son I'll call Junior, who lives with him full time. From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend and his relationship with his 18-year-old son. The author is concerned that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and catering to his son in ways that seem inappropriate. The key here is to determine if the author overstepped by bringing this up.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: the son is 18, an adult, so the level of care might be excessive. Tucking him in, using pet names, and such could be signs of an overprotective or enmeshed relationship. The author is pointing out that these behaviors might be unhealthy. But the boyfriend is defensive, which suggests he might not see it the same way.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they come from a less affectionate background, so their discomfort might be influenced by cultural or personal upbringing. However, the issue is whether the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The author is voicing their concern, which is a valid thing to do in a relationship to express boundaries and their feelings. \n\nBut the question is about overstepping. The author is in a romantic relationship with the boyfriend and has a right to express concerns about how his actions affect their relationship. However, the way the argument went might matter. The author says they tried to be tactful, but it turned into an argument. Maybe the approach could have been better, but the act of bringing it up isn't inherently wrong. The issue is whether the topic itself was out of bounds. Since the boyfriend's behavior might be affecting the relationship, the author has a right to voice concerns. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have a legitimate concern about the dynamic that affects their relationship. However, the delivery might have been an issue, but the act of expressing it isn't overstepping. The boyfriend's defensiveness could be a problem too. The author isn't wrong for wanting to discuss it.\n"
