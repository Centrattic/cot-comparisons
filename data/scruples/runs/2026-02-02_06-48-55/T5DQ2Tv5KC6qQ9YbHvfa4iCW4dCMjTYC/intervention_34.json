From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about her boyfriend's relationship with his son. She's criticizing the way he's overly affectionate and catering to his son, which she finds creepy. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his son live together, and the son is 18. That's an adult age, so maybe expectations are different. The author mentions that the boyfriend does things like tucking him in, using pet names, and doing things like vacuuming his car. She's from a family where affection was less, so maybe her perspective is influenced by her background. \n\nThe boyfriend is defensive when she brings it up. The author left in a huff, leading to a cold agreement. The question is whether she overstepped. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is a parent, and parenting styles can vary. What's considered normal for some might not be for others. The son is an adult, but still living with his dad, so maybe the dynamic is different. The author is part of the household now, so she might feel it's affecting them.\n\nBut, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as overprotective or overly indulgent. Using terms like \"spoiled rotten\" and \"has his father wrapped around his finger\" suggest the author believes the son is being spoiled. However, is it her place to judge? She's the girlfriend, not the mother. The boyfriend might feel she's invading his parenting decisions.\n\nAlso, when discussing this, the argument turned heated. Maybe she approached it in a way that made him defensive. The key here is whether her intentions were to genuinely help or if she was being critical. If she's concerned about the relationship's health, maybe she should collaborate with him to address it, rather than just criticizing.\n\nBut the son is an adult, so perhaps the boyfriend's behavior is more about their relationship than parenting. If the son is manipulating the affection, that's a different issue. The author might be valid in her concern if the dynamic is unhealthy, but how she communicated it matters.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, as a partner, she might have a right to express concerns if it affects their relationship. However, the method and timing could be an issue. Maybe she should have approached it more gently, or sought to understand before criticizing. The fact that the son is an adult adds another layer; the father's behavior might be enabling or codependent.\n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? It's possible she's not entirely wrong, but maybe she could have handled it differently. The answer might depend on cultural norms, the boyfriend's perspective, and how the communication was handled. But the question is whether she overstepped. If the boyfriend felt defensive and the discussion led to a breakup or cold phase, maybe she did overstep, especially if she wasn't respecting his role as a parent. On the other hand, if the relationship is affecting their partnership, discussing it is important.\n\nHmm, I'm torn. But since she's the girlfriend, not the parent, maybe she overstepped by criticizing his parenting. Unless she's part of the parenting decisions, which isn't indicated here. So, answer A: Yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
