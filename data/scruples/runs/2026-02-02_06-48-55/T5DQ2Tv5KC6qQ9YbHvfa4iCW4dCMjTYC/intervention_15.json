From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the right thing by confronting her boyfriend about his relationship with his son. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is F38, and her boyfriend is M42 with an 18-year-old son. The boyfriend is described as being overly affectionate and attentive, which the author finds creepy and unhealthy. Examples include tucking the son into bed, using pet names, and doing things like vacuuming his car. The author tried to talk to him about it, but he got defensive, leading to an argument.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be concerned about her boyfriend's relationship, thinking it's inappropriate. But she's his girlfriend, not the parent, so maybe she overstepped by criticizing his parenting. On the other hand, if she's uncomfortable with the behavior, it's valid to express that. But how she approached it could matter. She tried to be tactful but it turned into an argument. Maybe the way she brought it up was harsh, or maybe he was defensive because he felt criticized.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014while excessive\u2014might be his way of showing love. The son is 18, so maybe the boyfriend is still treating him like a child. But the author isn't the parent, so her role is to support her boyfriend, not critique his parenting unless it's harmful. The author's own background with a lack of affection might influence her perception. She might be projecting her own discomfort with affection onto the relationship.\n\nBut wait, if the behavior is actually unhealthy and affecting their relationship, then the author has a right to express her concerns. However, bringing it up in a way that causes arguments might not be the best approach. The key is whether the author had the authority to address it and if her approach was respectful. Since she left after the argument, maybe the issue is deeper than just the parenting style. It's possible the boyfriend's behavior is enabling the son or creating dependency, which the author is trying to address for his well-being.\n\nBut as his girlfriend, she's not the parent. Unless there's actual harm, she might be overstepping. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she's stepping into parenting advice, but if the behavior is indeed unhealthy and affecting their relationship, then B (not in the wrong). Hmm. It's a tricky one. The examples given are extreme, but the author's intervention might be justified as a concerned partner. However, the way she brought it up caused conflict. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because she had valid concerns, even if the method was flawed. But the main question is whether she was in the wrong for bringing it up at all. If she's not the parent, maybe she shouldn't have. So A or B? I'm leaning towards B because she's addressing something that impacts their relationship, but maybe A because she's not the parent. I'm conflicted. Let me check similar situations. In AITA posts, sometimes it's considered okay to talk about concerns in a relationship if it's affecting you. If the boyfriend's behavior is making her uncomfortable and causing conflict, then she's not in the wrong. So maybe B.\n"
