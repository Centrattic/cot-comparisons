From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (F38) is in the wrong for confronting her boyfriend (M42) about his over-attentive behavior towards his adult son, Junior. The boyfriend has an 18-year-old son living with him, and the author feels the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and coddling, which seems creepy from her perspective. The boyfriend got defensive and arguments happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is a 42-year-old father to an 18-year-old son. While 18 is considered an adult, it's common for some parents to still be involved in their child's life, especially if the child is in high school or living at home. The boyfriend's actions\u2014like using pet names, hugging a lot, and doing things like vacuuming the car\u2014might be seen as overstepping by some, but others might see them as normal parental care. \n\nThe author's perspective is influenced by her own background where affection was less common, making her uncomfortable with the boyfriend's level of affection. She tried to discuss it tactfully but ended up in an argument. The key question is whether she overstepped by bringing up the issue. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for partners to communicate their concerns, especially if certain behaviors are causing discomfort. However, the way the author approached it might be a factor. Did she choose a good time to talk? Did she present her concerns respectfully? She said she tried to be tactful but the boyfriend got defensive. It's possible that the boyfriend felt his parenting was being criticized, which can be a sensitive area. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as enabling or overprotective. If Junior is an adult, some of the boyfriend's behaviors (like worrying about rain, tucking him in) might be inappropriate. The author might have a valid concern about the dynamic being unhealthy. \n\nHowever, whether she is in the wrong depends on how she approached the conversation. If she was respectful and focused on her feelings rather than accusing him of poor parenting, she might not be at fault. But if she came off as judgmental or criticized his parenting style without considering his perspective, that could be problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend's defensiveness suggests that he might feel his actions are normal or justified. The author's own background might affect her interpretation, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to express her discomfort. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to express her concerns and how she did it. Since the question is whether she overstepped, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if she communicated her feelings without attacking him. However, if she crossed into criticizing his parenting without understanding his situation, it's more A. Given the information, she tried to be tactful but the argument ensued. It's possible she's not in the wrong because addressing relationship dynamics that affect her is part of a healthy partnership. So I lean towards B.\n"
