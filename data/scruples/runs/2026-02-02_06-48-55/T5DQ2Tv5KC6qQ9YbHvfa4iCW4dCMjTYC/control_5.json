From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 38-year-old woman, criticizing her boyfriend's (42) parenting style towards his 18-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's son, Junior, is 18 and lives with him. The author feels that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and overindulgent, giving examples like tucking him in, using pet names, and going out of his way to protect him from getting wet in the rain. The author tried to address this, leading to an argument. Now she's wondering if she overstepped.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up her concerns. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The boyfriend is the father, so he has the right to parent as he sees fit, but there's a line where it could be considered overprotective or enabling. The author's concern might be valid if the behavior is indeed overstepping typical parent-child boundaries, especially since the son is 18, an adult. However, the author is not the parent, so her role is to support her partner unless there's harm involved.\n\nThe author's motivation is concern, but she might have approached it in a way that was critical or judgmental, leading to defensiveness. The boyfriend's defensiveness could be because he feels his parenting is being criticized. The key factors here are whether the behavior is harmful and if the author had the right to bring it up.\n\nIf the behaviors are typical for a parent and not harmful, then the author might be overstepping. However, if the boyfriend's actions are enabling dependency or not allowing the son independence, then the author's concern is valid. The examples given do seem like overindulgence for an adult son. The author's approach might have been tactful, but the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt criticized. \n\nIn such cases, it's important whether the author had a right to voice her concerns. Since she's in a romantic relationship with the boyfriend, she might have a right to express her comfort level, especially if it affects their relationship. However, if her criticism is based on personal discomfort rather than actual harm, then she might be overstepping. The line here is tricky. If the author's actions were meant to help and not to control, then she's not wrong. But if she's being judgmental without considering cultural or personal differences, she could be.\n\nThe author mentions her own upbringing with less affection, so her discomfort might stem from that. The boyfriend is naturally affectionate, so the behavior might be normal for him. The issue is whether the author has the right to criticize his parenting. In most cases, unless there's abuse or neglect, parents have autonomy. However, the boyfriend might need to consider his adult son's autonomy as well. \n\nThe author's approach led to conflict, which is a red flag. She might not be entirely wrong if the behavior is indeed problematic, but the way she approached it could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the approach. If the boyfriend's actions are harmful, then the author isn't wrong to raise it. If not, then she might be overstepping.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's concerns are valid in terms of enabling overprotection for an adult son, but she's not the parent. However, in a relationship, discussing concerns about each other's behaviors is normal. The real issue is whether her criticism was justified. Given the examples, it seems like the boyfriend is being overprotective of an adult, so the author's concern is reasonable. However, bringing it up in a way that caused a major argument might have been unwise. But overall, she's not necessarily in the wrong for expressing her concerns about something that could affect their relationship.\n"
