From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who has an 18-year-old son living with him. She's concerned that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and doting on his son in ways she finds inappropriate. She gives examples like the boyfriend using pet names, doing things like vacuuming the son's car, and fussy behavior even when it's raining. The boyfriend gets defensive when she brings it up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is the father, so his relationship with his adult son is his own, but the author is his partner now. She's not the mother or the legal guardian, so she's stepping into a role where she's commenting on how he's parenting. But wait, he's not her child, so maybe she's overstepping by giving her opinion?\n\nBut then again, in a committed relationship, partners often discuss concerns they have about each other's behaviors. However, this is about parenting a child who's 18, which is an adult. Is it normal for a father to still be doing things like tucking in his son or using pet names? Maybe some people are more affectionate by nature. The author comes from a family where affection was less, so her perspective might be influenced by her background. \n\nThe key points are whether her intervention was appropriate. She tried to address it tactfully but it turned into an argument. The boyfriend was defensive, which is common when someone is criticized about their parenting. She left the argument, and now they're in a cold place. The question is if she was wrong to bring it up.\n\nI think the issue is that she's the girlfriend, not the parent. Her concern is about the father-son relationship, which is the father's domain. Unless there's something abusive or harmful, it's his choice. She might be projecting her own discomfort with affection onto the situation. However, if the father's behavior is enabling the son or creating dependency, that's a different matter. But since the son is 18, it's his choice whether to accept that or not. The author's role is to discuss her feelings with her partner, but she might have overstepped by labeling it as \"unhealthy\" without evidence.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she's intervening in a relationship that's not her own, especially since the father is doing what he feels comfortable with. Unless there's actual maltreatment, it's his parenting style. She should focus on her own feelings and how to express them without dictating his parenting.\n"
