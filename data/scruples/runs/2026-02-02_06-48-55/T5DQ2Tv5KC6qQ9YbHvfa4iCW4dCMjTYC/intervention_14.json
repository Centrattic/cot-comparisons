From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend about his unhealthy relationship with his son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has an 18-year-old son, Junior, living with him. The author notices that Junior seems spoiled and that the boyfriend is overly affectionate, which she finds creepy. Examples include the dad panicking over rain, tucking in the son, using pet names, and doing things like vacuuming the car. The author tried to talk to her boyfriend, but it led to an argument. Now she's wondering if she overstepped.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the nature of the relationship between the dad and son. At 18, the son is an adult, so the level of parental involvement might be too much. The author is concerned about the dynamic, possibly seeing it as overprotective or enabling. But is she in the wrong for bringing it up?\n\nThe author's perspective is that she comes from a less affectionate background, so maybe she's more sensitive to this. But she's his girlfriend, so it's reasonable for her to have concerns about his relationship with his son. However, the boyfriend might feel that she's overstepping into his parental role. The question is whether her approach was appropriate.\n\nShe tried to address it tactfully but it turned into an argument. He got defensive. Maybe she didn't present it in the best way, but is she wrong for voicing her concerns? If the relationship is indeed unhealthy, bringing it up isn't inherently wrong. However, if the way she approached it was confrontational or judgmental, that might be an issue. The examples given do suggest overindulgence, which could be a valid concern.\n\nBut since she's not the parent, her role is to support her boyfriend, not to dictate his parenting. However, as a partner, she might feel it's affecting their relationship or her comfort. The challenge is balancing her concerns with respecting his autonomy as a parent.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's possible that she overstepped by judging his parenting style. Parents often have different approaches, and unless there's actual harm, her criticism might be unwarranted. But if the behavior is truly inappropriate or enabling, she might have a point. The answer hinges on whether her concerns are valid and how she expressed them.\n\nGiven that the son is 18 and the father's actions seem excessive, maybe the author has a valid concern. However, the way she brought it up led to conflict. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because addressing a potential issue isn't wrong, but the method could be improved. Alternatively, A if she shouldn't have judged his parenting. It's tricky. The examples do show overindulgence, so maybe she's justified, making the answer B.\n"
