From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the woman in the situation) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he has an unhealthy relationship with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and his 18-year-old son live together. The boyfriend is very affectionate towards his son, using pet names, doing things like tucking him in, vacuuming his car, and being overly protective (like worrying about rain). The author feels this is inappropriate and unhealthy. She tried to talk to him about it, he got defensive, they had an argument, and now she's questioning if she overstepped.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author had the right to express her concerns about her boyfriend's relationship with his son. \n\nFactors to consider: \n1. The boyfriend's son is 18, an adult. The father's behavior might be overprotective or enabling. \n2. The author is in a romantic relationship with the father. How much should she intervene in his parenting decisions?\n3. The boyfriend didn't take her concerns well, got defensive. This could indicate a problem in their communication or his resistance to her input.\n4. The author's own background with affection might influence her perspective, but does that affect the validity of her concerns?\n\nParenting decisions are generally up to the parent. Even if others think it's excessive, unless there's neglect or abuse, it's not necessarily someone else's place to intervene. However, the son is an adult, so the father's behavior might be seen as overstepping into the son's autonomy. But in many cultures, parents of 18-year-olds might still be involved in their lives, especially if they live together. \n\nThe author's concern is about the dynamic being unhealthy. But unless she's a guardian or has legal standing, she might be overstepping by judging and criticizing his parenting. Relationships can become strained when one partner criticizes the other's family dynamics, especially if it's a sensitive topic. The boyfriend's defensiveness suggests that this is a touchy subject for him, which she might not have anticipated.\n\nHowever, if the author is genuinely concerned about her partner's well-being or the son's, and feels that her partner is being manipulated or enabling poor behavior, she might have a valid point. But the line between concern and overstepping is thin. Since she's his partner, she might have a responsibility to bring it up if it's affecting their relationship or if she feels it's harmful.\n\nIn terms of the argument and the aftermath, the way she approached it (tactfully) but still caused a conflict might indicate that she did overstep, especially if the boyfriend felt it was an intrusion into his parenting. The fact that they're now in a cold place suggests that her approach may have been too direct or not well-timed.\n\nIn conclusion, while her concerns might have merit, as a partner, she might not be the best person to judge his parenting. Unless there's harm involved, it's usually a parent's role to make those decisions. So the author might have overstepped by criticizing her boyfriend's relationship with his son, leading to the conflict.\n"
