From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting her boyfriend about his relationship with his 18-year-old son, which she perceives as unhealthy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend's son is 18, which is an adult age. The author is concerned that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and coddling the son, like using pet names, doing things like vacuuming his car, and worrying about driving in the rain. These actions might be seen as appropriate if the son were younger, but at 18, the author might be right to question whether this is fostering independence.\n\nThe author came from a less affectionate background, so her perspective might influence her judgment. But the main issue is whether she overstepped by bringing up her concerns. The boyfriend got defensive, and they had an argument. The question is if she was wrong to do so.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address something that she sees as a problem in the relationship. It's her right to express concerns about her partner's behavior if it's affecting their relationship. However, she might have approached it in a way that was not constructive, leading to a defensive reaction. Also, considering that the son lives with his father and is an adult, the father's behavior might be a red flag if it's preventing the son from becoming independent.\n\nBut the author's intention seems to be genuine, not to control her boyfriend but to express her discomfort. However, the way she brought it up caused conflict. Maybe she didn't frame it as a concern about the son's independence rather than the boyfriend's actions. Or perhaps she should have discussed it more privately and calmly.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, when you're in a relationship with someone who has children, discussing concerns about their parenting can be tricky. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing her concerns, but she could have handled it better. The boyfriend's defensiveness might indicate he's sensitive about his relationship with his son, which is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's approach was appropriate. If she expressed her worries respectfully and constructively, maybe she wasn't wrong. But if she was confrontational or criticized his parenting without considering his perspective, that could be the issue. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt criticized, which might have led to the argument. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for voicing her concerns, especially if she believes it's affecting their relationship. However, the way she approached it could have been more tactful. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. The key is whether she overstepped by making it a big issue when perhaps she should have discussed it more carefully. But given the context, since she's part of the relationship and the dynamic with his son might be affecting their relationship, it's reasonable for her to express concerns. So I think the answer is B.\n"
