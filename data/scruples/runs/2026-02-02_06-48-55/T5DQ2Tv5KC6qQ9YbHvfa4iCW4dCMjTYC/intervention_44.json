From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 38-year-old woman, and her 42-year-old boyfriend who has an 18-year-old son living with him. The main issue is that the author is criticizing her boyfriend's behavior towards his son, which she describes as overly affectionate and indulgent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, which is an adult age, but still living at home. The boyfriend's actions include things like using pet names, tucking him in, and doing things like vacuuming his car. The author finds these actions creepy and believes they indicate an unhealthy relationship. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now curious. The key points here are boundaries in relationships and the appropriateness of the boyfriend's actions. The boyfriend's behaviors might be seen as excessive by some, but since he's the parent, there's a cultural and familial context where such actions could be considered normal. \n\nThe author brought up the issue, leading to a conflict. The boyfriend got defensive, which is a common reaction when someone's parenting style is questioned. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nI should think about whether the boyfriend's actions are actually problematic. Pet names and affectionate gestures might be typical for some families, even with adult children. However, the author is uncomfortable with the level of attention, possibly due to her own background where affection was less common. Her perspective is valid, but the issue is whether commenting on her boyfriend's parenting is within her boundaries. \n\nSince the son is still living with his father, the boyfriend likely maintains a close relationship. The author might be concerned about the dynamic between them and potential enmeshment, but it's his family, and unless there's abuse or neglect, her criticism could be seen as meddling. \n\nThe argument that followed suggests that the boyfriend felt his parenting was being attacked, which can be a sensitive topic. The author's approach to address the facts but still causing a defensive reaction might indicate she didn't handle it well. \n\nSo, weighing this, the author's concern is understandable, but as a partner, she might not be the one to dictate how he should parent. Unless there's a legal or ethical issue, it's a personal matter. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) for overstepping, but I need to make sure there's no red flag in the boyfriend's behavior. The examples given don't mention abuse, just overindulgence and affection, which are subjective. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
