From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a woman in a relationship with a man who has an 18-year-old son. The author is criticizing the boyfriend's behavior towards his son as being overly affectionate and coddling, which she finds creepy. The boyfriend became defensive, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about her boyfriend's relationship with his son, pointing out specific behaviors like excessive affection, using pet names, and doing things like vacuuming the son's car. She comes from a background where such affection was absent, so her perspective is influenced by her own experiences. The boyfriend, however, is in a different place emotionally, and the author's intervention led to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. The boyfriend is the legal guardian of his son, and as a parent, he has the right to parent in a way that he deems fit unless it's harmful. The author is not his parent, so she's not in a position to dictate how he should parent. Even if others might see his actions as over-the-top, unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse, it's not her place to interfere. \n\nThe author's own discomfort stems from her upbringing, but that doesn't mean the boyfriend's actions are wrong. The fact that the son is 18, living at home, and still receiving such attention could be seen as enabling dependency, but again, unless it's causing harm, it's his choice. The author's approach of confronting the boyfriend directly led to conflict, which suggests that she might have approached the issue without considering his feelings or the boundaries of their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate, but the author might have overstepped by making a public judgment about his parenting. The boyfriend's defensiveness is a natural reaction, as parenting is a sensitive topic. The author should have considered discussing her feelings without accusing him of wrongdoing regarding his son. However, her concern might be valid, but her method of addressing it was perhaps not the best. \n\nSo, the key here is whether the author had the right to intervene. Since the boyfriend is the parent, and there's no indication of harm, the author's role is that of a partner, not a parent. Her actions could be seen as overstepping because she's critiquing his relationship with his son, which is a personal matter. Therefore, the answer would likely be that she is in the wrong (A), as she's imposing her views on parenting where she shouldn't.\n"
