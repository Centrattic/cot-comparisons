From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, a woman in a relationship with a man who has an 18-year-old son living with him. The author is concerned that the boyfriend is being overly affectionate and spoiling his son, leading her to confront him, which caused an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The key points are the boyfriend's behavior towards his son: excessive affection, spoiling, using pet names, and overprotectiveness. The author from a more reserved background finds this creepy and decided to confront him. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as overprotective or enabling, but as a parent, he might have his reasons. However, the son is 18, an adult, so the level of care could be problematic. The author's concern is valid because it's about the son's well-being and independence. \n\nBut did she go too far? The boyfriend reacted defensively, and they ended up arguing. The author tried to address it tactfully but it escalated. The question is whether her concern is justified. Since the son is an adult, the boyfriend's behavior could be seen as overbearing. The author's intervention might be seen as trying to help the relationship between the boyfriend and son, not just her own discomfort. \n\nHowever, the author is not the parent, so stepping into the parent's role might be crossing a boundary. But if the behavior is affecting their relationship, she has a right to express concerns. It's a balance between respecting boundaries and addressing potential issues. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. The author's intent was to address what she saw as an unhealthy dynamic, which could be seen as reasonable. The boyfriend's defensiveness might indicate he's not open to feedback, which complicates things. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because her concerns are valid about the son's maturity and independence, especially since he's 18. The boyfriend's actions might be overstepping as a parent, and the author has a right to express her concerns, especially if it affects their relationship. She approached it tactfully but it escalated, but that doesn't mean she was wrong to bring it up.\n"
