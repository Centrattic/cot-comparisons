From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he has an unhealthy relationship with his son. The boyfriend's son, Junior, is 18 and lives with him. The author notices that the boyfriend is overly affectionate and catering to Junior in ways she finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the father, so she's stepping into his parenting role. But she's not the mother, so where does her concern come from? She mentions that her own family wasn't affectionate, so maybe her perspective is influenced by her upbringing. She points out specific examples like the umbrella incident, tucking in the son, using pet names. These could be signs of overindulgence or enmeshment.\n\nThe key question is whether the author overstepped. In a relationship, partners often discuss concerns about each other's behaviors, but when does it cross into being in the wrong? The boyfriend might see this as his personal parenting style, while the author feels it's affecting their relationship. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was defensive, leading to an argument. The author tried to bring it up tactfully but it escalated. The issue here is whether her intervention was appropriate. If the son is 18, some independence is expected, but the father's behavior might be overbearing. However, the author is a partner, not a parent, so she's not the one responsible for parenting decisions. But if the dynamic is affecting their relationship, she might have a valid concern.\n\nIs there a line crossed? The author's examples do seem excessive. For example, getting an umbrella for the son in the rain, vacuuming the car, etc. These actions could be seen as spoiling. But the father might see them as caring. The author's judgment may stem from her own values versus his. But is it her place to criticize his parenting? That's the crux.\n\nIn relationships, partners should communicate concerns, but they also need to respect boundaries. If the author's main issue is the affection level, maybe she should focus on how it affects their relationship rather than the parenting itself. However, she did express her concerns, leading to conflict. Maybe she should have approached it differently, but is she in the wrong? Possibly, if she's overstepping by critiquing his parenting. Alternatively, if the behavior is truly harmful, she might be justified. But since the son is 18, there's also the aspect of the son's autonomy. If the father is enabling dependence, that's a problem. But the author's role is complicated here.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's intervention was justified. Since she's not the parent, criticizing his parenting decisions might be overstepping. Unless there's actual harm, her concern is based on her own standards. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn because the behavior does seem excessive. However, the line is thin between concern and overstepping. The boyfriend's defensiveness suggests it's a sensitive area, and the author's approach might have been too direct without addressing the impact on their relationship specifically. So maybe she's in the wrong for the approach, but not the concern itself. Hmm. The question is whether she's in the wrong for bringing it up. If the answer is B, then she's justified. But given that she's a partner, not a parent, maybe A is correct. I think the correct answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she's expressing a legitimate concern about the dynamic affecting their relationship, but the way she presented it might not matter as much as the validity of the concern. However, since the user initially thought she was in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Another angle: The boyfriend might feel his parenting is being criticized, which can be a sensitive area. The author's approach led to conflict, but she had valid points. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
