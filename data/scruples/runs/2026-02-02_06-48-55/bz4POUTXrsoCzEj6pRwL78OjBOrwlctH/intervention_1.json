It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to reenact their motorcycle trip honeymoon, but the author is uncomfortable and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, has never ridden one, and it scares them. The parents gave an itinerary, gear, and cash, expecting them to do the trip. The author politely declined, leading to conflict with the parents and fianc\u00e9, who took their side. The parents were upset, even screamed, and called the author unappreciative. The author feels attacked and is seeking validation if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to comply. Let's break it down. The author's autonomy and comfort are important. The fianc\u00e9's parents had their own dream, but imposing it on their son and his fianc\u00e9e might be overstepping. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a problem because major life decisions should involve both partners. The parents gave a significant gift (expensive motorcycle) expecting compliance, which can be seen as pressuring them into something without their consent. The author has the right to express their preferences, even if it disappoints others. However, the way the author handled the rejection might matter. Were they polite but firm? The post says they were direct but polite. The parents overreacted, which is their issue, not the author's.\n\nSo, the key factors here are consent, autonomy, and the pressure from the parents. The author isn't obligated to do something they're uncomfortable with. The parents and fianc\u00e9's reaction is more concerning than the author's refusal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
