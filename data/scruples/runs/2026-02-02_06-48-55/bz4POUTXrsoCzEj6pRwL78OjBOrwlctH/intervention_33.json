It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, who's engaged, is being pressured by the fianc\u00e9's parents to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon. The parents gave a motorcycle as a gift without consulting the author, who isn't interested in motorcycles and found the situation stressful. The parents reacted negatively when the author declined.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without discussing it with them. The parents presented a motorcycle, which the author finds scary and uninteresting. The author politely declined, but the parents reacted harshly, making the author feel attacked. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue is autonomy in marriage. The fianc\u00e9's parents are imposing their own desires onto the couple without respecting the author's preferences. The author has the right to express their own interests, especially since they're the one getting married to the son. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went along with it without consulting the author shows a lack of communication and partnership.\n\nThe parents' reaction seems inappropriate. Screaming and making the author feel unappreciative for a gift they didn't want is not a healthy response. Gifts should be given with consideration for the recipient's wishes. The author isn't obligated to accept a gift that doesn't align with their interests, especially when it's a significant amount of money and a life-changing activity like a motorcycle trip.\n\nAlso, the author is not being selfish here. They're standing up for their own boundaries. The parents' dream shouldn't override the author's comfort and preferences. Marriage is a partnership, so both partners should be on the same page about major decisions, especially those involving shared experiences or expensive purchases.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's role is also important. If he had discussed this with the author beforehand, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since he didn't, it's part of the problem. The author's response was appropriate in asserting their stance politely but firmly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their own needs and have the right to decline a gift that doesn't suit them. The parents and fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of respect for the author's autonomy and preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
