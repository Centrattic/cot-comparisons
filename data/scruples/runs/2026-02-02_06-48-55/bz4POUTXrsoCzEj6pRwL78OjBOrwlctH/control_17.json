It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to take a motorcycle trip, similar to their own honeymoon. The author doesn't like motorcycles and is scared of them. They were given a motorcycle and gear without consulting them, and when they said no, they got a harsh reaction from the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 (the author's partner) didn't consult them about the gift or the plan. That's a big red flag. Major decisions, especially involving significant money and personal preferences, should be discussed between partners. The parents might have their own wishes, but they shouldn't impose their expectations on the author without considering their feelings.\n\nThe author expressed their lack of interest politely but directly. The parents responded with criticism and accusation, which is unkind and unfair. The parents' reaction seems over the top, especially since the author wasn't consulted. The fact that they bought the motorcycle without the author's input shows a lack of respect for their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect matters. A motorcycle in that price range is a substantial gift, but it's not the author's responsibility to accept it or use it. The parents' claim that the author is unappreciative is misplaced because the gift was given without discussion. The author's right to have their preferences respected is important here.\n\nMarriage involves compromises, but this isn't a situation where the author is refusing a reasonable request. The trip is a personal dream of the parents and the fianc\u00e9, but it's not something that should override the author's comfort and personal preferences. The parents' dream doesn't need to become the author's obligation.\n\nSo putting it together, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do the trip. They were given a gift that wasn't discussed with them, and their refusal was met with hostility. The parents and fianc\u00e9 made the decision without considering the author's feelings, which is a major issue. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
