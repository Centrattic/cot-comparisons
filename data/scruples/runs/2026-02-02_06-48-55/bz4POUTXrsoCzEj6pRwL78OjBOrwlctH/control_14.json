It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle honeymoon trip. The author, the fianc\u00e9's future spouse, has no interest in motorcycles and is scared of them. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents presented it along with an itinerary, gear, and cash. The author politely declined, but the parents and fianc\u00e9 reacted negatively, leading to a confrontation where the author feels attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and personal preferences. The author clearly states they have no interest in motorcycles and are scared. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss this with them, which is a problem because it's a shared decision, especially involving money and activity. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially screaming and making the author feel unappreciative. \n\nThe author's response was polite but direct, which is reasonable. They have the right to express their preferences, even if it disappoints others. The parents' actions, including the surprise gift and the subsequent criticism, seem overreaching. The fianc\u00e9's role in not consulting the author is also a significant issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their disinterest. The problem lies with the fianc\u00e9 and parents for not respecting the author's wishes and the lack of communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not the author's fault).\n"
