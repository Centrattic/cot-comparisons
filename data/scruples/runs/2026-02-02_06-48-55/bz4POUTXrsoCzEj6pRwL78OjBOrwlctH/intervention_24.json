It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 being pressured to recreate their partner's parents' motorcycle trip. The author received a motorcycle as a gift without prior discussion and is now being criticized for not wanting to do the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was not consulted about the motorcycle or the trip. They have no interest in motorcycles and it's making them uncomfortable. The in-laws are pressuring them, even to the point of screaming. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with them either.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical perspective, respecting someone's autonomy is important. The author has the right to express their preferences, especially in a marriage where mutual respect is key. The in-laws imposing their dream on the author without considering their feelings is problematic. Also, the fianc\u00e9's role in not discussing it with the partner is a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author's refusal isn't about rejecting the partner but about personal preferences. The in-laws' reaction seems over the top and disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
