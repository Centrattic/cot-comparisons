It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon. The author received a motorcycle as a gift, but they're scared of motorcycles, never rode one, and aren't interested. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them and the parents reacted negatively when they declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was given a motorcycle without prior discussion. They expressed their lack of interest and fear, but the in-laws reacted hostilely. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to do something that's important to the fianc\u00e9's parents but not to them.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they were pressured into a situation they're uncomfortable with. They didn't have a say in the decision, which was made by the fianc\u00e9 and parents. When they declined politely, they faced backlash. The parents' reaction seems overly harsh, especially screaming and calling them unappreciative. The fianc\u00e9 also failed to support the author's feelings by not discussing it beforehand.\n\nIn terms of rights and expectations in a relationship, both partners should have autonomy in their decisions. The author isn't obligated to follow the in-laws' wishes, especially if it causes them distress. The parents' insistence and the fianc\u00e9's lack of support contribute to the problem. The author's refusal isn't disrespectful; they expressed gratitude but declined. The parents' response was the issue, not the author's stance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their own preferences and should be respected. The in-laws overstepped by not considering the author's feelings and reacting aggressively. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
