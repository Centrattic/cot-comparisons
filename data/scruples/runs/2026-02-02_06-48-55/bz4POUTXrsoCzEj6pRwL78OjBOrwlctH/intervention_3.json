It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is terrified of motorcycles and has no interest. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents became confrontational when she declined.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main argument is that she never wanted it, has no interest in motorcycles, and felt pressured. The fianc\u00e9 acted without her input, which is a red flag. The parents reacted angrily, even screaming and implying she's ungrateful. The author's response was polite but direct, which seems reasonable. \n\nMarriage requires mutual respect and communication. The fianc\u00e9 should have discussed the idea with her first, especially since it's a significant and personal decision. The parents pushing their own desires onto the couple might not consider the author's feelings. Their reaction to her refusal\u2014calling her a \"piece of shit\"\u2014is clearly inappropriate. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing her lack of interest. She's within her right to decline something that makes her uncomfortable. The real issues lie with the fianc\u00e9 not consulting her and the parents not respecting her stance. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
