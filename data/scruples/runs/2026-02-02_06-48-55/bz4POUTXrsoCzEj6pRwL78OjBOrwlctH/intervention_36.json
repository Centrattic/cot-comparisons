It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon, but the author has no interest and is scared of motorcycles. They received a motorcycle as a gift and were pressured, leading to a confrontation where the mother screamed at them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is engaged and being pressured to do something they don't want. They expressed their disinterest politely but were met with hostility. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them before getting the motorcycle. The parents seem to have made a significant financial investment without considering the author's feelings. \n\nThe main issue here is autonomy in relationships. The author has the right to express their preferences, especially in a marriage. The parents and fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic because they didn't respect the author's wishes. The fianc\u00e9's actions of buying the motorcycle without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the author's voice in their relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They clearly communicated their disinterest, which is a valid response. The backlash from the other three suggests that the problem isn't the author's refusal but the others' inability to accept it. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a cultural expectation or tradition I'm missing. However, the situation seems to hinge on personal preferences and mutual respect. Since the author isn't forcing anyone else to do something, and they're standing by their own choice, they aren't the asshole here.\n"
