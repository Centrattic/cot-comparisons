It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate a motorcycle trip for their honeymoon, but the author isn't interested. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents got angry when they refused. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is engaged, so it's a significant life decision. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a specific tradition they wanted their son and his spouse to follow. However, the author has no interest in motorcycles and is scared of them. The fianc\u00e9 didn't talk to the author before getting the motorcycle, which is a problem because it's a joint decision.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should be on the same page about major plans. The fianc\u00e9 didn't communicate with the author, which shows a lack of respect for her preferences. The parents then pushed the author, leading to a confrontation. The author's refusal was polite and direct, but the parents reacted strongly, even screaming. That's a hostile response and not healthy.\n\nThe key points are: the author was given a surprise without being consulted, the parents imposed their expectations, and the author's feelings were dismissed. The author's stance is about respecting their own interests and safety. They have the right to say no to something they don't want. The parents and fianc\u00e9 acted without considering the author's perspective, which is where the issue lies. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves.\n"
