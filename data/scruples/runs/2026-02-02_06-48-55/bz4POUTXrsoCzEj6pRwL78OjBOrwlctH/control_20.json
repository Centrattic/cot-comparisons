It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip for their honeymoon. The author is the fianc\u00e9's partner, and they're not interested in motorcycles, scared of them, and don't want to do the trip. The parents gave a motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash, and when the author declined, the parents reacted negatively, even screaming. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's main points are that they don't want to do the motorcycle trip, they were given all the stuff without consulting them, and when they said no, they were criticized. The parents and the fianc\u00e9 had already planned this without the author's input. The author feels pressured and treated poorly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting the other person's preferences and boundaries. The author is engaged, so they are entering a marriage, which should involve mutual respect and compromise. However, in this case, the decision was made by the fianc\u00e9 and his parents without the author's agreement. The author's discomfort and fear of motorcycles are valid reasons to not want to participate. \n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014screaming, implying the author is ungrateful, and putting them in a minority of one against three\u2014seems harsh and dismissive. The author was polite but direct, which is reasonable. Expecting someone to participate in something they're afraid of and have no interest in, especially after it's been planned without their input, is a problem. \n\nMarriage planning should involve both partners' consent and shared decisions. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went along with this without discussing it with the author first is a red flag. The author's right to make their own choices about their honeymoon should be respected. The parents' financial investment doesn't override the author's feelings and preferences. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to express their wishes, and the negative reaction from the others doesn't justify their position. The key here is that the author's autonomy and comfort are being respected. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
