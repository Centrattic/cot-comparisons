It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who bought a motorcycle without consulting her, leading to a confrontation with his parents. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is engaged and doesn't want to recreate her fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9's parents wanted this trip to be their dream for their son and his wife. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without discussing it with the author. The parents then presented the items and an itinerary, leading to a conflict where the author refused, and the parents reacted angrily.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author should be blamed. From the story, the author is clear about her lack of interest in motorcycles and her fear. She communicated her feelings politely but directly. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult her, which seems like a key problem. The parents then put pressure on her, leading to a hostile situation.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations around family traditions and individual autonomy. The parents had a dream for their son's marriage, but that doesn't necessarily extend to the author. She has the right to express her preferences, especially in a relationship where both partners should have a say. The fianc\u00e9's action of buying the motorcycle without discussion is a breach of communication. The parents' reaction is also problematic, especially the mother screaming and calling the author unappreciative.\n\nThe author's refusal isn't about rejecting a gift but declining an expectation imposed without her consent. The key factor is that the author wasn't consulted, which is a major red flag in relationships. The parents and fianc\u00e9's actions seem controlling, while the author is asserting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue about respecting family wishes, the author's right to autonomy is significant. The parents' reaction is extreme, and the author's fear and disinterest are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
