It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip that the fianc\u00e9's parents took on their honeymoon. The parents bought a motorcycle and presented it to the author, but the author isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared of riding them. The author said no politely but directly, and then the parents and fianc\u00e9 turned on them, making them feel like they're the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They didn't ask for the motorcycle, have no interest in it, and it's causing them anxiety. They communicated their feelings politely. The parents, on the other hand, seem to have made a large financial commitment and expected the couple to follow through without consulting the author. The fianc\u00e9 didn't talk to the author first, which shows a lack of communication and respect for the author's feelings.\n\nThe parents reacted harshly, even screaming and making personal attacks. That's pretty aggressive. The author is in a vulnerable position here, being engaged and now facing pressure from their future in-laws and partner. The key points are consent, respect for individual preferences, and the parents' overreaction. \n\nThe author isn't the one who initiated the idea, they were given a choice after the fact. By not consulting them, the fianc\u00e9 and parents didn't respect the author's autonomy. The author's refusal is their right, and the others' backlash is the real issue here. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. The parents and fianc\u00e9 are the ones who didn't consider the author's feelings and acted out when plans didn't go as expected.\n"
