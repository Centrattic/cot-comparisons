It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 being pressured by their in-laws to take a motorcycle trip like the husband's parents did on their honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, who isn't interested in motorcycles and feels scared by them. The in-laws gave a motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash, and when the author refused, they were criticized harshly.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are that the author's partner bought into the plan without talking to them, and the author was pressured by three people (the partner and the two parents) despite not wanting to do the trip. The author expressed their feelings politely but directly, yet was met with hostility. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they don't want to do something they're not interested in, especially when it's a significant expense they didn't agree to. The partner and in-laws seem to have decided this without the author's input, which is a problem. The author is not obligated to participate in something that goes against their comfort and interests. The in-laws' reaction was hostile, which is unacceptable. \n\nThe author isn't the one who pushed for the trip without discussion. They were given a present they didn't want, and their refusal was met with criticism. The partner's actions in buying into the plan without consulting the author are a key factor here. The author is standing up for their own preferences, which is a valid response. The in-laws overstepped by pressuring them and making derogatory remarks. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have every right to decline the trip and express their feelings. The partner and in-laws are at fault for not respecting the author's wishes and for the hostile reaction.\n"
