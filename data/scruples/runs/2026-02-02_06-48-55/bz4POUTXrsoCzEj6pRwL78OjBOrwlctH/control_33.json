It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is engaged and their fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate their motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, who has no interest in motorcycles and is scared of them. The parents presented the motorcycle and an itinerary, and when the author refused, they were criticized and yelled at. The author is now feeling attacked and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 made a decision without discussing it with their partner. That's a problem because major life decisions, especially ones involving significant expenses and personal preferences, should involve both people. The motorcycle was expensive and not something the author wanted, which shows a lack of consideration for their feelings and preferences.\n\nNext, the parents' reaction was hostile. Screaming and making the author feel like they're in the wrong isn't healthy. The parents' dream shouldn't override the author's comfort and preferences. Marriage is supposed to be about mutual respect and compromise. The parents and fianc\u00e9 pushing their own desires without considering the author's is where the issue lies.\n\nThe author was polite but direct in declining. They expressed appreciation but also their lack of interest, which is reasonable. The backlash from the family was unwarranted. The author isn't the asshole here because they're standing up for their own needs and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9 and parents should have discussed this with the author first and respected their decision if they didn't want to do the trip. So the answer is B.\n"
