It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate a motorcycle trip that the parents did for their honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without consulting the author. They got a motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, has never ridden one, and finds them scary. When they politely declined, the fianc\u00e9's parents and the fianc\u00e9 turned against them, with the mother even screaming about the expense and calling the author unappreciative.\n\nFirst, the author is engaged to be married, so this is a significant life decision. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss this with the author before presenting the plan. That seems like a problem. When you're engaged, major plans involving both of you should be discussed together. The parents' expectation that the couple would recreate their trip is their dream, but it's not the author's. They made it clear they weren't interested, but the response was hostile.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The fianc\u00e9 went along with the parents' plan without the author's input, which breaches the trust and partnership in a marriage. The author's right to express their preferences should be respected. The parents' reaction, especially the mother screaming and making the author feel like they're a \"piece of shit,\" is unkind and unfair. The author isn't obligated to fulfill someone else's dream if it goes against their wishes and comfort.\n\nThe author tried to be polite and direct, which is reasonable. The backlash they received from the fianc\u00e9 and parents doesn't justify the author's stance. The parents should have considered the author's feelings and the couple's shared interests instead of pressuring them. The fianc\u00e9's failure to support the author's decision and instead joining the criticism is a red flag in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't. The pressure from the parents and the fianc\u00e9, along with the lack of prior discussion, points to the others being at fault. The author is standing up for their own preferences, which is healthy. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
