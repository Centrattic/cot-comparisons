It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip they took on their honeymoon. The author is given a motorcycle, gear, and money, but they don't want to do it because they're scared and have no interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was not consulted by their fianc\u00e9 about this plan. The presentation was unexpected, and the parents reacted negatively when the author declined. The parents even screamed and called the author unappreciative. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check in with the author first, which seems like a big issue.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss this with the author, so the author is being pushed into something they don't want. The parents' reaction is also problematic\u2014they're pressuring the author and making them feel like an asshole for not complying. The author isn't the one who initiated the idea, so they can't be blamed for not wanting to go along with it. The parents and fianc\u00e9 made the decision without the author's input. \n\nThe main factors here are lack of communication and the pressure exerted by the parents. The author is being set up for something they're uncomfortable with, and the parents are taking it out on them. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to express their preferences and should be respected. The answer should be B.\n"
