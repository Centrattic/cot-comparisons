It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon, but the person is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, who's the one being presented with it. The author isn't interested and expressed that politely but directly. The parents and fianc\u00e9 then reacted negatively, even the mom screaming that the author is unappreciative. The author is feeling attacked and shaken.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to do this. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's right to have their own preferences is important. Marriage is about two people's plans, not just following the other's family's dreams. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a problem. The parents pushed their own desires onto them, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about personal fears and interests. The parents' reaction\u2014calling the author a \"piece of shit\"\u2014is clearly inappropriate and aggressive. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The fianc\u00e9's parents and the fianc\u00e9 himself are at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and for the hostile response. The author tried to be polite, which is reasonable. The pressure from the family is the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the lack of prior discussion, the author's right to their preferences, and the family's hostile reaction. The author's stance is valid, and the family's behavior is what's problematic here.\n"
