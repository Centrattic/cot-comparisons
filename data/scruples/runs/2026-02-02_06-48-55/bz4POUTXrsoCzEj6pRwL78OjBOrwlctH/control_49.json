It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip, but the author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author. The parents then present the idea as a gift, which includes a motorcycle the author isn't interested in. The author politely declines, but the parents and fianc\u00e9 react negatively. The author feels attacked and defensive.\n\nI think the key points are consent and communication. The fianc\u00e9 didn't ask the author if they wanted this trip. The parents pushed it, and the author is not comfortable with motorcycles. The author's reaction is to decline, which is a valid personal choice. The parents' response was aggressive, which isn't healthy. So the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The real issue is the fianc\u00e9 and parents not respecting the author's preferences. So the answer should be B.\n"
