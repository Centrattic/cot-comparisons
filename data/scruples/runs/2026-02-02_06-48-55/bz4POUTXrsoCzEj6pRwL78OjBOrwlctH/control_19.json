It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon, but the author isn't interested.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is engaged, and the future parents-in-law have a history of a motorcycle trip as a honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without talking to the author. They received a motorcycle, gear, and money for the trip. The author expressed their disinterest politely but directly. The parents then reacted strongly, even screaming, and the author feels attacked.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to do the trip. The author's reasoning is that the trip isn't what they want. They have no experience or interest in motorcycles and find them scary. The parents and fianc\u00e9 are pressuring them, making them feel like the bad guy.\n\nI should consider the principles of relationships. In a marriage, both partners should have a say in major decisions, especially something as significant as a honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a problem. The author has the right to express their preferences, especially when it's something they're uncomfortable with. \n\nThe parents' reaction seems excessive. Spending a lot of money on a trip that the other person doesn't want to do can be seen as inconsiderate. The author isn't rejecting the gesture out of spite but because it's not their preference. They're being honest about their feelings, which is important in a relationship.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to participate in something that's important to the fianc\u00e9's family but not to them personally. Relationships require compromise, but they also require respecting individual boundaries. The author is advocating for their own needs and preferences, which is a healthy aspect of a relationship.\n\nSo, looking at all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
