It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles, has no interest, and didn't like being pressured. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents got upset when she refused.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 made a decision without her input, which is a problem because major decisions like this should involve both partners. The parents' reaction was aggressive, screaming and making her feel like the bad guy. The author was direct and polite, yet faced hostility. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, each partner's preferences should be respected. The parents had their own dream, but the author has her own feelings and fears. It's not about right or wrong in a legal sense, but about mutual respect. The author isn't obligated to fulfill someone else's dream, especially when it's something she's scared of. The fianc\u00e9's lack of consultation and the parents' hostile reaction are on their side. The author standing up for her feelings is valid. So, she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
