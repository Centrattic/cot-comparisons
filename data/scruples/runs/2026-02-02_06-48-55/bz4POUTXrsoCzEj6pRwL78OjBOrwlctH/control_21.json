It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting to recreate the fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip for their honeymoon, even though the parents have pushed for it.\n\nFirst, the author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents have a history with motorcycle trips. They bought the author a motorcycle without consulting them and set up an itinerary. The author isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared of them. The parents reacted negatively when they refused, even yelling and calling them ungrateful.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is at fault. Well, the author is expressing their own preferences. It's their right to choose what they want for their honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them either, which is a problem. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially since the author clearly stated their position politely. The parents' spending a lot of money on something the author doesn't want is also an issue.\n\nSo the main points: the author is not wrong for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The fianc\u00e9 and parents overstepped by making a decision without their input and then reacting aggressively. The author's refusal was respectful, so they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
