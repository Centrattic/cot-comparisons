It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to recreate their fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip as a honeymoon. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9's parents own a motorcycle dealership and had their own motorcycle honeymoon. They want their son and the author to do the same. The fianc\u00e9 bought into this idea without discussing it with the author. Then, during a dinner, the author was given a motorcycle, gear, and cash for the trip. The author is not interested in motorcycles and feels scared by them. They politely declined, but the in-laws reacted negatively, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to evaluate the situation objectively. \n\nKey points: The author was given a significant gift (motorcycle, gear, money) without prior discussion. They had no interest in motorcycles and expressed their refusal politely. The in-laws and fianc\u00e9 reacted with hostility, implying the author is ungrateful and ruining their dreams. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the trip wasn't their desire. They have the right to set boundaries and make their own choices for their honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9's parents pushing their own dream onto the couple without considering the author's preferences is a problem. The author's refusal, while polite, was met with aggression, which is unkind.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? No. They're not obligated to do something they're uncomfortable with, especially when it's a significant part of their life (a honeymoon). The responsibility lies more with the fianc\u00e9 for not consulting the author and the parents for pressuring them. The author standing up for their own preferences isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
