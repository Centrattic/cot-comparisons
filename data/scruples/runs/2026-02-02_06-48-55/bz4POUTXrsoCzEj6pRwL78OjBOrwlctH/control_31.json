It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents have a history with motorcycles. They own a dealership, and their own honeymoon was a motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author and just presented a new motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash. The author says they have no interest, never rode a motorcycle, and are scared. The parents and fianc\u00e9 reacted negatively, even the mom screamed. The author is now feeling attacked and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's preferences not being respected, lack of communication from the fianc\u00e9, and the strong reaction from the family. The key question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they clearly communicated their lack of interest politely and directly. They were given a gift that they didn't ask for and aren't interested in using. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with them first, which is a problem. The parents overstepped by pressuring them and reacting angrily, especially the mom's screaming. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they have valid reasons for not wanting to do the trip.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that the author should be more flexible for the fianc\u00e9's parents' wishes. However, it's the author's honeymoon, and their own interests should matter. The main issue is the lack of consent and the family's reaction. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while respecting family traditions is important, it shouldn't override the individual's comfort and preferences. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to do something they're scared of and have no interest in. The fianc\u00e9 and parents are at fault for not discussing it and pressuring them. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author's refusal is valid, and the family's reaction is inappropriate.\n"
