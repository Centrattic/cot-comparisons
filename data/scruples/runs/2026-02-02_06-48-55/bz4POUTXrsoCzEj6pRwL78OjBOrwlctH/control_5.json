It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, presented it as a gift, and the parents got upset when she refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was given a motorcycle they don't want, which is a significant and expensive gift. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss it with them first, which is a problem because major life decisions, especially involving expensive purchases and personal preferences, should be mutual. The parents were pushy and even yelled, which is not acceptable behavior. The author expressed their disinterest politely but was met with hostility. \n\nThe main issue is consent and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Honeymoons are traditionally about the couple, not fulfilling someone else's dream unless both parties agree. The author has a valid right to not want to do something that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's a fear of motorcycles. The parents' reaction was over the top, using money as a guilt-trip. The fianc\u00e9's actions of making the purchase without discussion also contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. They communicated their feelings, and the parents overreacted. The fianc\u00e9's lack of communication is a separate issue but doesn't reflect the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
