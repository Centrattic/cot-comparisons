It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, has no experience, and finds them scary. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents presented it at Sunday dinner. The author rejected the idea politely but directly, leading to the parents and fianc\u00e9 getting angry, with the mom even screaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being pressured to do something they don't want to do. The main issue is respecting personal preferences and autonomy in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9 and parents didn't consult the author before making the plan, which is a problem because it's a joint decision affecting both partners. The author's response was polite but clear, which is reasonable. The parents' reaction was hostile, which is not acceptable. The fianc\u00e9 should have discussed this with his partner before committing to the parents' idea. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their preferences. The fianc\u00e9 and parents are overstepping by making the decision unilaterally. The author's refusal is valid, and the hostile reaction is on the other side. Therefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
