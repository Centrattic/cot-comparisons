It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip for a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and has no interest. They were given a motorcycle and gear without being consulted, and then confronted when declining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was not consulted about the plan, which is a big issue. Honeymoon plans should be a mutual decision between the couple, not something imposed by family. The parents and fianc\u00e9 pushed it without considering the author's preferences. The author clearly communicated their discomfort and refusal politely, but the parents reacted negatively, even screaming. That's a hostile reaction, which isn't appropriate.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's parents had their own dream, but it's not fair to expect their son's partner to fulfill it. The author's right to personal preferences and safety should be respected. Motorcycles are a specific fear, and forcing someone into a situation that terrifies them is unreasonable. The fact that the parents spent a lot of money doesn't justify pressuring the author to participate. The key here is consent and mutual agreement in relationships. The author isn't the asshole here; they're standing up for their own boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
