It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon, but the author has no interest in motorcycles and was given a motorcycle and pushed to do this without consultation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is engaged, so they're getting married in August. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon. The author's fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without talking to them. The parents then presented a motorcycle and an itinerary. The author declined politely, and the parents reacted negatively, even yelling and calling them unappreciative. The author feels shaken and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants another opinion. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't want to do this trip, have no interest in motorcycles, and were given expensive gifts without consultation. Declining this as their own choice shouldn't be a problem. The parents' reaction seems over the top, especially since it's not their trip to enforce. The fianc\u00e9 not discussing it with the author first is also a red flag. In a marriage, both partners should agree on such plans, especially when it's a significant expense and activity.\n\nOn the other side, the parents might see this as a meaningful tradition they want their child to experience. But forcing their will on the other person in the marriage is unfair. The author's right to their own preferences should be respected. The parents' response of screaming and attacking the author for not complying isn't healthy, and the fianc\u00e9's failure to involve the author in the decision shows a lack of communication.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their lack of interest. They have the right to their own desires and should not be pressured or shamed for it. The problem lies with the fianc\u00e9 and parents for not respecting the author's autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
