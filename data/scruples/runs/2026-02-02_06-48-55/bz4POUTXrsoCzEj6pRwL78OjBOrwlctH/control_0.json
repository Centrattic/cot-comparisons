It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author isn't interested and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 didn't talk to them about this plan. The parents presented a motorcycle they didn't know about, and the author isn't into motorcycles. The parents got upset and even screamed, making the author feel attacked. The author was polite but firm in declining.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to do something that the fianc\u00e9's parents really want. The author's autonomy and personal preferences are important here. Marriage is about two people, not just family expectations. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them first, which is a problem because it's a major decision affecting both partners. The parents' reaction seems over the top, especially with the screaming and financial pressure. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish; they're expressing their genuine feelings. The parents' dream shouldn't override the couple's own desires. Also, the financial aspect is a red flag. The parents spending a lot of money without considering the couple's preferences is problematic. The author isn't the asshole here because they're standing up for themselves. The fianc\u00e9 and parents are the ones in the wrong for not respecting the author's wishes. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have every right to decline something they don't want, especially when it's a significant decision in their marriage.\n"
