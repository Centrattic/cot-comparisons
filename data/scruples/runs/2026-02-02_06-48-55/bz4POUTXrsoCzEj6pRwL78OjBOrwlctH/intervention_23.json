It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9, without consulting them, bought a motorcycle for a planned trip as a way to recreate their parents' honeymoon. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, finds them scary, and refuses the plan. The fianc\u00e9's parents react negatively, calling the author ungrateful and confrontational.\n\nFirst, the key points: The fianc\u00e9 made a big decision without the author's input, which is a problem in a relationship. The parents pushed the trip as their dream, but the author isn't interested. The author declined politely but was met with hostility. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to go through with the trip.\n\nMy initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to their preferences. Marriage planning should involve mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 and parents didn't consider the author's feelings here. The author's refusal is a personal choice, not a betrayal. The parents' reaction is over the top, especially since the author didn't initially refuse but declined politely. The fianc\u00e9's failure to consult the author first is also a fault. So the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). But wait, maybe I should consider if the author could have communicated better or if there's a cultural expectation involved. However, the story doesn't mention any prior discussion about the trip or the author's disinterest in motorcycles. The parents' spending a large amount on the motorcycle without the author's consent complicates things. Still, the author's right to not want to do something they're uncomfortable with is valid. The parents and fianc\u00e9 pushed too hard without respecting the author's feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
