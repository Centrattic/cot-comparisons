It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is engaged to be married, and their fianc\u00e9's parents, who owned a motorcycle dealership, took a motorcycle trip across multiple states as their honeymoon. The future mother-in-law has always wanted her son and his wife to recreate that trip. The fianc\u00e9 apparently went along with this idea without talking to the author first. They were given a new motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and money. The author has no interest in motorcycles, is scared of them, and politely declined. However, the in-laws reacted negatively, calling the author unappreciative, and the mother screamed at them. The author is now feeling shaken and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about other opinions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a specific dream for their son and his spouse to recreate their motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author before presenting the motorcycle and the plan. The author is not interested and expressed that politely. The in-laws reacted strongly, even to the point of screaming and accusing the author of ruining their dreams. The author was given a lot of money and items without prior discussion.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is being asked to participate in something they have no interest in and that makes them uncomfortable. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with the author first, which is a red flag. The in-laws are imposing their expectations without considering the author's preferences. The author's refusal is a personal choice, not a disrespectful one. The in-laws' response is extreme and dismissive of the author's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 and his parents made plans without involving the author. The author's right to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their time and money is valid. The in-laws' reaction is inappropriate, especially the screaming and labeling the author as unappreciative without understanding their perspective. The author did express their feelings politely, so they are not being disrespectful. The fact that the in-laws are taking it so personally and attacking the author's character suggests that the problem lies more with them and the fianc\u00e9 for not getting consent.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 and his parents should have discussed the idea with the author beforehand, respecting their autonomy. The author's refusal is a legitimate expression of their preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
