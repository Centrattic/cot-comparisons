It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and isn't interested. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents reacted badly when she declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is engaged, the parents have a dream for their son and his wife to reenact their own trip. The fianc\u00e9 went ahead and got a motorcycle without talking to the author. When she said no, the parents were upset and her mother even screamed. The author feels it's unfair and is questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting personal boundaries and communication. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author before getting the motorcycle, which is a big purchase and a significant decision for a honeymoon. The parents expected the author to comply without even discussing it with her. The author's refusal is a valid expression of her personal preferences and comfort. Honeymoons are personal, and it's reasonable for each person to have their own ideas about how to spend them. The parents' reaction seems aggressive, especially the mother's outburst, which is not appropriate. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to do something that makes her uncomfortable. The parents and fianc\u00e9 may have had good intentions, but they overstepped by not considering her feelings. The fact that the author communicated politely and directly shows she tried to be respectful. The backlash she received was unwarranted. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents and fianc\u00e9 are the ones who failed to communicate and respect her wishes. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
