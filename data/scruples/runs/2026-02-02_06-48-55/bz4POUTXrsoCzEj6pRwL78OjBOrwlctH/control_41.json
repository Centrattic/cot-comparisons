It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for not wanting to recreate the fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to reenact their honeymoon motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting her. The parents gave her the bike and an itinerary, but she's terrified of motorcycles and has no interest. She politely declined, but her in-laws reacted badly, even yelling and calling her ungrateful. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with her first, and the parents were aggressive.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author has the right to express her preferences. The fianc\u00e9's parents had their own dream, but forcing the couple to follow it isn't fair. The fianc\u00e9 should have discussed this with his partner. The author isn't obligated to participate in something she's uncomfortable with, especially when it's a significant expense and personal fear involved.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction\u2014screaming and making her feel bad\u2014shows poor communication. The author's response was polite, so she's not being unreasonable. The main issue is the lack of mutual discussion and respect for her feelings. The fianc\u00e9's actions (buying the motorcycle without her input) were probably wrong, but the author isn't the one at fault here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). The parents and fianc\u00e9 should have considered her feelings more.\n"
