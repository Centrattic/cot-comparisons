It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip, but the author is uncomfortable and declines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is engaged and the future mother-in-law has a dream that the couple should redo the parents' honeymoon trip. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author and presented a motorcycle without her input. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, finds them scary, and rejects the plan. The parents react negatively, even yelling, and the fianc\u00e9 is on their side. The author feels attacked and is seeking validation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for declining. The author's autonomy is important. They are within their right to say no to a trip they don't want to do, especially since it's their own life and preferences. The parents and fianc\u00e9 pushing the idea without respecting her wishes seems problematic. The fact that the parents spent a lot of money and then blamed the author for not being grateful might complicate things, but the right to make personal choices still stands. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 not discussing the plan with the author first is a red flag. The author's response was polite and direct, which seems reasonable. The parents' reaction\u2014screaming and making her feel like the bad guy\u2014suggests they didn't respect her autonomy. \n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, sometimes family traditions are pushed onto the next generation, but that shouldn't override individual preferences. The author isn't obligated to follow someone else's dream unless it's a mutual decision. The key here is whether the author's refusal was respectful and whether the pressure from the other side was excessive. The author did express appreciation and declined politely, so they're not being ungrateful; they're being true to their own desires. The pressure from the fianc\u00e9 and parents is more concerning. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. The issue lies with the others not respecting her wishes and reacting negatively.\n"
