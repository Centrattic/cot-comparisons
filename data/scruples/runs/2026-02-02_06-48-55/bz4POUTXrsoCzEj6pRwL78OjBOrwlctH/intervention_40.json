It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a future mother-in-law wanting the couple to recreate her parents' motorcycle trip for their honeymoon. The author says they don't want to do it, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them and they ended up being given a motorcycle. The author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to go, but the fianc\u00e9 and his parents are upset and even yelled at them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author about this trip, which is a big decision for a honeymoon. Honeymoons are supposed to be about the couple's preferences. The fact that the future mother-in-law made a big deal about it and screamed at the author suggests that the pressure was unreasonably high. The author tried to be polite but direct, which is reasonable when declining something you don't want. They might feel trapped because the gift was expensive and unexpected, but the core issue is that the fianc\u00e9 didn't check with them first. In relationships, both partners should have a say in major plans. So the author isn't wrong for not wanting to do something that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's not their idea to begin with. The fianc\u00e9 and parents are overstepping by not respecting the author's wishes and reacting negatively. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
