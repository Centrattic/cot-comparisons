It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is engaged to be married in August. The fianc\u00e9's parents, who owned a motorcycle dealership, took a motorcycle trip on their honeymoon. Now, the mother-in-law wants the couple to recreate that trip. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, presented it to them during a Sunday dinner, along with an itinerary and gear. The author has no interest in motorcycles and is scared of them. When they politely declined, the in-laws reacted negatively, with the mother screaming about the money spent and calling the author unappreciative. The author is now feeling shaken and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The main issue is the expectation from the fianc\u00e9's parents that the couple should recreate their trip. The fianc\u00e9 went along with this without discussing it with the author. The author isn't interested in motorcycles and has valid reasons\u2014never ridden one, scared, no interest. The in-laws reacted strongly, which escalated the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's refusal is about personal preference and safety. They were given a present they didn't ask for and had no prior knowledge about. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them, which is a problem. The author was polite but direct, which seems reasonable. The in-laws overreacted, especially the mother screaming and bringing up the cost. The author's reaction to being talked to that way is understandable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on major plans, especially those that involve significant financial commitments. The fianc\u00e9 going ahead without discussing with the author is a mistake. The author's right to have their own preferences and boundaries should be respected. The in-laws' reaction is inappropriate, especially attacking the author for not wanting to participate in something that's not their interest. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to do something they're uncomfortable with, especially when it's a gift they didn't request. The fact that the in-laws had their own dream for their son's marriage doesn't mean the author has to comply. The fianc\u00e9 should have considered both their interests. The author's refusal isn't unkind; they were polite and direct. The in-laws' response was hostile, which points to their fault, not the author's. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their feelings appropriately, and the in-laws overstepped by pressuring them and reacting aggressively. The fianc\u00e9's failure to consult the author is a separate issue, but it doesn't make the author at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
