It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip for their honeymoon, but the author isn't interested and has no experience or desire to ride. They received a motorcycle as a gift, which they weren't consulted about, and the parents reacted negatively when they declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without talking to the author. The author politely declined but faced backlash from the parents. The parents seem upset because their child's partner isn't following their dream for them. \n\nThe author isn't at fault here because they communicated their feelings politely. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 didn't involve the author in the decision, which is a problem in the relationship. The parents' reaction, especially the yelling and insults, is inappropriate. The author's right to have their own preferences is valid. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
