It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon. The author, the fianc\u00e9's future spouse, is not interested in motorcycles and is scared of them. They were given a motorcycle and gear without being consulted, and when they refused politely, the family reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about consent and respect. The fianc\u00e9 apparently went along with the plan without talking to the author first. The parents pushed for this trip without considering the author's feelings or preferences. The author expressed their disinterest politely, which is a reasonable response. The family's reaction\u2014calling them unappreciative and hostile\u2014is problematic. \n\nThe author didn't violate any boundaries; they communicated their stance. The issue seems to stem from the fianc\u00e9 and parents not respecting the author's autonomy and preferences. The fact that the author tried to be direct but was met with hostility suggests that the problem is on the other side. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to their own preferences and to decline something that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's a significant and expensive commitment. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
