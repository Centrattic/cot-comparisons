It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon, and the author is not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents have a history of a motorcycle trip on their honeymoon. The parents own a dealership, so maybe they have a connection to motorcycles. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author and just presented her with a motorcycle and gear. The author isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared. She politely declined, but her fianc\u00e9's parents reacted negatively, even screaming and implying she ruined their dreams. The author feels shaken and is questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue is the expectation of the parents to recreate a specific family tradition without considering the partner's preferences. The fianc\u00e9 went along with the plan without discussing it with his fianc\u00e9e, which is a problem because major decisions, especially those involving the partner's interests and safety, should be mutual. \n\nThe parents' reaction is aggressive and dismissive of the author's feelings. They gave a gift she didn't want and then criticized her for not being grateful. That's not respectful. The author's refusal was polite and direct, which is appropriate. She has the right to set boundaries and express her lack of interest. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The parents and fianc\u00e9 didn't respect her autonomy and preferences. The author isn't wrong for asserting her own desires in her upcoming marriage. The parents overstepped by imposing their own dream on the couple without consent. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The parents and fianc\u00e9 are at fault for not considering her wishes and reacting negatively.\n"
