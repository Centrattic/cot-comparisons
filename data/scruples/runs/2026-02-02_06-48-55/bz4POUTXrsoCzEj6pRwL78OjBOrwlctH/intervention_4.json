It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle honeymoon trip. The author (the fianc\u00e9's future wife) isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared of them. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting her, and the parents reacted negatively when she refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 made a decision without discussing it with his partner, which is a problem in a relationship. Communication is crucial, especially for major decisions. Then, the parents pressured the author into a trip she's not comfortable with, even to the point of screaming and making her feel like she ruined their dreams. That's a hostile reaction. The author was polite but direct in declining, but the parents didn't respect her boundaries.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. The author isn't the one who unilaterally decided the trip; the fianc\u00e9 did. The parents' reaction was aggressive. The author's refusal is about her personal comfort and safety. Motorcycles are a fear for her, so forcing her into that situation isn't fair. The fianc\u00e9's parents pushing their own dream onto the couple without considering the partner's feelings is an issue. Also, giving an expensive gift (motorcycle) without discussion adds pressure. The author's response was appropriate given the circumstances. The parents and fianc\u00e9 are at fault for not considering her feelings and respecting her decision. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
