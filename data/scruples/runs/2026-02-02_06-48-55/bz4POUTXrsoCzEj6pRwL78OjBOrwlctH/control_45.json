It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip for their honeymoon. The author doesn't like motorcycles, has no interest, and the parents and fianc\u00e9 are pressuring them. The fianc\u00e9 even bought a motorcycle without consulting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's refusal is justified. The key points here are about personal preference and consent. The author is clearly stating they're not interested in motorcycles and are scared. The parents and fianc\u00e9 pushed without checking in with them. The fianc\u00e9 bought the motorcycle without discussion, which is a big red flag. The parents are reacting negatively, calling the author ungrateful and even screaming. That's emotional abuse.\n\nMarriage requires mutual respect and considering each other's wishes. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, so their actions are problematic. The parents' reaction is also over the top, especially the mom screaming. The author is standing up for their own desires, which is valid. They're not obligated to do something they don't want, especially when it's a significant expense and a major life decision. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The main issues are lack of consultation from the fianc\u00e9 and the parents' overreaction. The author's right to express their preferences without being shamed is important. The fianc\u00e9's actions in purchasing the motorcycle without discussion are a big part of the problem. The parents are pressuring them inappropriately. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
