It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents pushing them to recreate a motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, even though the author is scared of motorcycles and has no interest.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is engaged, not married yet, and the trip is a family tradition. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents presented it without discussion. The author politely declined, but the parents reacted negatively, even yelling. The author feels pressured and shaken.\n\nNow, considering autonomy and consent. Since they're not married yet, the author's preferences should definitely matter. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss the idea with the author, which is a problem. They made a significant purchase and presented an itinerary without her input. That's a breach of communication and respect for her wishes.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also concerning. Yelling and screaming, especially about a large sum of money, is inappropriate. The author's refusal was polite, so the parents' response is over the top. The pressure from three people (her fianc\u00e9 and both parents) against her is a power dynamic that's not healthy, especially in a premarital situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author has no experience with motorcycles and they scare her is important. Forcing someone into an activity that makes them uncomfortable isn't respectful. The gift comes with conditions, which is a form of manipulation. The parents' dream shouldn't override the author's personal boundaries and comfort.\n\nLooking at societal norms, while family traditions are valued, they shouldn't take precedence over an individual's well-being. The author's stance is about respecting her own desires and not complying with something that causes her anxiety. The fianc\u00e9's failure to communicate with her is a mistake, but the author's refusal is valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the main issue is the lack of mutual agreement. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her preferences. The pressure from the family is the problem here. Marriage is about partnership, and making such a significant decision without discussion is a red flag. The author's reaction is justified given the circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 and parents should have discussed the plan before making arrangements. The author's polite refusal is reasonable, and the negative reaction from the family is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
