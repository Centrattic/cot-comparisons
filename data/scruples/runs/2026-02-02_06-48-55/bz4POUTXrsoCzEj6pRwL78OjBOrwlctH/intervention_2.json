It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip, but the author isn't interested and has no experience with motorcycles. The parents gave a motorcycle and pushed for the trip, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author isn't at fault for not wanting to do something they don't like. Marriage is about two people's choices, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author before committing them to this. The parents pushing their own dream onto the couple is problematic. Also, the mom screaming and being confrontational is extreme. The author stood up for their preferences politely, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 didn't include them in the decision, which is a key point. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
