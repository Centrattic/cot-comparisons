It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being pressured by their fianc\u00e9's parents to recreate a motorcycle trip for their honeymoon, which the author is not interested in. \n\nFirst, the author has a valid point about personal preferences. They mentioned never riding a motorcycle, no interest in it, and feeling scared. It's reasonable to not want to partake in an activity that's not their choice, especially for a significant event like a honeymoon. \n\nNext, the fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without consulting the author, which is a red flag. Communication is key in relationships, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't consider the author's feelings. Then, the parents presented the motorcycle without checking in with the author, leading to a confrontational situation. The parents' reaction, especially the mom screaming and making the author feel like a \"piece of shit,\" is over the top and disrespectful. \n\nThe author responded politely but directly, which is appropriate. They expressed appreciation but made their stance clear. The backlash from the family is unwarranted. The pressure to conform to someone else's dream without consent is problematic. \n\nMarriage is a partnership, and major decisions, especially those involving significant expenses and personal preferences, should be mutual. The parents' dream shouldn't override the couple's own desires. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The real issue is the lack of communication and respect from the fianc\u00e9 and his parents.\n"
