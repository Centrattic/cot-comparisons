It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip, but the author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents reacted negatively when she said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is engaged, so they're planning to marry. The parents have a tradition they want their son and his wife to follow. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with the author before getting the motorcycle. The parents then presented the motorcycle and an itinerary, leading to a confrontation where the author felt attacked.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for declining. In relationships, both partners should have autonomy and express their preferences. The parents' expectations might be well-meaning, but they shouldn't override the couple's own desires. The fianc\u00e9's lack of communication is a problem because he didn't discuss this with his fianc\u00e9e first. The parents' reaction\u2014calling the author unappreciative and screaming\u2014seems harsh. The author was polite and direct, which is reasonable. She's not obligated to do something she's uncomfortable with, especially when it's a significant expense and fear involved.\n\nAlso, the fact that the parents spent a lot of money doesn't mean the author has to comply. The trip involves safety concerns for her. The parents' dream shouldn't impose on the couple's choices. The author isn't being unkind; she's standing by her boundaries. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The parents and fianc\u00e9 should respect her decision.\n"
