It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is engaged and their fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip across several states as a honeymoon, just like the parents did. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting them, and presented it along with gear and cash. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, find them scary, and said they're not interested. The in-laws got upset, called them unappreciative, and made them feel like the bad guy.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and consideration. The author didn't have a say in this plan. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them, which is a problem because it's their honeymoon. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to do it\u2014they're scared, not interested, and have no experience. The in-laws reacted strongly, even to the point of screaming, which is inappropriate. \n\nExpecting someone to do something they're uncomfortable with, especially a major trip that's not their idea, seems unfair. The author isn't the one forcing the trip; they're objecting to it. The fianc\u00e9 and his family, on the other hand, made a unilateral decision and then blamed the author for not going along. That doesn't sound right. The author has the right to express their preferences about their own wedding and honeymoon. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, I think the author isn't at fault. They're standing up for their own comfort and safety. The issue lies more with the fianc\u00e9 not involving them in the decision and the in-laws overreacting. So the answer should be B.\n"
