It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The person is engaged and their fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon. The author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them and just presented a motorcycle and itinerary. The parents reacted angrily, even screaming, when the author refused.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is the asshole here. The key points are: the author is not interested in motorcycles, the fianc\u00e9 didn't communicate with them about the trip, and the parents overreacted. \n\nThe author's responsibility: They have the right to express their preferences and comfort in their own honeymoon. Marriage is a partnership, so both partners should agree on plans. The fianc\u00e9 made a decision without discussing it, which is a problem. The parents pushing their own dream onto the couple isn't fair either. \n\nThe author's response was polite but direct, which is reasonable. The parents' reaction was extreme, especially screaming and making them feel like an asshole. The author isn't at fault for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The fianc\u00e9's lack of communication is a bigger issue here, but the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They stood up for their own preferences and the parents overstepped. The fianc\u00e9's actions and the parents' reaction are more to blame here.\n"
