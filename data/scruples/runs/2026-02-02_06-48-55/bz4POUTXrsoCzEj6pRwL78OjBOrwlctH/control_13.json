It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon, but the author is not interested and feels pressured.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's partner bought a motorcycle without consulting them. The parents had a dream for their son and his wife to recreate the trip. The author isn't interested, has no experience with motorcycles, and is scared. They refused politely but were met with hostility from the partner's parents, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's perspective: They have the right to express their preferences. The partner made a decision without discussing it with them. The parents' reaction seems extreme. The author isn't obligated to do something they don't want to do, especially if it's something they find frightening.\n\nThe parents' perspective: They might feel it's a tradition or a meaningful family thing. But pushing their expectations onto the author without considering their feelings is problematic. The amount of money spent is high, but that doesn't mean the author has to comply.\n\nThe partner's part: He bought the motorcycle without consulting his fianc\u00e9e, which is a big oversight. Supporting his parents' wishes but not considering his partner's comfort is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author is standing up for themselves, which is valid. The parents' reaction turning hostile (screaming) is unhelpful and disrespectful. The partner should have discussed this with his fianc\u00e9e first.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do the trip. They communicated their feelings politely, and the backlash was unwarranted. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
