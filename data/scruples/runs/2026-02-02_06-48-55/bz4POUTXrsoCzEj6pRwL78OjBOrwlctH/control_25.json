It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and has no interest. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author and then the parents reacted negatively when the author refused.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they don't want to do the motorcycle trip. It's their right to have their own preferences, especially for something as personal as a honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9 and parents didn't consider the author's feelings or interests, which seems like a big oversight. The author was given a motorcycle without any prior discussion, which is pretty pushy.\n\nThe parents getting angry and calling the author unappreciative might be their own problem. The author was polite in declining, so the parents' harsh reaction could indicate their own issues rather than the author's fault. The fact that the author is engaged and this is a major decision that affects them both means the fianc\u00e9 should have discussed it first.\n\nAlso, the parents' dream shouldn't override the author's comfort and preferences. Honeymoons are about the couple, not necessarily about fulfilling someone else's dream. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're just not interested. The parents' spending a lot of money without considering if the author wants to use it seems like a problem on their side.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to decline and express their feelings. The real issue is the lack of communication from the fianc\u00e9 and the overreaction from the parents. So the answer should be B.\n"
