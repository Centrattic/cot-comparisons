It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip for their honeymoon, but the author is not interested and feels pressured.\n\nFirst, the author is engaged to be married in August. The fianc\u00e9's parents own a motorcycle dealership and did their own trip. The mom has a dream that the couple would do the same. The author's fianc\u00e9 bought into this idea without discussing it with them. At a dinner, they were given a motorcycle, gear, and cash for the trip. The author is scared of motorcycles, has no interest, and said they appreciated the thought but aren't interested. The parents reacted negatively, with the mom screaming about the cost and calling the author unappreciative. The author is now feeling shaken and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. So, is the author in the wrong here?\n\nWell, the key points are: the fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author before pushing for the trip. The author clearly communicated their discomfort and lack of interest in a polite way. The parents then reacted aggressively, which suggests they were unresponsive to the author's boundaries. The author isn't obligated to do something they don't want to do, especially when it's their own honeymoon. The parents' reaction of turning it into a 3 vs 1 situation and attacking the author's character makes it about their own expectations rather than respecting the couple's wishes. The author's response was appropriate\u2014expressing gratitude but declining. The parents overstepped by reacting with hostility. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
