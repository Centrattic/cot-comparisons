It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting the couple to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is not interested. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, and the parents are upset when she says no. The author is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is engaged to be married in August, so they're making plans for their future. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon, and they want the couple to do the same. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, is scared of them, and has never ridden one. The fianc\u00e9 gave her a motorcycle as a gift, along with gear and an itinerary, which she refuses. The parents then lash out, calling her ungrateful and implying she's ruining their dreams. The author feels attacked and is seeking validation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The main issue is about respecting the parents' wishes versus the author's personal preferences. The parents had their own dream for their son and daughter-in-law, which they wanted the couple to follow. However, the author has the right to her own preferences. The problem is that the parents and fianc\u00e9 didn't consult her before pushing the idea onto her. They gave her a motorcycle as a gift without her consent, which is a big commitment. The author is clear about her discomfort and lack of interest, which is valid.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's being forced into something she's not interested in. Marriage is a partnership, and both people should have a say in their shared plans. The parents' reaction\u2014screaming, implying she's ruining their dreams\u2014shows that they're not respecting her autonomy. The fianc\u00e9's role in buying the motorcycle without her input is also problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that they wanted to honor their own traditions and share a meaningful experience. But that doesn't override the author's right to make her own choices, especially in a marriage. The fact that the parents are reacting so strongly and not considering her feelings could indicate that they're in the wrong. The author's refusal isn't about being disrespectful but about being true to herself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to her own interests and should not be pressured into something she's not comfortable with, especially when it's a significant commitment like a motorcycle trip. The parents and fianc\u00e9 should have discussed this with her first and respected her decision. The way they're treating her is what's causing the conflict, not her refusal.\n"
