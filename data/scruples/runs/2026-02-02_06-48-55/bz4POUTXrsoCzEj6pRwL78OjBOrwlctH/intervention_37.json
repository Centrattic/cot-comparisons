It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and has no interest. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, and the parents reacted angrily when she declined.\n\nFirst, the author didn't want the trip. They have a valid reason: they're scared and not interested. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with them, which is a problem because it's their honeymoon. The parents presented it as a gift but didn't consider her feelings. The author politely declined, which is reasonable. The parents then blamed her, which is unfair. The key points here are about respect and consent. The fianc\u00e9 and parents should have discussed this with her first. She's not obligated to do something that goes against her comfort. The parents' reaction was hostile, which adds to the stress. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their feelings clearly, and the others didn't respect that. The answer should be B.\n"
