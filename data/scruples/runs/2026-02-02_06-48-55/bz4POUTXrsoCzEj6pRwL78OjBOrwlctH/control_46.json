It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being given a motorcycle and pressured to take a road trip similar to the fianc\u00e9's parents' honeymoon.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 bought the motorcycle without consulting the author. That's a red flag. Major purchases, especially ones that involve shared future plans, should definitely be discussed with a partner, especially when they have significant implications for both people involved. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 didn't check with the author before getting the motorcycle shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and preferences.\n\nThen there's the pressure from the in-laws. The author clearly states she's never ridden a motorcycle, has no interest in it, and finds them scary. The in-laws presented this as a dream they wanted the couple to fulfill, but the author isn't interested. The response from the in-laws was aggressive, with the mother screaming and implying the author was ungrateful. That's not healthy communication, especially in a family setting.\n\nThe author reacted politely but directly, which is reasonable. Expressing that you don't want to do something without being confrontational is a mature approach. The fact that the in-laws and fianc\u00e9 turned on her and blamed her for ruining their dreams indicates that the problem lies with their expectations and how they handled the situation, not the author's refusal.\n\nAlso, considering the financial aspect, the in-laws spent a large amount on the motorcycle, but that doesn't obligate the author to comply with their wishes. Everyone has different interests and boundaries, and a spouse should respect that. The fianc\u00e9's failure to involve the author in this decision and the subsequent pressure from the family are key issues here.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners' wishes are considered equally. The author is not wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and preferences. Being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything the other person or their family wants. The real issue here is the lack of communication and respect for the author's feelings and boundaries.\n"
