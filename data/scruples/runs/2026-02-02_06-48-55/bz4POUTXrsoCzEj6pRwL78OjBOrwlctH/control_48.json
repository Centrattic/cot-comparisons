It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared of them. They were given a motorcycle, gear, and money without being consulted, and when they declined, they were criticized by the fianc\u00e9 and his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was not consulted about the trip idea. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the parents' dream without checking with the author. The author made their feelings known politely but then faced backlash. The parents spent a lot of money, but the author isn't interested.\n\nThe main issue here is about autonomy and consent in a relationship. The author has the right to decide what they want for their honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9's parents imposed their dream without considering the author's preferences. The author's response was to decline politely, which is reasonable. The backlash from the fianc\u00e9 and parents seems unfair.\n\nI should also think about the pressure involved. The author was given gifts without their input, which could be seen as a way to pressure them into complying. The author's refusal was met with hostility, which is not acceptable. The fact that the author is now questioning their decision shows they're trying to be considerate, but they have a right to prioritize their own comfort and desires.\n\nSo, based on these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their stance, and the others overstepped by pressuring them. The answer should be B.\n"
