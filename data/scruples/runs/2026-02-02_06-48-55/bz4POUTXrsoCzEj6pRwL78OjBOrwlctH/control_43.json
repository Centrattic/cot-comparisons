It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to recreate their fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9's parents, who owned a motorcycle dealership, took a road trip on new motorcycles for their honeymoon. Now they want the couple to do the same. The author's fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting them, and the author is clearly not interested, scared even. The parents then reacted strongly, even yelling, making the author feel attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author hasn't ridden a motorcycle before, has no interest in it, and it scares them. They politely declined, but the in-laws and fianc\u00e9 reacted negatively. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to participate in a trip that's important to the in-laws but not to them.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners agree on plans, especially major ones. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a red flag. The in-laws pushing their expectations without considering the author's preferences seems unfair. The author's reaction is valid because it's their comfort and safety, and they have the right to say no. The parents overreacting by screaming and attacking the author isn't acceptable behavior either. \n\nThe author isn't the one in the wrong here because they communicated their feelings politely and had no prior interest in the activity. The pressure from the other three people doesn't make the author wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication and respect for the author's boundaries. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
