It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the LK is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 and their parents wanting to recreate a motorcycle trip honeymoon. The LK author (the fianc\u00e9) received a motorcycle as a gift, which they don't want because they're scared of motorcycles and have no interest. The parents got angry when they refused, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the LK is in the wrong. Well, the key points here are autonomy in relationships, gift-giving expectations, and communication. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a dream for their son and his new spouse to recreate their trip, but they didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 (the LK) beforehand. The LK clearly stated their discomfort with motorcycles, which is a valid personal preference. The parents then reacted negatively, which seems problematic.\n\nIs the LK in the wrong for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with? Probably not. They have the right to express their preferences, especially in a marriage. The parents, however, overstepped by pressuring and berating the LK. The fianc\u00e9 also didn't consult the LK before buying the motorcycle, which is a major issue. The parents' reaction was hostile, which is not appropriate. \n\nSo the LK isn't in the wrong for declining. They were polite and direct. The problem lies with the fianc\u00e9 and parents for not respecting the LK's wishes. The answer should be B (No).\n"
