It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip honeymoon. The author is getting a motorcycle as a gift, but they don't ride motorcycles and are scared of them. The in-laws are pressuring them, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author. The author politely declined, but the in-laws reacted negatively, even screaming and calling them ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is about respecting personal boundaries and choices in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a specific dream, but the author isn't interested. The fianc\u00e9 didn't discuss it with the author, which is a red flag. Gifts, especially expensive ones, should be given with consideration of the recipient's preferences. The parents' reaction was extreme, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and interests.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's right to have their own preferences is important. Marriage involves making compromises, but not at the expense of one's safety or comfort. Motorcycles can be dangerous, and fear isn't something to be forced into. The parents' insistence without considering the author's feelings is problematic. The fianc\u00e9's failure to consult is also a mistake in the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author could have discussed it earlier to find a middle ground. But given the context\u2014engaged, presented with the gift without prior discussion\u2014it's more about the in-laws overstepping and the author standing their ground. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They have every right to refuse something that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's a significant and unexpected expense.\n"
