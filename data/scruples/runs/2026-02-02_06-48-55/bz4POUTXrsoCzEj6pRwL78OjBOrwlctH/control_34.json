It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon, but the author has no interest in it. The parents and fianc\u00e9 gave them a motorcycle without consulting the author, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is engaged and about to get married. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a motorcycle dealership and took a road trip on motorcycles for their honeymoon. The mother-in-law wants the couple to do the same. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author and presented the motorcycle as a gift. The author is scared of motorcycles and has no interest, so they politely declined. The parents reacted negatively, even screaming, and the author is upset.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider aspects of consent, communication, and respect in relationships. In a marriage, especially when planning a honeymoon, both partners should have a say. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with the author before committing to the trip, which shows a lack of communication. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially since the author gave a polite refusal.\n\nThe author's right to express their preferences is important. Forcing someone into an activity they fear and dislike, especially a significant trip that costs a lot, is not respecting their autonomy. The parents' spending a large sum without considering the recipient's wishes could be seen as overstepping. The fianc\u00e9's role here is also questionable for not advocating for the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement in relationships. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The parents and fianc\u00e9 should have discussed the idea with the author first. The author's refusal, though polite, was met with hostility, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the others are not respecting their boundaries.\n"
