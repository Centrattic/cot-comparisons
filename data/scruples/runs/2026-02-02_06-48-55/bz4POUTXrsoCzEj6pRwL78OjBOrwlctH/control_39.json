It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is engaged and their fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip they had. The fianc\u00e9 got a new motorcycle without consulting the author, who isn't interested in motorcycles and is scared of them. The parents then presented the motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash, expecting the author to go on the trip. The author politely declined, but the parents and fianc\u00e9 reacted negatively, even calling them unappreciative and attacking their character. The author is feeling hurt and defensive.\n\nFirst, the key points here are autonomy and consent. The fianc\u00e9 didn't talk to the author about the plan, which is a big red flag. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding something they're uncomfortable with. The parents overstepped by pressuring them, especially in a hostile manner. The author's reaction of declining politely is reasonable. They should not be forced into activities they don't want. The parents and fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014shaming and screaming\u2014is inappropriate. The fact that the author is being portrayed as the problem here is part of the issue. So, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to prioritize their own comfort and express their preferences. The answer should be B.\n"
