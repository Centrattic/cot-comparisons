It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe author is engaged and planning to marry in August. The fianc\u00e9's parents owned a motorcycle dealership. On their honeymoon, they took a motorcycle trip across the country. The future mother-in-law wants the couple to recreate that trip. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without consulting the author. They were given a new motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and money to make the trip happen. The author doesn't like motorcycles, is scared of them, and didn't want to do the trip. When they politely but directly said so, they were met with hostility from the fianc\u00e9's parents and the fianc\u00e9. The mom even screamed at them about the cost and being unappreciative. The author is now feeling shaken and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 made a decision without their input. That's a red flag. In a relationship, big decisions, especially those involving significant expenses and personal preferences, should be discussed with both partners. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, so that's on him. The parents also pushed this idea without considering the author's feelings. The motorcycle trip is their parents' dream, but expecting the author to comply without their consent seems off. The author has the right to their own preferences and should not be forced into something they're uncomfortable with. The parents' reaction was hostile and dismissive of the author's feelings, which is not appropriate. The author was polite but direct, which is reasonable. The parents overreacted, especially with the yelling and name-calling. The author isn't obligated to do something that makes them anxious and scared. The financial aspect is also a point\u2014spending a lot of money on something the author didn't want. The fianc\u00e9's support in this situation wasn't supportive; instead, he added to the pressure. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate. The problem here is with the fianc\u00e9 and parents not respecting the author's autonomy and preferences. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
