It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (AITA) is the asshole here. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip, but the author doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents have a history with motorcycles. They gave a motorcycle as a gift, but the author isn't interested in riding and is scared. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author before buying the motorcycle, and the parents reacted strongly when the author declined. The author feels pressured and upset because they were criticized for not wanting to do the trip.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's autonomy in their relationship, the fianc\u00e9's decision-making without consulting the author, the parents' reaction, and the author's lack of interest in motorcycles. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's think about it. \n\nThe author is not obligated to follow the in-laws' wishes. It's their choice to make, and the fact that they communicated their disinterest politely but directly suggests they're handling it respectfully. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting them, which might be a red flag. The parents' reaction seems over the top, especially the mother screaming and implying the author is ungrateful. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual respect for each other's preferences. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're standing up for their own desires. The parents and fianc\u00e9 didn't consider their feelings, which led to the conflict. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No) because the author is asserting their own wishes and it's their right to do so. The pressure from the in-laws and fianc\u00e9 isn't justified. The author isn't rejecting the gift for no reason; they have valid reasons based on fear and lack of interest. \n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong here. They're standing up for themselves, and the other parties are the ones being inconsiderate by not respecting their wishes.\n"
