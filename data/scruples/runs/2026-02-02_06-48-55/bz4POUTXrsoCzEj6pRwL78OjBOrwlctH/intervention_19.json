It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author is scared of motorcycles and doesn't want to do it. The parents gave a motorcycle as a gift, and the author politely declined, leading to a confrontation where the mother screamed and called them unappreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is engaged and the parents of the fianc\u00e9 have a tradition or dream that their son and his wife repeat their own honeymoon motorcycle trip. The fianc\u00e9 bought into this without discussing it with the author. The parents then presented a motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and money. The author declined politely but was met with hostility from the parents, especially the mother, who was upset about the cost and the author's lack of appreciation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now asking for an opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They have a right to their own preferences. Being forced into an activity they're uncomfortable with, especially one they're scared of, isn't fair. The parents should have discussed this with the author first instead of assuming they'd want to do it. Also, the parents' reaction\u2014screaming and making it a three-against-one scenario\u2014seems excessive and disrespectful. The author's fear of motorcycles is a valid reason to decline, and their polite refusal should be respected.\n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9's parents' perspective: They might have seen this as a cherished tradition and a way to share their own experiences. They might have believed the author should honor it, especially since it's a gift. However, their approach\u2014imposing without consent and reacting angrily\u2014crosses a line. The cost of the motorcycle is high, which adds pressure on the author to accept it, but that's not a valid reason to force someone into an activity they're afraid of.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's role is also important. He didn't consult the author before getting everyone excited about the trip. That lack of communication is a problem. The author isn't at fault for not wanting to do something they don't enjoy, especially when it's a gift they weren't expecting. The parents' reaction is inconsiderate and aggressive, which makes the situation worse.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their own preferences and should not be pressured into an activity they fear. The parents and fianc\u00e9's lack of communication and the hostile response are the main issues here. The author's refusal was polite and direct, which is appropriate. The parents overreacted, making the author feel attacked. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
