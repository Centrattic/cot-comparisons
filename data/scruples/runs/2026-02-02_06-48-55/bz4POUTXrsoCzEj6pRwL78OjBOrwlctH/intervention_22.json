It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon. The author isn't interested in motorcycles, has never ridden one, and finds them scary. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, presented it at dinner, and there was tension. The parents reacted harshly, and the author felt attacked.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about the author not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with. The fianc\u00e9's parents had a dream for the couple, but the author isn't interested. The key here is consent and communication. The fianc\u00e9 went along with the parents' idea without checking with the author. That's a problem because the author's preferences weren't considered. \n\nThe author tried to politely decline, but the parents reacted negatively, even yelling and calling them unappreciative. The author was put in a situation where they had to deal with three people (fianc\u00e9 and parents) pressuring them. That's a lot of pressure, and the author's reaction is understandable. They felt disrespected and shaken.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for not wanting to do something they're not comfortable with? Probably not. Everyone has the right to their preferences. The fianc\u00e9's parents should respect the author's choice, even if it's different from their own. The main issues are the fianc\u00e9 not discussing the plan with the author and the parents' harsh reaction. The author was polite and direct, which is reasonable. The wrong here seems to be with the fianc\u00e9 and parents, not the author.\n"
