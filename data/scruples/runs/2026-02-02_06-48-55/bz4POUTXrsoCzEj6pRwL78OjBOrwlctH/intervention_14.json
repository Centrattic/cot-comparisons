It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e being pressured to recreate her fianc\u00e9's parents' motorcycle trip as a honeymoon. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is engaged and doesn't want to do a motorcycle trip, which is what the fianc\u00e9's parents want. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting her. They presented it at a dinner, and she said no politely. Then the in-laws reacted badly, even the mom screamed, and now the author is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about autonomy and respecting personal preferences. The author isn't interested in motorcycles and is terrified. The fianc\u00e9 didn't check with her, which is a problem. The in-laws are pressuring her, which is also an issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to do something she's uncomfortable with? Probably not. Everyone has the right to express their preferences, especially in planning their own honeymoon. The fianc\u00e9's family pushing their own dream onto them is where the problem lies. The author was polite and direct, which seems reasonable. The in-laws overreacted, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't support her. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong, but from my perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is the pressure from the fianc\u00e9's family and the fianc\u00e9 not respecting her wishes. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
