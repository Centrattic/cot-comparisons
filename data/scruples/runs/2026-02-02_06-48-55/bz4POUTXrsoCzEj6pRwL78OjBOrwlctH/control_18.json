It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is engaged and the fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate their motorcycle honeymoon trip. The author has no interest in motorcycles and is scared of them. The fianc\u00e9 bought a motorcycle without consulting the author. They got a new bike, gear, and cash, and the author was supposed to go on the trip. The author politely declined, but the fianc\u00e9's parents reacted negatively, even screaming. The author is now feeling attacked and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's autonomy is important. They have the right to make their own choices, especially regarding activities they don't want to participate in. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a problem. The parents imposing their dream on the couple without considering the author's feelings is another issue. The author's refusal was polite but direct, which is reasonable. The parents' reaction of screaming and making them feel like a bad person is clearly over the top.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The fianc\u00e9's parents didn't respect the author's preferences. The author isn't the one being unreasonable here. They're standing up for their own desires, which is healthy. The parents and the fianc\u00e9 should have discussed this with the author first. The fact that they didn't shows a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their own needs and boundaries, which is appropriate. The answer should be B (No).\n"
