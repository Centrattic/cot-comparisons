It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate a motorcycle trip as their honeymoon, but the author is scared and doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents, who owned a motorcycle dealership, took a motorcycle trip on their honeymoon. The parents want their son and his wife to do the same. The fianc\u00e9 bought into this without discussing it with the author. They presented a motorcycle, an itinerary, gear, and cash. The author expressed disinterest politely, but then faced backlash from the parents, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's right to make their own choices about the honeymoon is important. Marriage should involve mutual decisions. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a red flag. The parents' reaction was hostile, which is not acceptable. The author was clear but met with hostility. The parents and fianc\u00e9 should have respected the author's preferences.\n\nThe parents' approach seems controlling, and the author isn't at fault here. The pressure to conform to their expectations without considering the author's feelings is problematic. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable; they have valid fears and no interest. The parents' response was excessive and disrespectful.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have every right to express their preferences, and the parents and fianc\u00e9 should have respected that.\n"
