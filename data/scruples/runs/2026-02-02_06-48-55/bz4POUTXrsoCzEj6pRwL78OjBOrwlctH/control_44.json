It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate their motorcycle trip for their honeymoon. The author didn't want to do it, hasn't ridden a motorcycle, and is scared of them. The fianc\u00e9 didn't talk to the author first and just presented a motorcycle for the trip. The parents reacted badly when the author said no, even screaming. The author feels upset and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parents have a dream for their son and his wife to recreate their trip. That's their personal wish, but it's not the author's. The author clearly communicated their lack of interest and fear. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult the author, which is a problem. Then the parents overreacted with yelling and financial pressure. \n\nThe author's refusal seems reasonable because they don't like motorcycles and the trip isn't their preference. It's their own honeymoon, so they have the right to decide how they want to spend it. The parents spending a lot of money and then getting angry when the author refuses might be the real issue here. The author isn't the one who chose the trip without discussion. They just said no when presented with an unexpected plan that they weren't comfortable with. \n\nAlso, the parents' reaction of screaming and putting pressure is toxic. The author is standing up for their own preferences, which is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9 and parents overstepped by not consulting and then reacting negatively. So the answer should be B.\n"
