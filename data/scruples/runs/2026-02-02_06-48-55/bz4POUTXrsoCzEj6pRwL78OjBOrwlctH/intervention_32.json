It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's parents want them to recreate a motorcycle trip similar to their own honeymoon. The parents bought a motorcycle without consulting the author, who isn't interested in motorcycles and finds them scary. The author politely declined, but then faced backlash from the fianc\u00e9 and in-laws, leading to a confrontation where the mother screamed about the money spent and the author felt attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being asked to engage in an activity they don't enjoy and have no interest in. They communicated their feelings politely but directly. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them about the plan, which is a red flag. The parents made a significant financial commitment without the author's input, which seems disrespectful. The author's refusal led to being criticized and screamed at, which is clearly inappropriate.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's parents had their own dream, but imposing it on the author without considering their preferences is problematic. The author's right to make their own choices about how they spend their time and money, especially for their own honeymoon, should be respected. The fact that the author was given a motorcycle and gear without their consent further shows a lack of respect. The parents' reaction of screaming and 3 vs 1 dynamic suggests they weren't open to the author's perspective, which is not healthy.\n\nSo, the author isn't at fault here. They expressed their feelings politely, and the in-laws overstepped by forcing the issue and reacting aggressively. The fianc\u00e9 also didn't support the author but instead went along with the parents, which is part of the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
