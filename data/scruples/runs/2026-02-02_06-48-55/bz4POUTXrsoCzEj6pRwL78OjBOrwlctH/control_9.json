It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's parents wanted them to recreate their motorcycle trip, but the author isn't interested. They received a motorcycle without being consulted, and there was conflict when they refused.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without talking to the author. The parents presented the motorcycle and itinerary without the author's input. The author expressed their disinterest politely but was met with hostility. The parents accused them of ruining dreams and being ungrateful. \n\nThe main issues here are autonomy and respect. The author has the right to make their own choices about how they want to spend their time and money. The parents and fianc\u00e9 didn't consult them, which is a problem. The author's response was to politely decline, which is reasonable. The parents' reaction\u2014hostility and screaming\u2014seems excessive and unfair. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't do anything wrong by expressing their preferences. The real issue is the pressure from the in-laws and the fianc\u00e9 not considering the author's feelings. The author isn't obligated to participate in something they don't want to do, especially when it's a significant expense and personal choice. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for their own preferences, which is valid. The pressure from the family is the problem here.\n"
