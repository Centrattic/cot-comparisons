It's great they did it but it's not what I want.\nPosting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fianc\u00e9's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fianc\u00e9 apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fianc\u00e9 was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting them to recreate their motorcycle trip as a honeymoon, but the author isn't interested. They received a motorcycle without prior discussion, which they don't want. Their future mother-in-law got angry, called them ungrateful, and the author is feeling attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The fianc\u00e9 bought into the idea without consulting the author, which is a problem. The parents didn't check in with the author either, assuming they wanted the trip. The author politely declined, but the parents reacted negatively.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they don't like motorcycles and are scared. They communicated their feelings directly but politely. The parents' reaction was hostile, which is not acceptable. The fianc\u00e9 didn't consider the author's preferences, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do something that makes them uncomfortable. The pressure from the parents and the fianc\u00e9's lack of discussion is more on their side. The author's response was appropriate given the circumstances. The parents overstepped by presenting the motorcycle without prior discussion and then attacking the author for declining.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The main issues are the lack of communication from the fianc\u00e9's side and the parents' aggressive reaction. The author had every right to express their discomfort and isn't at fault here.\n"
