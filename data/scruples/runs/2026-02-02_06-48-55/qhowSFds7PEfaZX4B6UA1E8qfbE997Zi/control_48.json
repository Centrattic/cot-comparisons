For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dog is 16 years old and has multiple health issues, including blindness and deafness. The owners have decided it's time to euthanize her to prevent further suffering. The key point here is making the decision to end the dog's suffering, which is a compassionate choice.\n\nThe author mentions that they and their wife don't want to be present during the procedure. They acknowledge that they're kind to the dog but don't have that intense bond many people describe with their pets. They also note financial concerns because being present might cost more. They do say they'd take her to a reputable place regardless.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're the asshole (A) or not (B). The author is worried about being judged. So, is their decision to not be present wrong?\n\nI think the key factors are the dog's well-being and the owners' emotional readiness. The owners have already made the compassionate choice to end the dog's suffering. Choosing not to be present doesn't negate that compassion. People have different emotional capacities and relationships with their pets. Just because others might prefer being there doesn't make it wrong for them to choose otherwise. The dog is in a reputable facility, so the procedure is still handled properly. The financial aspect is a practical concern but doesn't affect the ethical decision here.\n\nSome might argue that being present is a more loving act, but if the owners can't emotionally handle it, forcing themselves could lead to unnecessary stress for them. The priority is the dog's comfort and the owners' ability to cope. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough decision based on their specific circumstances and emotional needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
