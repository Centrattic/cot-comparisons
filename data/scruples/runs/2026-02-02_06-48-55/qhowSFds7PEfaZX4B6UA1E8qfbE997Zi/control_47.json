For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The wife is the legal owner, and neither spouse wants to hold the dog or be there during the procedure. They mention that they're kind to the dog but don't have that intense bond others might have. They also note the higher cost of being present and that they'd still use a reputable place regardless.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether they're the asshole (A) or not (B). First, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Euthanizing a pet is a tough decision, especially when the pet is suffering. The couple has made the humane choice to end the dog's suffering, which is the right thing to do. Now, the part in question is their decision not to be present during the procedure.\n\nMany people believe that being present allows the pet to feel comforted, but others might find it too emotionally taxing. The author mentions they don't have that deep bond with the dog as they have with previous ones. So maybe they feel it's not their place or that they can't handle it emotionally. \n\nThe cost factor is another point. If being present costs more, but they're still ensuring a reputable service, maybe they're trying to make the best decision under the circumstances. The wife, being the owner, might have the final say, but both are in agreement. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to be there? Some might argue that being present is a final act of love, but others might see it as a personal choice. The couple is making sure the dog is euthanized properly, so their intention is good. They might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the decision is made out of compassion for the dog's suffering. Not being present doesn't negate their care for the dog. People have different ways of coping, and forcing themselves into a situation they're not comfortable with might not be the best for them. So, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
