While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners have decided euthanasia is the kindest option. The wife, who technically owns the dog, and the author don't want to be present during the procedure. They feel they don't have that strong bond with the dog compared to their previous pets. They're concerned about being judged and mention the higher cost of a facility where they can be present. The core issue is whether they're being cruel or selfish by not accompanying the dog in its final moments.\n\nNow, I should consider different perspectives. On one hand, many people believe that being present is a way to show love and provide comfort. It's a personal choice, but some might see not being there as not giving the dog the dignity it deserves. Others might argue that the owners' emotional state is valid. If holding the dog would cause them additional trauma, maybe it's okay. But the author isn't holding the dog at all, just not being present. \n\nThe cost factor is mentioned. Maybe they can't afford the more expensive option where they can be there. But they said they would use a reputable place regardless. So it's not about the dog's care but their own comfort. \n\nThe key points here are the owners' relationship with the dog. They mention not having the intense bond others have. If they don't have that emotional connection, maybe it's not fair to expect them to be there. But again, some people might argue that as owners, they should be there regardless. \n\nJudgment often comes into play here. The author feels judged, but is there a moral obligation? In many cases, people have varying levels of attachment. If the owners have made a compassionate decision to end suffering, the method of euthanasia might be less about their presence and more about the act itself. \n\nAlso, the dog might not even recognize them due to being blind and deaf, so holding them might not matter. But that's speculative. The main thing is the owners' intent. They are trying to prevent suffering, which is a good motive. Their personal feelings about being present might be valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If being present is a personal choice and not a moral duty, then B (not in the wrong) makes sense. But if society expects owners to be there, then A. But I think it's a personal choice. The answer hinges on whether there's a universal right or wrong here. Since people have different relationships with their pets, the decision to be present or not should be respected. Hence, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
