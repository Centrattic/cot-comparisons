While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner feels guilty that they don't want to hold the dog or be there during the process.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The dog is suffering, and the decision to euthanize is made to prevent further suffering. The owners are taking the dog to a reputable place, so the process will be humane. The key points here are the dog's well-being and the owners' emotional state.\n\nThe author mentions that neither they nor their wife have the deep bond with this dog as they did with previous ones. The wife was the original owner, but even she doesn't feel the need to be present. They\u2019re worried about societal judgment but don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nIs it wrong to not be present? Well, euthanasia is a compassionate choice to end suffering. The act itself isn't cruel, especially if done by a professional. The owners are making a difficult decision for the dog's benefit. Their personal reasons for not wanting to be there\u2014like emotional distress\u2014might be valid. People handle grief differently. Some might find comfort in being present, others might find it too painful. There's no one-size-fits-all here.\n\nAlso, the cost difference for being present is a factor. They mention they would go to a reputable place regardless, so the dog's welfare isn't compromised. The question is about judgment. Society often expects emotional presence, but it's important to recognize that not everyone can or wants to do that. The decision is still in the dog's best interest, not driven by neglect or cruelty.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because their decision is based on the dog's well-being and their own emotional needs. They\u2019re not being cruel or neglectful. The answer should be B (No).\n"
