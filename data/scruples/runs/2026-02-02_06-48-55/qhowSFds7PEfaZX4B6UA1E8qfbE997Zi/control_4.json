For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their 16-year-old dog during euthanasia. The dog is blind and deaf with various health issues. The couple doesn't want to be present, even though they're taking it to a reputable place. The wife is the official owner, but both are okay with not being there. They mention feeling judged if they don't do it, but they don't have the same intense bond as others might. The question is whether they're acting wrongly by not being there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dog's quality of life is poor, and euthanasia is to prevent suffering. The owners have made a responsible decision to end the dog's suffering. The debate is around their presence during the procedure. \n\nDifferent people have different coping mechanisms. Some find comfort in being present, others find it too emotional. The key points are that they are making a responsible choice by ending the dog's suffering, and they\u2019re not neglecting the dog. The cost difference isn't mentioned as a financial issue, just a preference for a less expensive option. \n\nIn terms of judgment, others might have different opinions, but being present isn't a requirement for a loving owner. The bond between the owners and the dog might not be as strong as others, which is a valid reason. The main factors are the dog's well-being and the owners' emotional state. \n\nI don't see any wrongdoing here. The authors are making a humane decision and have their reasons for not being present. Others might judge, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
