She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. The dog has multiple issues like blindness and deafness, and the owners have decided it's time for euthanasia to prevent suffering. The main point is whether not being there makes them bad people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dog's owner is the wife, and they both don't want to be present. They mention that they are kind to the dog but don't have that intense bond that others might. They also note that there's a higher cost to be present, but they'd still take the dog to a reputable place regardless.\n\nThe person is worried about being judged if they don't hold the dog during the process. The question is if they're the asshole here.\n\nI should think about different perspectives. On one hand, many people do choose to be with their pets during euthanasia because it's a final moment of comfort. It's often seen as a way to provide love and closure. On the other hand, not everyone form a deep bond with their pets. Maybe they tried but couldn't connect as much, especially with this dog. Also, the decision is based on the dog's best interest, not neglect. The cost is higher if they want to be present, but they're still ensuring the process is done properly. \n\nIs there any cruelty or neglect here? The dog is being euthanized to prevent suffering, which is a responsible decision. The owners aren't avoiding the process entirely; they just prefer not to be present. Some people might judge them, but others would understand that it's a personal choice based on their relationship with the dog.\n\nI should also consider cultural or personal norms. In some cultures, being present is expected, but others might see it as a personal choice. The key here is that the decision is made for the dog's well-being, not because they don't care. They mentioned being kind, so their intentions are good.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a compassionate decision for the dog and are not actively harming it. Not being present doesn't equate to being an asshole if it's based on their personal relationship with the pet and practical considerations.\n"
