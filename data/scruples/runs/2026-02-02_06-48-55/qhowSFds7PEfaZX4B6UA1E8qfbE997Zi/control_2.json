Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: their dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has multiple health issues. They've decided it's time to euthanize her to prevent suffering. The wife is the legal owner since she had the dog before they were married. Neither the author nor his wife wants to be present during the procedure. They feel they don't have that deep bond with the dog as many people do, though the author mentions he had strong bonds with previous dogs. The main question is about judgment\u2014whether they're the asshole for not being there.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the bond they have with the dog and their emotional readiness. They're making a decision based on their feelings and circumstances. The cost of being present is higher, but they\u2019ll still use a reputable facility. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, many people do choose to be with their pets during euthanasia, but it's not a universal expectation. The decision to not be there might be influenced by their personal relationship with the dog. They might feel it's more respectful or less traumatic for them not to be present. The fact that they're making a decision to end suffering shows they care about the dog's well-being. \n\nHowever, others might argue that being there is a final gesture of love and respect. But the post indicates that they don't share that deep bond, so forcing themselves to be there might be more about others' expectations than their own feelings. It's also important that they're making a responsible decision by going to a reputable place.\n\nIn terms of judgment, the answer hinges on whether not being present is inherently wrong. Since their intentions are to prevent suffering and they have their reasons, it's not necessarily the case that they're wrong. The decision is personal and based on their unique situation. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
