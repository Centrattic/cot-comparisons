For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're the \"asshole\" for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is very old, blind, deaf, and has multiple health issues. The couple doesn't feel a strong emotional bond with the dog, even though the wife was the original owner. They're concerned about being judged and also mention the cost difference for being present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanasia is meant to prevent suffering, and the decision is already made to end the dog's life to avoid further pain. The couple is taking the dog to a reputable place, which is responsible. The question is about their presence during the procedure.\n\nSome people believe that being present shows love and respect, but others argue that the absence doesn't negate the care given. The key points here are the dog's welfare and the owners' emotional state. If being there would cause them significant distress, maybe it's better for them not to be there. The main priority is the dog's comfort, which they are ensuring by getting the procedure done properly.\n\nAlso, the emotional connection varies. The user mentions they don't have that intense bond, which is personal and doesn't make them bad. People grieve differently. The judgment they fear might be based on societal expectations, but the rightness of the action is more about the decision to euthanize for the dog's well-being, not their presence during the procedure.\n\nCost is another factor, but they said they'd still choose a reputable place regardless. So the primary motivation isn't financial\u2014it's about their emotional readiness. \n\nIn conclusion, the decision not to be present doesn't make them the \"asshole.\" They're prioritizing the dog's comfort and their own emotional well-being, which is a valid approach given the circumstances.\n"
