She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their wife don't want to hold the dog or be in the room during the procedure. They mention that the wife is the actual owner since she had the dog before they were married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect here. Many people feel that being present for their pet's euthanasia is important to provide comfort and closure. However, the author admits that their relationship with the dog isn't as intense as others might have, which could affect their decision. They also mention the higher cost of being present, but they'd take her to a reputable place regardless. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The key factors are the dog's well-being and the owners' emotional state. Since the decision is made to end the dog's suffering, the priority is to ensure the process is humane. If the owners are emotionally unable to be present and it doesn't compromise the dog's care, maybe it's not their fault. However, some might argue that being there is a responsible choice, even if it's difficult. \n\nBut the author isn't avoiding responsibility; they're making a decision based on their emotional capacity. The dog is being taken to a reputable place, so the care isn't compromised. The judgment here is about whether the choice to not be present makes them an asshole. If the dog's welfare is prioritized, then maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because they're making a decision based on their emotional state and the dog's best interest, not neglecting it. However, societal judgment is part of the question. The author feels judged, but the actual rightness of their action depends on the dog's welfare and their own mental health. Since they're not causing harm to the dog, maybe they aren't in the wrong.\n"
