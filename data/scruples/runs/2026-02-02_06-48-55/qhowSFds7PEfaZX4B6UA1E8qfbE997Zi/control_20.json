For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is the asshole for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple doesn't have the same intense bond with this dog as with previous ones. They don't want to hold her or be in the room, and they mention the cost difference if they want to be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The decision is based on the dog's well-being, which is the primary concern. They're not neglecting the dog, just not wanting to be there. People have different coping mechanisms and emotional responses. Some might find it too distressing, while others feel it's important. The key points are that they're acting in the dog's best interest and ensuring it's done at a reputable place. They also mention feeling judged, which is a common issue in these situations.\n\nThe question is about whether their choice makes them the asshole. The term \"asshole\" here implies being inconsiderate or wrong. Since their intention is to prevent suffering and they're making a responsible decision, it's more about personal feelings rather than right or wrong. They are not harming the dog; they're just choosing a different way to handle the emotional aspect. Others might judge, but that doesn't make them wrong. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
