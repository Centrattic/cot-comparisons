For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they don't hold their 16-year-old dog during euthanasia. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple doesn't want to be present, partly because they feel they don't have that intense bond with the dog compared to others. They also mention the cost difference if they choose a place where they can be there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanizing a pet is a tough decision, especially when it's for the animal's well-being. The couple's main reasons are emotional readiness and practical reasons like cost. It's important to note that they're still taking the dog to a reputable place, so the animal's welfare isn't compromised. \n\nSociety often expects owners to be present during euthanasia as a sign of love and respect. But the writer isn't doing that. However, the question is whether they're wrong. The key points are the dog's suffering, the owners' emotional state, and societal judgment.\n\nThe dog's quality of life is a priority here. If the couple has decided that euthanasia is the kindest option, that's responsible. Not being present doesn't make it cruel; they're not causing suffering. Their reasoning about the bond might be a factor. If they don't feel a strong connection, it's natural they might not want to be there. It's their choice, even if others judge them.\n\nAlso, the cost issue is practical. Choosing a less expensive option doesn't harm the dog. The main thing is that the process is handled humanely. So, while some might judge them for not being there, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They've made a decision that's in the dog's best interest, even if it's not the emotionally challenging one they feel pressured to take.\n"
