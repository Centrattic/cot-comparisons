For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their 16-year-old dog during euthanasia. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The author and their wife don't want to be present during the procedure. They mention that the dog was originally the wife's, and they're both emotionally attached but not in that intense way others might have. They also note that there's a higher cost if they go to a place where they can be present, but they'd still use a reputable service.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the emotional aspect. People often form strong bonds with their pets, and being present during euthanasia is a personal choice. Some find comfort in being there, others find it too painful. The author and their wife don't feel that intense connection, so maybe they're making a decision based on their emotional needs. \n\nThen there's the cost factor. They mention that being present is more expensive. If they can't afford it, maybe it's a practical decision. However, they do say they'd take the dog somewhere reputable regardless, so cost isn't the main issue here, just that they don't want to be there.\n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Society often expects people to be present, but that's a judgment. The author is aware of potential judgment but is choosing not to comply. The key points are their reasons: emotional detachment from the dog, not wanting to endure the moment, and the cost. \n\nIs it wrong to not be there? Well, every person's relationship with their pet is different. If they've made this decision out of their own emotional well-being and the dog's best interest, maybe they're not in the wrong. They still care for the dog, just in a different way. \n\nAlso, the dog's comfort is important. The vet would ensure the process is peaceful. The owners might feel that being there isn't necessary for the dog's experience since the dog is blind and deaf. The dog might not even realize they're there. So maybe the decision is more about the owners' emotional state than the dog's.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their personal feelings and circumstances, and they're still ensuring the dog is treated with care.\n"
