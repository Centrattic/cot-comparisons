For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong if they don't hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their spouse don't want to be present, maybe because they don't feel that strong a bond anymore. They mention that they don't want to be judged and are considering the cost difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Euthanasia is a tough decision, especially for a long-time pet. The owners are making a humane choice to end the dog's suffering, which is generally seen as the right thing. The question is about being present during the procedure. \n\nSome people believe that being there shows respect and provides closure, but others might feel it's too painful. The author's reasoning is that they don't have that intense bond anymore, which is a personal feeling. They also mention cost as a factor, which adds another layer. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. Different people have different emotional needs. The key is that they're making a decision that's best for the dog's welfare, even if they choose not to be present. They\u2019re still going to a reputable place, so the procedure is safe. \n\nAlso, the judgment part is important. The author is worried about being judged for their choice. But it's their personal decision based on their feelings. Unless they're harming the dog, their personal choice shouldn't make them an asshole. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), they're not in the wrong. They're prioritizing the dog's comfort and their own emotional state. The main thing is that the dog is treated humanely, which they are. The answer should be B.\n"
