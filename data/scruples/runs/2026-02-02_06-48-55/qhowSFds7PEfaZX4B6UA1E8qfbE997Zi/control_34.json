She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia.\n\nFirst, the dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners have decided it's time to euthanize to prevent suffering. Both the author and their wife don't want to be there, either holding the dog or being in the same room. They mention that the wife is the legal owner, and they don't feel that strong bond that others might. They're concerned about societal judgment and the higher cost of being present. They would take the dog somewhere reputable regardless.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The primary goal here is the dog's well-being. The decision to euthanize is made with the dog's best interest in mind. The owners are not avoiding responsibility; they're choosing a humane option. Not being present doesn't affect the dog's comfort during the procedure. The cost aspect is also a practical consideration, but they still plan to use a reputable service. There's no indication that they're being cruel or neglectful. The emotional aspect is also valid; some people might find being present too traumatic, especially if they don't have a deep bond. Society often expects people to be there, but personal feelings and emotional capacity should be respected. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" there's no malicious intent. They're making a compassionate decision for the dog, just not involving themselves physically during the process. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
