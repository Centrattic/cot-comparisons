She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dog is 16, has multiple health issues, and the owners have decided it's time for euthanasia. The question is about whether they should hold the dog or be there during the procedure. The author is worried about being judged if they don't do it, even though they don't have as close a bond with the dog as others might. They also mention a cost difference for being present and that they'll go to a reputable place regardless.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the owners' emotional readiness, the dog's well-being, and societal expectations. Let me break it down. \n\nThe primary responsibility is to the dog's welfare. If the owners have made a humane decision to euthanize due to suffering, that's the right call. Whether they are present during the procedure is more about their own emotional comfort. The author mentions they don't have that intense bond with the dog. Forcing themselves to be there could lead to their own trauma, which might not be fair. \n\nHowever, some people believe that being present allows for a more dignified end and provides closure. But the author isn't in denial; they're being honest about their feelings. It's also mentioned that the vet will handle it professionally either way. \n\nThe judgment part is tricky. Society often expects people to be there, but it's important to recognize that grief and bonding vary. The owners are still making a compassionate choice. So, is the author in the wrong for not being present? I think not. Their decision is based on their relationship with the dog and their own emotional state. They aren't harming the dog by not being there. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
