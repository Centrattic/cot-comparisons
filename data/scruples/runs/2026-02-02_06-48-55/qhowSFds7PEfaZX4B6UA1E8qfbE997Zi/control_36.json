For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. The dog has multiple health issues, and the owners feel it's the right decision. They mention that neither they nor their wife, who is the primary owner, want to be there. They also note that there's a cost difference for being present, but they'd still go to a reputable place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The decision to euthanize is based on the dog's quality of life, which is a responsible act. The owners are prioritizing the dog's comfort and avoiding suffering. The question is about their emotional readiness to be present, which is a personal choice. Some people find it comforting to be there, while others find it too distressing. The fact that they're not close in the same way as with previous dogs adds context. They're not avoiding responsibility; they're making a tough decision for the pet's well-being.\n\nJudgment often comes from others' expectations, but the rightness of the decision depends on the owners' relationship with the pet and their emotional state. Since they're ensuring a reputable place, the dog's treatment isn't compromised. The cost issue is mentioned, but they emphasize that they wouldn't skimp on care. So, the core issue is emotional presence versus doing what's best for the dog. The answer likely leans towards not being in the wrong because the decision is based on the dog's welfare, not neglect.\n"
