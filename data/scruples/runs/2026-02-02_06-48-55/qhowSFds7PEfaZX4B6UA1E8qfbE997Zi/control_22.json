While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple decided it's time to euthanize to prevent suffering. They don't want to be there, either holding the dog or in the same room. They mention that the wife is the actual owner, and they both don't have that intense bond they see in others, though the husband had that with previous dogs. They also note the cost is higher if they go somewhere they can be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Euthanasia is a difficult decision, often made out of love to stop suffering. The couple has already made the decision to euthanize, which is compassionate. The issue is about being present during the procedure. Some people believe that being there provides comfort to the pet and closure for the owner. Others might find it too emotionally taxing, especially if they don't feel that strong a bond. The writer mentions they are kind to the dog but don't have that intense relationship. So maybe they aren't avoiding it out of cruelty but because of their emotional state or lack of bond.\n\nAnother angle is the cost. They mention higher costs for being present. If they can't afford it, maybe that's a practical consideration. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally, not financially. But the cost might be a red herring here. The main point is their emotional readiness and bond with the dog.\n\nAlso, the wife is the owner, so maybe the husband's role is less central. But the question is about both of them not wanting to be there. The key factors are intent\u2014both are acting out of care for the dog's welfare by not prolonging suffering. Their decision not to be present isn't causing additional harm; they're just not present. The judgment comes from others, but the question is whether they are actually wrong.\n\nIn many cases, people have different ways of coping. Some need to be there, others can't bear it. The fact that they are taking the dog to a reputable place shows they care about the process. Since their motivation isn't cruelty but personal emotional limits, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that being present is a responsible choice to ensure everything is done correctly. But the writer states they would take her to a reputable place regardless, so that's covered.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They made a compassionate decision, are not causing harm, and their reasons are personal and not malicious. Others may judge, but that doesn't make them wrong.\n"
