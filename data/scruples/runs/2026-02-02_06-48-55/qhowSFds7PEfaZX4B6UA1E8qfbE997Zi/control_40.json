For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the dog is 16 years old with multiple health issues, and the decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering. Both the author and his wife don't feel the intense bond many people have with their pets, even though the author had that bond with previous dogs. They don't want to be present during the procedure and are considering a higher-cost option if they need to be there. They mention they'll take the dog to a reputable place regardless.\n\nNow, the question is about whether they're wrong for not accompanying the dog. The key points to consider are their reasons and the context. The decision is based on the dog's quality of life, not neglect. They're responsible pet owners by choosing a reputable facility. The emotional aspect is also a factor\u2014they're not avoiding the decision but making a choice that's best for them emotionally. The cost difference is a practical consideration, but they're not cutting corners on the procedure's quality.\n\nSociety often expects people to be present during euthanasia, but that's not a universal rule. The owners are making a personal choice that they feel is right for their situation. There's no evidence of them being cruel or neglectful. The wife is the legal owner, so the decision isn't forced on her. The author is reflecting on possible judgment but isn't harming the dog.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), as their decision is based on their relationship with the dog and emotional needs, not malice. They\u2019re prioritizing the dog\u2019s well-being by ending suffering and handling their own emotional response appropriately.\n"
