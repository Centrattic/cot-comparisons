For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues, so the decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering. The couple doesn't want to hold the dog or be in the room, and they're concerned about judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. The primary concern is the dog's well-being. The couple has already decided against letting the dog suffer, which is a compassionate choice. The next point is whether being present is necessary for the dog's comfort. Some people believe that being with their pet provides comfort, but others argue that the presence of the owner might cause stress if they're visibly upset. Also, the dog is blind and deaf, so it might not even notice if the owners aren't there. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect for the owners. Not wanting to be present could be due to emotional distress or past experiences. It's important to respect their feelings and the fact that their bond with the dog might not be as intense as others' experiences. The cost factor is another practical issue; they're still going to a reputable place, so the care is assured regardless of their presence. \n\nSociety often expects people to be with their pets during euthanasia, but that doesn't mean it's right for everyone. The key here is the owners' good intentions and the dog's best interest. Since they're making a humane decision and handling the logistics responsibly, their choice not to be present is their personal right. They shouldn't be judged harshly for that, as long as they've considered all factors and the dog's welfare is the priority. \n\nSo the answer is B, they are not in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are acting in the dog's best interest, even if their choice differs from societal expectations.\n"
