For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the WIBTA post is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple doesn't want to be present during the procedure, and they mention feeling judged if they don't. The question is whether they're the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dog's quality of life is poor, and the decision to euthanize is to prevent suffering. The owners are making a responsible choice. They don't want to be present, which is their personal choice. Society often expects being there for the pet's final moments, but that's a cultural norm, not a moral obligation. The couple is still ensuring the dog is taken to a reputable place, so the dog's comfort is prioritized.\n\nThey mention that they're both the dog's owner (wife originally) and that they have a kind relationship but not the intense bond others might have. Their reasons for not being present are personal and valid. People might judge them, but that doesn't make them wrong. The key here is that the decision is about their emotional well-being and what they can handle. Euthanasia is an act of love, and the method of doing it\u2014whether present or not\u2014doesn't negate that.\n\nHowever, some might argue that being present offers comfort to the pet and closure for the owner. But if the owners are not emotionally prepared to be there, forcing themselves could lead to more distress. The cost difference is another factor, but they\u2019re still choosing a reputable facility, so the care is ensured.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about intention and impact. The owners are acting in the dog's best interest. Avoiding the procedure isn't neglectful. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a personal choice based on their circumstances without harming the pet.\n"
