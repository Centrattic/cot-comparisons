For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16 and has several health issues, so it's time to let it go. The author and their wife don't want to be present during the procedure. They mention that the wife was the original owner, but neither has that deep bond with the dog as others do. They\u2019re worried about being judged and there's a cost difference for being present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The decision is based on the dog's well-being, which is the priority. The couple wants to avoid the emotional distress of being there. They're still taking the dog to a reputable place, so the care is assured. They're not neglecting the dog; they're making a compassionate choice for the pet. \n\nSome people might argue that being present is a more humane choice, but others might say that if the owners can't handle the emotional impact, it's okay to let professionals handle it. The key here is that they're making the decision for the dog's best interest, not out of selfishness. They're also respecting their own emotional limits. \n\nJudging someone for not wanting to be present might be harsh. It's a personal choice and can depend on individual circumstances. The fact that they're not avoiding the situation entirely but are willing to pay for a proper procedure shows they care. The question is about being the \"asshole,\" which usually implies selfishness or cruelty. Since their actions are motivated by compassion for the dog and their own mental health, they\u2019re not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
