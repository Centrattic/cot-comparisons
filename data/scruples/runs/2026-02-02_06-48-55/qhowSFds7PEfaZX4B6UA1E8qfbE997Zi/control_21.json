For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple decided it's time to euthanize to prevent suffering. They don't want to be present because they don't have that intense bond with the dog, even though the wife had the dog before they married. They also mention not wanting to be judged and the higher cost of being present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanizing a pet is a difficult decision, but it's often done out of love and to prevent suffering. The key question is whether not being present makes them wrong. Some people believe that being there provides comfort to the pet and closure for the owner. However, others argue that the decision is already made out of care, and the method of euthanasia (by a vet) is humane regardless of the owner's presence.\n\nThe couple's reasons: they don't have the same bond as others, and they don't want to be in the room. They say they are kind to the dog but just don't have that intense connection. That's their experience, and it's valid. Also, there's the cost factor. Maybe they can't afford the more expensive option where they can be present. But the user is focusing on the moral judgment, not financials.\n\nIs it wrong to not be there? It depends on cultural or personal beliefs, but from a general standpoint, the intent is to end suffering. The couple is making a compassionate choice, even if they aren't physically present. The vet would handle it professionally. The judgment they fear might come from others expecting emotional presence, but their feelings and relationship with the dog are genuine. They might not be able to handle the emotional stress of being there, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B. They're not wrong. Their decision is based on their bond with the pet and personal comfort, and the main goal is to prevent suffering, which is the right thing regardless of presence.\n"
