For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, which is quite old, and has multiple health issues like blindness and deafness. The owner (the wife) and the author don't want to hold the dog or be in the room during the procedure. They mention that they don't have that intense bond with the dog as some people do, even though the author had that bond with previous dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons they're giving. The main points are their emotional readiness and the cost difference. They want to avoid the emotional distress of being present, and the fact that doing it without them being there is less expensive. They also say they'll take the dog to a reputable place regardless.\n\nSociety often expects pet owners to be present during euthanasia, seeing it as a final act of love and support. But this isn't a one-size-fits-all situation. The emotional impact on the owners is significant here. If they're not prepared to face that moment, forcing themselves to do so might cause unnecessary trauma. However, others might argue that being present is a responsible and compassionate choice for the pet.\n\nThe fact that the wife is the official owner adds another layer. Maybe she's the one who should make the decision, but the author is involved in the discussion. They mention not having that intense bond, which could be valid. Not everyone bonds the same way with pets. The cost might also be a practical concern, though it's not clear if the higher cost is prohibitive or just a preference.\n\nUltimately, the key is whether their reasons are valid. They're not neglecting the dog's well-being by choosing a reputable facility. Their reasoning is about their own emotional state, which is a personal choice. While some might judge them, they're making a decision based on their comfort and the dog's condition. So, I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
