For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they don't hold their dog during euthanasia. They mention the dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. Both they and their wife are the dog's owners, but they don't feel that intense bond that some people have with their pets. They don't want to be present and it's more expensive to do it elsewhere. They're worried about being judged but want to avoid that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The dog's quality of life is poor, so euthanasia is a compassionate choice. The owners are making a decision to stop their dog's suffering, which is generally seen as responsible. The issue is about whether they should be present during the procedure.\n\nSome people believe being there allows the owner to say goodbye and feel closure, which can be important for emotional healing. But others may find it too painful, especially if they don't have that strong of a bond. The author mentions that neither they nor their wife feel the intense connection others might. So maybe their decision is based on personal feelings and what's best for them emotionally.\n\nAlso, the cost factor is mentioned. They want to take the dog to a reputable place regardless, but being present is more expensive. If they can't afford the higher cost, that might be a factor. But maybe the cost isn't the main issue; it's more about their emotional readiness.\n\nIs it wrong to not be present? I think it's subjective. There's no universal rule that you must be there. Different people handle grief and sayings of goodbye differently. The main thing is that the decision is made in the dog's best interest, which they are doing. They're ensuring the dog is euthanized humanely, which is the most important aspect. \n\nJudgment from others might come from people who value being present, but the author isn't harming the dog by not being there. Their personal feelings and emotional needs are valid. So, they aren't in the wrong for choosing not to be there if they don't feel the need to be. The key is that the action is in the dog's best interest, not the owner's personal preference. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
