For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they're the \"asshole\" if they don't hold their 16-year-old dog during euthanasia. The dog is old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. They and their wife don't want to be present or hold the dog, which is understandable given their emotional state. They mention the cost is higher for being present, but they'll still use a reputable place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Euthanasia is about ending suffering, which is a responsible decision. The question is about presence during the procedure. Some people find comfort in being with their pet in their final moments, but others can't handle the emotional toll. The writer isn't being neglectful; they're making a personal choice based on their feelings. They\u2019re still ensuring the dog is treated humanely. \n\nJudgment from others might stem from societal expectations, but everyone's relationship with their pet is different. The key points are that they're making a compassionate decision for the dog's well-being and that their absence isn't due to callousness. Their prior dogs had strong bonds, but this situation is different. So, the answer should be B (not wrong) because their choice is based on personal and emotional reasons, not neglect.\n"
