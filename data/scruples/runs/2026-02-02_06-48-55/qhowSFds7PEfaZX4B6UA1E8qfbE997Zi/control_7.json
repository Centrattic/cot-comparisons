She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong if they don't hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other issues. The person and their wife don't want to be present during the procedure. They mention that the wife is the legal owner and that they don't have the intense bond many people do, but they feel judged if they don't do it. They also note that being present might cost more, but they'd use a reputable place regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanizing a pet is a difficult decision, especially when done to prevent suffering. The person's reasoning is based on the dog's quality of life, which is generally seen as responsible. The question is about whether they're wrong for not being present.\n\nSociety often expects people to be present because it's a closure for the owners. But the key here is the emotional state of the owners. If they're not emotionally prepared to be there, forcing themselves might not be healthy. The dog probably wouldn't even notice their absence since it's blind and deaf. So maybe the focus should be on what's best for the owners' mental health in this situation.\n\nFinancial aspects: The higher cost for being present could make it a practical decision. But the main point is their emotional comfort. The fact that they're being kind and responsible by ending the dog's suffering is more important than the method of presence. \n\nJudgment from others is a common concern. People might have different views, but ultimately, the decision should be based on the owners' needs and the dog's welfare. Since the dog is suffering, the owners are acting in its best interest. The lack of an intense bond doesn't make their decision wrong. They're still providing a humane end.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, they aren't in the wrong). They made a tough decision based on the dog's well-being and their own emotional state. Others might prefer to be there, but it's not obligatory. The main factors are the dog's suffering and the owners' mental health. They're not being neglectful or cruel by not holding the dog.\n"
