For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple, who are the dog's owners, both feel they don't have an intense bond with the dog, even though the wife had her before marriage. They don't want to hold her during the procedure or be in the room, and they mention the cost difference if they were to be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the primary factors. The dog's well-being is the main concern here. The owners have decided it's time for euthanasia to prevent suffering, which is a responsible decision. The question is about their emotional involvement during the procedure. \n\nSome people find comfort in being present for their pets at the end, but others find it too emotionally difficult. The author and their wife are honest about their feelings towards the dog\u2014no intense bond. That part is important because it shows they're being truthful about their relationship with the pet. \n\nThe cost issue might be a red herring, but it's mentioned as a factor. However, the key point is their emotional readiness. There's no legal obligation to be present, and the procedure will still be done humanely regardless. \n\nJudgment-wise, people might have varying opinions. Some might think it's a personal choice, others might feel it's wrong. But from an ethical standpoint, the decision isn't about the owners' feelings but the animal's welfare. Since they're ensuring the dog's comfort and not prolonging suffering, their decision not to be present doesn't make them the \"asshole.\" \n\nAlso, the fact that they're consulting about judgment suggests they care about doing the right thing for the dog, even if they don't want to be there emotionally. So, their choice is based on their emotional state, not the dog's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
