For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The author and their wife don't feel a strong bond with the dog anymore and don't want to be there. They're concerned about being judged if they don't hold the dog during the process.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Euthanasia is a serious decision, and people have different ways of coping with it. Some people find comfort in being with their pet at the end, while others might find it too painful. The key points here are that they've decided it's in the dog's best interest to end her suffering, they're taking her to a reputable place, and they're not neglecting her care otherwise.\n\nThe question is whether not being present makes them \"the asshole.\" The judgment here depends on cultural or societal expectations, but the main thing is the dog's well-being. The authors have already made the compassionate decision to euthanize to prevent suffering. Their personal choice about being present doesn't impact the dog's experience. Others might prefer to be there, but that doesn't make the authors wrong for choosing otherwise. It's their emotional response and coping mechanism. Also, the cost consideration might be a factor, but they're still ensuring quality care. So, the answer is B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
