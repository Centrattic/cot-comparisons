For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners don't want to hold her or be in the room during the procedure, partly because they don't have that close of a bond with her as they did with previous dogs. They mention that there's a higher cost if they want to be present, but they'd take her to a reputable place regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanizing a pet is a tough decision, and the owners have already decided it's the best option to prevent suffering. The main issue here is whether not being present makes them wrong. Different people have different emotional connections with their pets. The wife is the original owner, but even she doesn't feel the intense bond. Maybe the dog wasn't as close, which isn't unusual. \n\nSociety often expects people to be present during euthanasia as a sign of compassion and closure. But the question is whether that expectation is valid. If the owners are making a humane decision and are kind to the dog otherwise, is their choice to not be there wrong? Also, cost is a factor mentioned, but they're not cutting corners on care, just choosing a more affordable option where they don't have to be present. \n\nI think the key points are: the owners are acting in the dog's best interest, they're not neglecting her, and they're making a difficult decision. Their emotional connection might not be as strong as others', which is a personal matter. Being judged for that seems harsh. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because their intentions are good, and personal feelings about bonding shouldn't make them wrong if they're providing proper care and a humane end.\n"
