For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present when their dog is euthanized. The author's dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. They mention that they don't want to hold the dog or be in the same room during the procedure. The wife, who is the actual owner, also doesn't want to be there. They feel there's societal judgment for not doing this, and there's a higher cost if they want to be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The primary factor is the dog's well-being. The decision to euthanize is already made because it's the kindest option to prevent suffering. The authors are not neglecting the dog; they're just choosing not to be present during the procedure. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes them an asshole. Well, \"asshole\" here is about empathy and consideration for the dog and others. If they're taking the dog to a reputable vet and ensuring the process is humane, then their primary responsibility as pet owners is fulfilled. Choosing not to be there doesn't affect the dog's comfort or the quality of care. It's their personal choice based on emotional readiness. \n\nSocietal judgment might be a factor, but personal feelings and comfort are valid. Not everyone forms the same level of emotional bond with their pets. The authors are honest about their relationship with the dog not being as intense as others, which is a legitimate reason. The cost issue is also a practical concern; if being present requires more money but doesn't affect the dog's treatment, it's a reasonable decision.\n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. For some people, being present is important for closure, but others might find it too distressing. The authors aren't avoiding responsibility; they're making a choice that's right for them. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? They're making a personal choice that doesn't harm the animal. The key is that the dog's needs are met, which they are. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They are handling the situation with the dog's best interest in mind, considering their own emotional state and practical factors.\n"
