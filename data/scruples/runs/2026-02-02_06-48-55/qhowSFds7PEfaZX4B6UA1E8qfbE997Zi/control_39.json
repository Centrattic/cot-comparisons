While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible For This Action) question is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners have decided it's time to euthanize to prevent suffering. They don't want to be present during the procedure and mention higher costs if they were to be there. The wife is the legal owner, but both are involved. They feel they might be judged but don't have that intense bond with the dog despite previous dogs having strong bonds. The key question is whether not being present makes them the asshole.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, many people believe being present shows respect and love for the pet. It can provide closure and a sense of being with the pet during their last moments. Not being there might be seen as emotionally distant or not honoring the pet's life. On the other hand, the couple's feelings and emotional well-being matter too. If being present would cause them more emotional distress, choosing not to might be a personal choice. They also mentioned taking the dog to a reputable place, which is responsible.\n\nBut the main issue here is the judgment they fear. Society often places a high value on being present for euthanasia. However, each person's bond with their pet is different. The authors don't have that intense bond, and they're making a decision based on their emotional needs. They're still choosing to euthanize, which is an act of compassion. The cost isn't the main issue, but the emotional impact is. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. But the question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If we consider that they're making a responsible decision (euthanasia) and their choice isn't causing harm beyond their own conscience, then maybe not. But if society judges them harshly, does that make them wrong? Or is it about their own feelings versus external judgment? \n\nThey might be wrong if the judgment is about not showing compassion to the dog. But the dog isn't aware, so the act of holding might be more for the owners' closure. If the owners aren't getting emotional closure, maybe they are wrong by their own standards, not others'. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on personal ethics versus societal norms. The authors are prioritizing their emotional state, which is valid. So the answer might be B (they're not in the wrong) because their decision isn't malicious and is based on their relationship with the dog.\n"
