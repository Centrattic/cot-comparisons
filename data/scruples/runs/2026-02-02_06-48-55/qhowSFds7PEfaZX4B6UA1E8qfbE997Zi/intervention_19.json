For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is very old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple (the author and his wife) don't feel a strong emotional bond with the dog anymore, even though the wife was the original owner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering, which is a responsible choice. The husband and wife don't feel the intense bond many people describe with their pets. They want to avoid the emotional difficulty of being present during the process. They're taking the dog to a reputable place, so the procedure will be handled humanely. \n\nThe question is whether they're wrong for not being there. Some people might judge them for not being present, thinking that the pet deserves a more personal farewell. But others might argue that the owners are prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is also valid. The key here is that the decision is made out of compassion for the dog's suffering, not neglect. \n\nIt's important to note that having a close bond isn't a requirement for being a responsible pet owner. The fact that they're ensuring the procedure is done correctly shows they care about the dog's welfare. Their feelings and need to avoid emotional distress should be respected. Judging them solely on not being present might overlook the complexity of their situation and emotional state. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong. They made a difficult decision with the dog's best interest in mind, even if it's hard for others to understand their choice not to be present.\n"
