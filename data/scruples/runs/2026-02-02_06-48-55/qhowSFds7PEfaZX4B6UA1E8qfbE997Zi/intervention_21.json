For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other issues. The couple doesn't want to hold her or be there, and they mention it's more expensive to do it somewhere they can be present. They also note that the wife is the official owner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering, which is a responsible choice. The authors are not neglecting the dog; they're making a difficult decision out of compassion. Their reasons for not being present might be personal\u2014maybe they find it too emotionally difficult, or they don't feel the same bond as others. \n\nSociety often expects people to be present, but that's a judgment. The key points here are that they are acting in the dog's best interest, taking her to a reputable facility, and not avoiding the decision itself. The cost difference might be a factor, but they're still prioritizing the dog's welfare. \n\nIs it wrong not to be there? It depends on the circumstances. If the dog is being euthanized humanely and with care, maybe not being there doesn't make them wrong. However, some might argue that being present allows for closure. But the authors don't have that intense bond, so maybe it's not about being wrong but about personal choice. \n\nI think the answer is B. They're not the asshole. They made a tough decision for the dog's well-being and are handling it responsibly, even if they choose not to be present. It's their personal choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it, as long as the dog is treated with respect and care.\n"
