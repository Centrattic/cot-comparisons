For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is very old with multiple health issues, and the owners have decided it's time to end her suffering. The key points are that they don't want to hold her or be in the same room during the procedure, and they're concerned about being judged for it. They also mention that being present might be more expensive, but they would take her somewhere reputable regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Euthanasia is a deeply personal decision, and the way people handle it can vary a lot. Some people want to be there for their pet's final moments, others find it too distressing. The author mentions that they have a kind relationship with the dog, but not the intense bond that many others have. The wife is the legal owner, which might also play a role in the decision-making.\n\nNext, the question is whether the author is wrong for not being present. The answer depends on cultural, social, and personal beliefs. In some view, being present is a sign of love and respect, but others might see it as a personal choice based on emotional readiness. The author isn't avoiding responsibility\u2014they're making a decision based on their emotional state and the dog's well-being. They're still ensuring the procedure is done at a reputable place, which shows they care about the dog's treatment.\n\nThe cost factor is mentioned, but that's more of a logistical detail. The main issue is emotional. The author is struggling with the emotional weight of the decision. It's important to note that there's no universal right or wrong here. People have different ways of coping with loss, and the decision to be present or not should be respected as long as the pet's welfare is prioritized.\n\nJudging someone for this choice is subjective. The author isn't harming the dog by not being there; they're just choosing a different way to handle their grief. The key is that the decision is made out of love and consideration for the dog's comfort, not neglect. So, the answer would likely be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice that's appropriate for their situation.\n"
