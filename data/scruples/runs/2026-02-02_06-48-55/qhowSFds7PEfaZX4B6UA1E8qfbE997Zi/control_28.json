For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's wrong to not hold their dog during euthanasia. The user provided a scenario where the couple doesn't want to be present, and they feel they might be judged for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, many people believe that being present is important to provide comfort to the pet and to allow the owners to say goodbye. It can be a bonding moment. On the other hand, the couple explains that they don't have that intense bond with this particular dog, and they're both emotionally not ready to be there. Also, the cost is higher for a facility where they can be present, but they'll still take her to a reputable place.\n\nI should check if their reasoning is valid. They mention the dog is 16 and suffering, so euthanasia is a humane choice. The owner (their wife) isn't insisting on being present, so it's not about avoiding responsibility. They might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is understandable. \n\nBut is not being present inherently wrong? Maybe some would argue that you should be there for your pet no matter what. However, others might see that it's okay if it's too hard emotionally. The key points are that they're making a responsible decision for the dog's welfare and that they care for her kindly. The fact that they had a prior bond with other dogs but not this one could affect their emotional response. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the intention. They aren't being cruel or negligent; they're making a tough call based on their circumstances. So the answer is probably B (they're not in the wrong). They're choosing to prioritize their own emotional state while still ensuring the dog is euthanized properly. People might judge, but judgment doesn't equate to being wrong. The main thing is the dog's well-being, which they are addressing.\n"
