While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners have decided it's time to euthanize her to prevent suffering. Neither the author nor his wife wants to be present or hold the dog during the process. They mention that the wife is the official owner since she had the dog before they married. They also note that there's a higher cost if they wanted to be present, but they'd still go to a reputable place regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons they don't want to be there. They say they have a kind relationship with the dog but don't share that intense bond that some people have with their pets. The author has had that bond with previous dogs, but not this one. They also feel societal pressure to be there and might be judged if they aren't. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not accompanying the dog during euthanasia.\n\nI should think about the ethical aspects here. Euthanasia is a compassionate choice to end suffering. The key factors are the dog's well-being and the owners' emotional readiness. If the owners are making the decision out of love and to prevent suffering, that's a positive aspect. Choosing a reputable facility ensures the procedure is done humanely. The fact that they don't want to be present might be due to emotional distress, which is understandable. Not everyone can handle saying goodbye that way. Some people find it too painful, and avoiding it doesn't necessarily make them bad people. \n\nHowever, some might argue that being present allows for a more emotional farewell, which can be important for closure. But the owners have their reasons, and they're prioritizing the dog's comfort. Also, the cost difference is mentioned, but they're not cutting corners; they'll still use a reputable place. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to be present? That's subjective. Different people have different ways of coping. The owners are making a difficult decision with the dog's best interest in mind. They aren't neglecting the dog; they're providing euthanasia to prevent suffering. Their choice not to be there is a personal one and doesn't harm the dog. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a compassionate choice, and their personal emotional needs don't override the dog's welfare. Others might judge, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong.\n"
