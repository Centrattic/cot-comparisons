For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, which is very old, and has several health issues. The key points here are the age of the dog, the owner's relationship with the pet, and the emotional aspect of being present.\n\nFirst, the decision to euthanize is usually made out of love and to prevent suffering. The user mentions that neither they nor their wife want to hold the dog during the procedure, possibly due to the emotional stress. They also note that they have a good relationship with the dog but not as intense as some people might have. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare, the main concern is the dog's comfort. The user says they'll take the dog to a reputable place regardless of their presence. That's important because the procedure should be handled by professionals to ensure it's done humanely. \n\nSocially, there's a common belief that being present is better for the pet and the owner. But not everyone has the same emotional capacity. Forcing someone to be there might lead to more stress for them, which doesn't directly affect the dog. Also, the cost difference is mentioned, but if they can afford a reputable facility, the procedure's quality isn't compromised. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the wife is the legal owner, which might influence the decision. However, the ethical question here is about the action itself. Not being present isn't cruel to the dog if the process is done correctly. The judgment of others is a social issue, not an ethical one. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the decision is in the dog's best interest. Since the dog will be euthanized humanely and the owners are making this decision to prevent suffering, their absence doesn't make them wrong. They're prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
