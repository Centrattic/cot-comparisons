For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's wrong not to hold their 16-year-old dog during euthanasia. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple doesn't want to be present because they don't feel that strong a bond with the dog, even though the wife was the original owner. They mention they'll take her to a reputable place regardless, but the cost is higher if they can be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Euthanasia is a compassionate choice to prevent suffering, so that's a positive point. The couple isn't avoiding the decision out of fear but because of their emotional readiness. They're honest about their feelings, which is important. \n\nSome might argue that being present is a more humane choice for the pet, but the question is whether the author is wrong for not doing it. The bond they describe is weaker compared to others, so maybe it's reasonable for them not to be there. Also, the financial aspect is a practical consideration, though that's not the main ethical issue here. \n\nAnother angle: people have different ways of handling grief and attachment. Not wanting to hold the dog doesn't necessarily mean they don't care. The key is that they're making a decision they believe is in the dog's best interest. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their intentions are good, and they're respecting their own emotional limits while still ensuring the dog's welfare.\n"
