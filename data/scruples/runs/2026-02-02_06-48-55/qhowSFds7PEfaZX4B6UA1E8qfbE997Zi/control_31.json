For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their spouse have decided it's time to euthanize to prevent suffering. They don't want to be present or hold the dog, and they mention the cost difference if they went somewhere where they could be there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Euthanasia is a tough decision, and it's done out of love to stop the dog's pain. The couple isn't being cruel; they just don't feel the same emotional bond as others might. Maybe they're processing the grief differently. \n\nBut there's a common belief that being present is the right thing. Some might argue that the pet deserves to be with the people who loved them. However, the author is being honest about their feelings and the situation. They're still choosing to end the suffering, which is compassionate. \n\nThe key points are the dog's well-being and the couple's emotional state. If they believe it's best for the dog to be put to sleep and are ensuring it's done in a reputable place, their intention is good. Not being there doesn't make them the asshole if they've made a considered decision. \n\nAlso, the cost factor is a practical issue. It's not about saving money but about where the procedure can be done. Maybe the cheaper option is a no-questions-asked place, but they still plan to use a reputable one. \n\nIn the end, it's their choice. People grieve differently. As long as the dog is treated humanely and the decision is made to prevent suffering, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
