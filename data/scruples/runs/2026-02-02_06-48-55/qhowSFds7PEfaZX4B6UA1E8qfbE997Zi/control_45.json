She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dog is 16 years old and has multiple severe health issues. The owners have decided it's time for euthanasia to prevent suffering. The key point is that neither the author nor his wife wants to hold the dog or be in the same room during the procedure. They mention that the wife was the original owner, but both are involved in the decision. The author is concerned about being judged because some people might expect them to be there, and they also note the higher cost of being present.\n\nI need to consider if their decision makes them the \"asshole.\" Well, the main factors here are the welfare of the dog and the owners' emotional state. The primary concern should be ensuring the dog is euthanized humanely, which they plan to do by taking her to a reputable place. The owners are not avoiding the responsibility; they\u2019re making a decision based on their emotional readiness. It's their personal choice, and there's no indication they're neglecting the dog's needs. Many people might prefer to be present, but that's a personal preference. Others might find it too painful. The cost factor isn't a moral issue here since they\u2019re still getting proper care. So, unless they're avoiding the process out of selfishness, they\u2019re not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
