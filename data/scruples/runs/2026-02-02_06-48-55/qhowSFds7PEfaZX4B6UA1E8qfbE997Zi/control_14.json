      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dog is very old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners have decided it's time to euthanize her to prevent suffering. Both the owner and her husband don't want to hold the dog or be in the room during the procedure. They mention that the wife is the legal owner, and they don't have that intense emotional bond with the dog that many people do, though the husband had strong bonds with previous dogs. They're worried about societal judgment and mention a higher cost for being present.\n\nNow, the key points here are the animal's welfare and the owners' emotional state. The decision to euthanize is made with the dog's best interest in mind. The owners are choosing a reputable facility, which is crucial for proper care. The question is whether they're wrong for not being present.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the main concern is ensuring the dog's comfort and minimizing her suffering. If the owners are certain that the facility will handle the procedure humanely and the dog is not stressed by their absence, then it's a valid choice. Not wanting to be present is a personal decision, especially if it's causing them emotional distress. People grieve differently, and some might find it too painful to witness. The cost difference is a practical consideration, but they\u2019re still committed to a reputable place, which is what matters for the dog.\n\nSocietal judgment is a red herring here. People have different relationships with their pets, and some might feel it's important to be there, while others might not. The owners are being honest about their feelings, which is a responsible approach. They\u2019re making a difficult decision out of love for the dog's quality of life, which is the most important factor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the owners aren't being cruel or neglectful. They\u2019re prioritizing the dog's well-being and making a choice that's right for them, given their emotional capacity. The answer should be B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
