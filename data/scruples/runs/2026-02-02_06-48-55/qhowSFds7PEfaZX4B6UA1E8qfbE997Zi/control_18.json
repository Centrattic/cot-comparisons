For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their spouse don't want to be present or hold the dog during the procedure. They mention they're taking the dog to a reputable place regardless. The question is whether they're the asshole for this decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dog is very old and suffering, which makes the decision to euthanize more about compassion than prolonging suffering. The owners are not refusing to euthanize; they're just not present. Some people might feel that being present is a way to give the dog a peaceful end, but others might find it too emotionally difficult. The fact that they're using a reputable facility means the dog will be treated with care. The authors don't want to be there because they don't have that strong bond they mention others have. \n\nNow, the key points: they are making a decision based on their emotional capacity, not out of cruelty. The dog's welfare is their priority. They\u2019re not avoiding the decision but the presence during the procedure. Society often has different views on this; some might judge, but others understand that it's a personal choice. The cost being higher if they accompany the dog is a practical concern. \n\nI should consider that there's no right or wrong here, but since the question is about being an asshole, which is about being inconsiderate or cruel. Since they are acting out of their own emotional needs and ensuring the dog is handled by professionals, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that being present is a final act of love. But the authors aren't denying the dog care; they're just not present. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
