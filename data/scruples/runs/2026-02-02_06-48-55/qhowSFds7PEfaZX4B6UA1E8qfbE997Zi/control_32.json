For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for This?) post is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The husband and wife don't feel a strong emotional bond with the dog compared to previous pets, and they're worried about being judged if they don't be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The main point is that they don't want to be there, which is a personal choice. The dog's owner (wife) and the husband both don't feel the same intense bond. They also mention the cost difference if they need to be present, but they say they'd take the dog to a reputable place regardless.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, many people do prefer to be with their pets during euthanasia, but it's not universally required. The key here is that the decision is made out of compassion to prevent suffering, which is the right thing to do. The authors are not denying the dog's best interest; they're making a choice based on their emotional readiness. \n\nJudgment often comes from others' expectations, but the authors aren't harming the dog. They're just not present during the procedure. It's important to note that being present isn't the only way to show love or respect. The dog's comfort is the priority, and the owners are making a decision that they believe is right for their pet.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their relationship with the dog and their own emotional state, not neglect or cruelty. The higher cost is a practical consideration but not a moral one. They are still ensuring the dog is treated well. Therefore, the authors aren't ass-holes for making this personal choice.\n"
