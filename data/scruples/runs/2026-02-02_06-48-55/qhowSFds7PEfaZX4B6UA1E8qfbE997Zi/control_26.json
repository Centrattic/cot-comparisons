For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to hold their dog during euthanasia. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dog is 16 years old and has multiple health issues\u2014blind, deaf, and other problems. The owners feel it's time to euthanize her to prevent suffering. Neither the husband nor the wife wants to be present during the procedure. The wife is the legal owner, having had the dog before they married. They mention they're kind to the dog but don't have that deep bond others might. They also note that being present would cost more, but they'd still go to a reputable place.\n\nThe key points here are their reasons for not being present. They don't feel a strong emotional connection, which is personal and a bit unique since the husband had that bond with previous dogs. They also mention the cost, but it's not the main factor. The question is whether they're the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider societal norms. Many people believe being present is important for closure and showing love. However, not everyone forms that kind of bond. The owners are still making the responsible decision to euthanize to prevent suffering, which is a compassionate act. Their reasons for not being present are personal and not malicious. They're not avoiding responsibility; they\u2019re making a choice based on their feelings. \n\nJudgment can be harsh in these situations, but the rightness of their action depends on their intentions. They\u2019re not neglecting the dog; they\u2019re ensuring her comfort. The decision not to be present is a personal one and doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of care. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
