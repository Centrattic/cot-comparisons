For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The couple doesn't want to hold her or be in the room, even though they're taking her to a reputable place. They mention that the wife originally owned the dog and that they don't have the same intense bond as many people do with their pets. They're worried about judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering, which is a responsible choice. The couple isn't avoiding responsibility because they're still ensuring the dog's comfort by going to a reputable facility. Their reason for not being present is their emotional state\u2014they don't want to be there, which is a personal choice. Society often expects people to be present, but that doesn't make it right or wrong. The key here is that they're making a decision based on their feelings and circumstances without neglecting the dog's well-being. \n\nIs it wrong to not be there? Well, the primary responsibility is ensuring the dog's comfort, which they are doing. The emotional aspect of being present is subjective. Some people find closure in being there, others find it too painful. There's no universal standard here. Also, the cost aspect is mentioned, but as long as they're choosing a reputable place, the cost shouldn't invalidate their decision. They are still providing a humane end for the pet. \n\nJudgment from others is a separate issue. The question is about whether they're actually wrong, not about facing social judgment. Since their actions are in the best interest of the dog and they\u2019re making a personal choice based on their emotional needs, it's not about being an asshole. They\u2019re not causing harm; they\u2019re managing their own emotional response. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, they are not in the wrong.\n"
