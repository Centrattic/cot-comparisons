For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who doesn't want to hold their dog during euthanasia is in the wrong. The dog is 16 years old and has significant health issues, so euthanasia is necessary. The owners don't feel a strong emotional bond with the dog, but they still want to make sure it's done at a reputable place. The main issue is whether they're being judged for not being present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The decision to euthanize is already made because the dog is suffering. The owners are not avoiding the responsibility; they\u2019re just not emotionally attached enough to want to be there. The cost difference is mentioned, but they say they'd still go somewhere reputable. That shows they care about the process, just not about being present.\n\nSociety often expects people to be there for their pets, but that's a personal choice. There's no right or wrong in how people grieve or handle their emotions. Maybe they had a better relationship with previous dogs, but this dog isn't as close. It's important to recognize that people have different ways of dealing with loss.\n\nAlso, the cost aspect might be a factor for some people. If being present is more expensive but they can't afford it, that's a different situation, but here they say they can afford a reputable place regardless. So the financial part isn't the issue here. The key is their emotional readiness. They aren't avoiding the decision or the process; they\u2019re just making a personal choice based on their feelings.\n\nJudgment from others might stem from societal norms, but the owners are acting in the dog's best interest. They acknowledge the dog's suffering and want to end it. The fact that they\u2019re not emotionally close to the dog now doesn't negate their responsibility. So, in terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's more about intentions and actions. Their actions are compassionate, even if their emotional involvement is less. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
