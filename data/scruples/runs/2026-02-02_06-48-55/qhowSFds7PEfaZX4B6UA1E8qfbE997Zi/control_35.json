While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16 years old, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their spouse don't want to hold the dog or be in the room during the procedure. They mention that the wife originally owned the dog, and the author has had a strong bond with previous dogs but not this one. They also note the higher cost of being present and their intention to use a reputable facility regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Euthanizing a pet is a difficult decision, and people have different ways of coping. Some find comfort in being there for their pet, while others might find it too distressing. The key points here are the owners' feelings and the well-being of the dog.\n\nThe dog's comfort is paramount. If the owners believe that not being present is the right decision for them, but the dog wouldn't suffer either way, maybe it's not about their presence but the quality of care. The cost aspect is mentioned, but the author states they'll use a reputable place regardless, so the care quality isn't compromised.\n\nSocietal judgment might play a role here. Some people might judge others for not being present, thinking it's a lack of love. However, it's important to recognize that everyone's relationship with their pets is different. The author's previous strong bonds with other dogs suggest they are capable of caring, but this particular dog might not have the same bond. That could be a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the decision to euthanize is already an act of compassion to prevent suffering. The method of euthanasia (with or without the owners present) doesn't affect the dog's experience. The owners' emotional state is also a factor. If being present would cause them significant distress, maybe it's better for them to handle it in a way that's emotionally manageable.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, being present might be expected, but others might not hold that view. The question is whether the author is the \"asshole,\" which is subjective. The key is whether their decision is selfish or neglectful. Since the dog's care is not compromised, and the decision is based on personal comfort and circumstances, it's more about personal choice rather than wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They are making a decision based on their emotional needs and circumstances without harming the dog. The judgment of others shouldn't dictate their personal choice in this compassionate act.\n"
