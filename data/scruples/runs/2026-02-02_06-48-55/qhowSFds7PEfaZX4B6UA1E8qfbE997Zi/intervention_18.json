For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The dog is 16, blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owner and their wife don't want to hold the dog or be in the room, and they mention not having that intense bond with the dog as they do with previous pets. They\u2019re concerned about being judged but want to know if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The decision to euthanize is based on the dog's quality of life, which is a responsible choice. The owners are prioritizing the dog's comfort and avoiding further suffering. The question is about their emotional involvement in the process.\n\nSome people might argue that being present is a way to show love and respect, especially for a long-term pet. But others might say that the decision is about what's best for the dog, and if the owners are not emotionally attached enough, they might not be the right people to end the dog's life. However, the post says they are kind to the dog and would take her to a reputable place regardless.\n\nAnother angle is the cost difference. If being present costs more, but they still choose to have the procedure done somewhere else, is that neglect? Probably not, since the main priority is the dog's comfort. The key here is the intent: they\u2019re not doing it for their own convenience but to avoid suffering the dog.\n\nThe user says they feel judged if they don't do it. Society often has strong opinions on pet care, but the owners are making a practical decision. The bond varies between pets, and maybe they genuinely don't have the same connection. That doesn't make them bad people necessarily. \n\nBut is it their responsibility to be there? Some might say yes, that it's part of being a responsible owner to be present in the final moments. But others might say that the owners have the right to make decisions based on their emotional capacity. \n\nI need to check if there's a moral obligation to be present. If the owners are making a decision that's in the dog's best interest, maybe the method of how they do it is less important. The main thing is that the dog isn't suffering. \n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a difficult decision based on the dog's well-being, and their emotional state is a personal matter. The judgment from others is subjective, but their intent is good.\n"
