For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about deciding not to be present when their 16-year-old dog is euthanized. The dog is blind, deaf, and has other health issues, so the decision to euthanize is made to prevent suffering. The author and their wife are both okay with ending the dog's life but don't want to be there during the procedure. They mention that the dog was their wife's before marriage and that they don't have the same intense bond as some people do with their pets. They also note that being present might cost more but they would go to a reputable place regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Euthanasia is a common and compassionate choice when an animal is suffering. The main intention here is to end the dog's suffering, which is a responsible decision. The debate is about whether being present is necessary. Some people believe that being there is part of the responsibility and love for the pet, while others might find it too emotionally difficult. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to let the dog be euthanized; they just don't want to be physically present. They are still ensuring the dog is treated humanely, just not by their side during the procedure. The cost difference is mentioned, but they say they'd still go to a reputable place, so the dog's well-being isn't compromised. \n\nSociety often has different views on this. Some might judge them for not being there, thinking it's a lack of compassion. Others might understand that it's a personal choice based on their relationship with the dog and their emotional capacity. The key points are the intention to prevent suffering, the decision made in the dog's best interest, and the fact that the authors are still taking responsibility by ensuring proper care.\n\nThe question is whether they are the \"asshole\" if they don't hold the dog. The term here is subjective. If the term is about being cruel or irresponsible, then they aren't, since their actions are in the dog's best interest. However, if it's about emotional judgment from others, that's more about societal expectations than actual wrongdoing. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision is based on the dog's welfare, and their emotional readiness isn't a fault. The judgment from others doesn't equate to being wrong morally or ethically. It's a personal choice, and as long as the dog is treated humanely, it's acceptable.\n"
