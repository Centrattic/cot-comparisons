While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should hold their dog while she's being euthanized. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe dog is 16 years old, which is really old, so it's probably time for her to be put down. They mention she's blind, deaf, and has other health issues. The owners, the author and his wife, don't want to be present during the procedure. The wife is the actual owner, but both are making this decision. They don't have that intense bond with the dog that some people do, even though the author had strong bonds with previous dogs. They're worried about being judged if they don't hold the dog during euthanasia. Also, there's a higher cost if they take her somewhere where they can be present. They do say they'll take her somewhere reputable regardless.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons they don't want to be there. It's not because they don't care; they just don't have the same emotional attachment as others. Maybe they're trying to protect themselves emotionally. But people often expect to be present for their pets' final moments. Is there a right or wrong here?\n\nAnother angle: euthanasia is about ending suffering. The main concern is the pet's comfort. If they're not holding her, but she's still comfortable, maybe that's okay. But some might argue the owners should be there for their pet's last moments. However, if the owners are struggling emotionally, forcing them to be there might not be fair either.\n\nAlso, the cost aspect. They mention higher costs if they go to a place where they can be present. But if they choose a cheaper option where they can't be there, does that affect the dog's care? They say they'll take her to a reputable place regardless. So the dog's treatment isn't compromised, just the owners' presence.\n\nJudgment from others is a big part of their concern. Society often idealizes being there for pets' deaths, but maybe it's not a black-and-white issue. The author's reasoning is that they don't have the same bond, so it's not their fault. They're making a decision based on their emotional capacity and circumstances.\n\nI should also think about the definition of an \"asshole.\" If the author is not being cruel or neglectful, just making a personal choice based on their feelings, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if their decision is seen as callous or disrespectful, some might judge them. But since they're making the decision to end the dog's suffering out of compassion, even if they don't want to be there, that seems like a responsible choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being wrong. They're prioritizing the dog's well-being by choosing euthanasia and making a personal choice about their own emotional state. So the answer should be B.\n"
