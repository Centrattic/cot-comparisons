For many reasons, we have determined it is time to euthanize her rather than let her suffer. She is blind and deaf with a host of other issues. \n\nNeither my wife (who is really the dog's owner as she had the dog before we were married), nor I really want to hold the dog or even be in the same room while she is being euthanized.  While we are certainly kind to the dog, neither one of us really has that intense man/dog relationship with her that many people experience with their pets (even though I've had that with all of my prior dogs). Yet, I feel like I'll be judged if we don't do it. There is also a much higher cost to do it somewhere where we can be present. We would certainly be taking her somewhere reputable regardless. \n\nI don't want to give too many details - just want judgment on whether I'm the asshole if I do not accompany the dog when she is put to sleep. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" thread is in the wrong for not wanting to be present during their dog's euthanasia. The scenario is that their dog is 16, very old, and suffering from multiple issues like blindness and deafness. The couple doesn't feel a strong emotional bond with the dog anymore and doesn't want to hold her during the process. They also mention the cost difference if they were to be present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. Euthanasia is a tough decision, and the couple has made it based on the dog's quality of life. The question is about whether not being present is wrong. \n\nSome people might argue that being present is a compassionate choice because it allows for closure and a final moment of comfort for the pet. However, others might say that if the owners don't feel a strong bond, their emotional state could affect the process. Also, the cost consideration is a practical factor. \n\nBut the main point is the emotional bond. The user mentions they had that bond with previous dogs but not this one. It's possible that the current dog didn't form the same attachment, so maybe the owners aren't being selfish; they're being honest about their feelings. \n\nJudgment from others might be an issue, but the question is whether they are objectively in the wrong. Ethically, as long as they're making the decision in the dog's best interest and not out of neglect or cruelty, it's hard to say they're wrong. The key is that they're choosing a reputable place regardless, so the dog isn't being mistreated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No) because their decision is based on their relationship with the dog and practical reasons, not malice.\n"
