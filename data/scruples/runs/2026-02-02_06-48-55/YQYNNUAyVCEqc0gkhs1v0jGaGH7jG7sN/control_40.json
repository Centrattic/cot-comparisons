But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean because they look Japanese. The cashier made a comment when the author pointed out a pricing error, and now the author wants to report her without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements here. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author corrected a price. The author is bilingual and was able to catch the comment. \n\nThe key points are: the cashier was being disrespectful, using inappropriate language, and making offensive remarks. Even if it's in another language, if the employee is being unprofessional or hostile, it's a valid concern. The author isn't reporting for something minor but for a direct insult and unprofessional behavior. Also, the cashier's comment included a racial stereotype (\"go back to Japan\") which is offensive regardless of the language used. \n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's behavior affecting others too. The store has only two registers, so the cashier might interact with many customers, potentially harming their experience. The author's intention is to report the behavior, not to get the cashier fired, just to stop the negative talk. \n\nThe cashier was aware the author was a customer, so the comment was directed at them in a professional setting. Even if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, the fact that she made a racial remark is a problem. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to take action to prevent this from happening to others. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and offensive. The author's bilingualism allowed them to recognize the issue, which others might not have. Therefore, the correct answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
