But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier.\n\nFirst, the cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, and the author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize. The cashier was mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the cashier was being rude to customers, which is unprofessional. The author is bilingual and heard the slurs. Reporting the behavior is about workplace conduct. The cashier might be violating company policies by speaking negatively about customers. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not necessarily to get her fired. The author is in a position to report because they can understand the language. But the cashier didn't know the author was Korean. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. The author has a right to report it. The cashier's comments were directed at the author, even if she didn't know who they were. The manager needs to be informed about the unprofessional conduct. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but wants to stop the harassment. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
