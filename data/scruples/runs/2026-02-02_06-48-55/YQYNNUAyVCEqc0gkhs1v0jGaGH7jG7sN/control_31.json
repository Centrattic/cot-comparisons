But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and lives in an area with a lot of Japanese people. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the employees think they're Japanese because they speak English. The cashier in question mumbles negative comments in Korean about customers, which the author can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier specifically made a derogatory comment in Korean about the author, implying they should go back to Japan. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. The cashier was being rude and using offensive language towards a customer. The author didn't want to confront her directly and instead chose to report it. The author is concerned about the cashier's job security but also wants to stop the behavior. \n\nIn such cases, reporting harassment or inappropriate behavior is usually the right thing to do. The cashier's comments were not just stress-related but targeted the customer with a racial slur (telling them to go back to Japan). Even if the cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, making derogatory remarks about someone's ethnicity is unacceptable. The author is in a position where they can address the issue without causing harm by reporting it to the manager. The manager can then handle the situation appropriately. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired just for being stressed but is addressing the racial comment and harassment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting.\n"
