But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but passes as Japanese and the cashier didn't realize that. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand, and made a comment about the customer going back to Japan. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The cashier was talking about customers in a negative way, but she didn't know the author could understand. The author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year. The cashier's comment was offensive, even if she didn't use English. \n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want the cashier to lose her job but also want her to stop the behavior. The question is whether the author is wrong to report this. \n\nOn one hand, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if it's in another language, making derogatory remarks about customers is inappropriate. The author has the right to feel disrespected and wants to address it. On the other hand, the cashier didn't know the author understood Korean, so maybe she didn't intend to target the author specifically, but the comment was still made in the author's presence.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to report this? Since the cashier's comments could affect other customers too, reporting it might be a valid action. However, the author is using their knowledge of Korean to their advantage here. But the cashier's behavior is still unprofessional regardless of the language used. \n\nThe author is in a position where they can understand the criticism, which other customers might not. If others don't notice, the cashier might continue, affecting the author and possibly others. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without getting the cashier fired, which seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the cashier's actions are unprofessional, and the author is justified in wanting to report it. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing inappropriate behavior that affects their experience and potentially others, even if the cashier didn't know the author understood Korean.\n"
