But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier didn't realize. The cashier mumbled complaints, and then when there was a pricing issue, she made a harsh comment in Korean. The author wants to report this but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was talking negatively about customers, which is unprofessional. Even if it's in another language, it's still part of her job interactions. The author caught her being rude, but only because the cashier didn't know the author was Korean. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not revealing their identity? Maybe not. The cashier assumed the author was Japanese based on appearance, which is a common bias. The author didn't misrepresent themselves; they just didn't correct the cashier. So the cashier's behavior was unprofessional regardless of the language used. \n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior, not to get the cashier fired. They want the manager to address the unprofessional conduct. Since the cashier's comments were directed at customers (and the author was one), the author has a right to bring it up. \n\nHowever, maybe the manager could see it as the author interfering unnecessarily. But the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. The author is in a position to provide feedback because they were a direct victim. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves and addressing unprofessional behavior without intent to harm the cashier's job. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author has a valid reason to report it.\n"
