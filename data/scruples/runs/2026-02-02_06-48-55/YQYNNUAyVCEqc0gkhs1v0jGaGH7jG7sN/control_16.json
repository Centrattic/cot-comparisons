But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is Korean but looks Japanese, and they go to a Korean grocery store where the employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier has been muttering complaints in Korean about customers, and recently, after a pricing error, the cashier made some derogatory comments in Korean, which the author understood.\n\nFirst, the author is bilingual, so they can understand the cashier's mutterings. The cashier is using Korean, which the author can understand, but others might not. The cashier is clearly talking negatively about customers, which the author has tolerated before, thinking maybe the job is stressful. But now, after the pricing issue, the cashier made a personal attack, implying the author is cheap and should go back to Japan. The author wants to report this behavior to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if the cashier didn't know the author's background, making negative comments about customers is inappropriate. The author has the right to feel disrespected. Since the author can understand the comments, it's not like the cashier was speaking in a private language. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired, just to stop the behavior. The cashier's comments were directed at the author and could be considered harassment or rude. Reporting it to the manager is reasonable to address the issue without necessarily causing termination. The manager should handle it appropriately. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
