But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier has been making rude comments in Korean, which the customer can understand because they're Korean but pass as Japanese. The customer wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier is talking negatively about customers in her native language, thinking the customer doesn't understand. The customer did catch her in a specific instance where the cashier made a personal attack. The customer is bilingual and wants to address the behavior but is hesitant about the cashier's job security.\n\nIs the cashier at fault? Definitely, because she's making disrespectful comments about customers, even if it's in another language. Customers have the right to feel respected. The fact that she did it in Korean doesn't make it okay, especially since the customer understands. The cashier's comments could be seen as discriminatory or rude, regardless of the language used.\n\nNow, is the customer in the wrong for reporting? They want to report the manager but are concerned about the cashier losing her job. The customer's intention is to stop the behavior without causing harm. They have a valid reason to report the behavior since it's unprofessional and disrespectful. The customer isn't trying to get her fired immediately but to address the issue. \n\nBut maybe the customer could handle it differently. For example, speaking to the manager in a way that focuses on the behavior without revealing their identity. However, the cashier's actions are unprofessional, so reporting is reasonable. The customer isn't the one being rude; they're standing up for themselves after being targeted. \n\nSo, the cashier is clearly in the wrong, and the customer is justified in wanting to report the behavior. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
