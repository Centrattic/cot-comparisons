But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she thought the author was Japanese. The author is considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the cashier's behavior is actually inappropriate. She was mumbling in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier's comments were about customers being demanding and making her life hard. The author heard her say something offensive, implying the customer should go back to Japan and suggesting they're broke. That's pretty harsh, even if it's not the most explicit hate speech. The cashier was addressing the customer directly, even if she didn't realize they understood. \n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's behavior, which could be considered unprofessional. The cashier's remarks were personal and could make customers feel unwelcome. The grocery store has two registers, so the cashier's behavior could affect many customers. The author is in a position where they might encounter her often, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for reporting? The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired, just to stop the behavior. The cashier's comments were directed at the customer, even if it was in another language. The fact that the cashier thought the customer was Japanese doesn't negate the unprofessionalism of her comments. The author has a right to feel offended and to report the behavior, especially since it's a workplace issue. The manager should be informed to address the problem without necessarily terminating the employee. \n\nI don't see how the author is in the wrong here. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and offensive, and the author is taking a responsible approach by reporting it but not seeking punishment. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
