But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author overheard and now wants to address.\n\nFirst, the cashier was making negative comments in Korean, which the author, being bilingual, could understand. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she assumed the author was Japanese. That's a key point because the cashier might have thought her language was private.\n\nThe author is considering reporting the cashier but doesn't want her fired. So the question is whether reporting is justified. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but more about complaining, which could be seen as unprofessional. However, since the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, maybe she felt it was safe to speak that way, thinking customers wouldn't understand.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they want to stop the behavior but are worried about the cashier's job. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to weigh the pros and cons. Is it right to report someone for something they didn't know was being heard? On one hand, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be against store policies. On the other hand, the cashier might not have intended to be rude, thinking she was speaking in a language the customer wouldn't understand.\n\nAlso, the cashier corrected the price after being told, which shows she did her job. The author might be overstepping by reporting, but the comments were directed at customers, which could affect the shopping experience. The manager should be aware of any unprofessional conduct, even if it's in another language. However, the author's intent is to stop the behavior without causing harm, so maybe they're justified in reporting.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the cashier's comments are in her native language and the store employs bilingual staff, perhaps the manager should be aware of the issue. The author has a right to a respectful environment. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the cashier's behavior is unprofessional regardless, so reporting is appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
