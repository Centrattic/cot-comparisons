But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been misperceived as such by the store employees. The cashier, who's also Korean, talks in Korean while working, which the author can understand because he's bilingual. The cashier mumbled negative comments about customers in Korean, which the author could hear. The recent incident involved the cashier making a price mistake, and then the author corrected her. In response, the cashier allegedly said something derogatory in Korean, implying that the author was being a hassle and maybe suggesting he should go back to Japan because he's saving 50 cents. The author is considering reporting this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Let's consider the key points.\n\nThe cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author, being a bilingual customer, heard it. In some workplaces, there might be policies against disparaging customers, even in a different language. If the cashier's comments were derogatory or unprofessional, then reporting it could be justified. However, the cashier might not have realized the author could understand, which complicates things.\n\nThe cashier's comment towards the author seems more targeted. She made a personal remark, possibly involving a racial slur or xenophobic comment (\"why not go back to Japan\") after the author corrected a price error. That's a direct personal attack, which is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. If true, that would be a valid reason to report her.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior without getting the cashier fired. The author is concerned about the manager's reaction if they find out the cashier didn't realize the author was Korean. But the author's right to a respectful treatment as a customer is important. The cashier's behavior could be seen as harassment or unprofessional conduct, which the store should address.\n\nHowever, the author is in a position of knowing something the cashier didn't (being bilingual). Could that affect the situation? If the cashier was merely muttering to herself in her native language without intending for customers to hear, the author might be overhearing something that wasn't intended for them. But if the cashier is clearly talking about customers in a way that's meant to be derogatory, even if in another language, the store should be aware of it. The manager might need to address the cashier's workplace behavior regardless of the language used.\n\nAlso, the cashier's comment about the author being Japanese and the racial slur could be a form of discrimination, which is a serious issue. The author is within their rights to seek a resolution, especially if it's affecting their shopping experience and making them uncomfortable. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but wants to stop the negative treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting if the cashier's comments were just venting about the job stress, not directed at the author. But given the specific incident where the cashier made a personal remark, this seems more targeted. The author's decision to report it is about stopping unprofessional behavior, not just personal dislike.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they want to report the issue but also be considerate of the cashier's job. That shows intent to resolve the issue without malicious intent. The manager's response would depend on the store's policies, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the behavior that's causing them distress.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason to report unprofessional and potentially discriminatory comments made by an employee, especially when it's affecting their experience as a customer.\n"
