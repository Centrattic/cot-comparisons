But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but appears Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, mumbles negative comments in Korean during checkout. The key event is when the cashier, after a pricing error, makes a derogatory remark in Korean that the author understands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the cashier's behavior. The cashier is mumbling in Korean, which others might not understand, but the author does. The cashier's comments are not highly offensive but involve complaining about customers. However, in the specific incident, the cashier made a direct insult, implying the customer was being a hassle for 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan. \n\nThe author's dilemma is whether to report this behavior. The cashier was unaware the author is Korean, so the insult was unintentional but still occurred. The author wants to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job. \n\nFrom a perspective of right and wrong, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if the comments are in another language, making derogatory remarks about customers is inappropriate. The author has a right to a respectful service environment. However, the cashier might not have intended to target the author specifically, given the misunderstanding about her ethnicity. \n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior to the manager, which is a reasonable step to ensure the workplace maintains professionalism. The author is not seeking revenge but wants the behavior to stop. The cashier could face consequences, but the author wants to avoid that, indicating a desire for a fair resolution rather than punishment. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, it's important to recognize that the cashier might be under stress and using her native language to express frustration. However, this doesn't excuse unprofessional conduct towards customers. The author, as a customer, has the right to voice concerns about being treated disrespectfully, even if the comments were made in another language. \n\nConsidering the scenario, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier's actions, while possibly unintentional in targeting the author, were still unprofessional and disrespectful. The author's approach seeks a resolution without unnecessary harm to the cashier, showing consideration. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
