But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was being rude in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese and spoke English. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, which the author, being bilingual, can understand. Recently, the cashier made a racist comment in Korean, which the author heard. The author wants to report the behavior but doesn't want the cashier fired because she might not know the author is Korean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was disrespectful, even if it's not directly to the author. The author has a right to a respectful environment. The cashier's behavior could be considered harassment or discrimination, especially if it's targeted at customers based on their perceived ethnicity. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired just for the comment but to stop the behavior. The manager should be informed because it's a workplace issue affecting customers.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might not have known the author is Korean, so maybe she didn't intend malice towards the author specifically. However, her comments are still inappropriate regardless of the audience. The author is in a position to address the issue because they can understand the comments. Since the store employees are likely Korean, the manager might be aware of the language used, but the author's report could prompt them to address the behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's intention is to stop the behavior without causing harm. Reporting the issue to the manager is a responsible action, especially since the comments are offensive. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants the environment to improve. Therefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
