But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author understood because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was mumbling complaints in Korean, which the author overheard. The cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing issue. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nThe author's intention is to stop the behavior, not to cause harm. They're concerned about the cashier's treatment towards customers, even though it's in another language. Since the cashier didn't know the author understood Korean, the author is in a unique position to address this. \n\nIs the author obligated to stay silent? Probably not. Reporting unethical behavior is generally acceptable, especially when it's discriminatory or unprofessional. The cashier's comments could be seen as harassment or creating a hostile environment for customers. The author isn't fabricating something; they're bringing up real instances where the cashier spoke negatively. \n\nThe author is also trying to balance reporting the issue without causing the cashier to lose her job. That shows consideration. The manager should be informed so they can address the behavior appropriately. The cashier might not realize that her comments are overheard or that they're unprofessional. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report. They\u2019re acting in the interest of maintaining a respectful environment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
