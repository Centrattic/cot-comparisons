But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is Korean but looks Japanese and is bilingual. They go to a Korean grocery store where employees assume they're Japanese because they speak English. The cashier in question has been mumbling complaints in Korean about customers, which the author has noticed but ignored before. However, after an incident where the cashier made a pricing error and then made a derogatory comment in Korean that the author understood, they're considering reporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier's comment was not only about the author but also included a racial slur suggesting the author should go back to Japan. The author wants to report this behavior but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the cashier was being rude and unprofessional. The author has a right to feel disrespected, especially since the cashier didn't know they were Korean. The comment was directed at the author and was offensive. Reporting the behavior to the manager seems reasonable because it's a workplace issue. The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to stop the behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate reason to report the misconduct without malicious intent.\n"
