But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, which the author could understand. The situation escalated when the cashier made a comment about the author after a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier was mumbled in Korean, which she probably thought the customers couldn't understand. The author, being Korean, could understand her negative comments. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, especially since she's talking ill of customers, even if it's in another language. The author's intent is to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired, just to stop the behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the cashier's actions were unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author is taking action because they were targeted, which is their right. However, the cashier might not have known the author was Korean, so the author's decision to reveal their identity could affect the cashier. \n\nBut the cashier was being rude to customers in general, not just the author. By reporting, the author is addressing a behavior that's inappropriate regardless of the cashier's intent. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but wants to stop being insulted. The cashier's comment about the author's background (suggesting they go back to Japan) adds a layer of possible racial or ethnic insensitivity, which is more serious.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so the author's report might come as a surprise. But the cashier's actions were still unprofessional. The author is taking responsibility to address the issue without wanting to fire the cashier, which shows they're not overreacting.\n\nIn conclusion, the cashier's behavior is the main issue here. The author is acting in their right to report unprofessional and potentially discriminatory comments. The cashier should be held accountable for her actions regardless of her intent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting.\n"
