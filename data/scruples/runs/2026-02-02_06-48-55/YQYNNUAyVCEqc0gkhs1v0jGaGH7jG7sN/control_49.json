But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and has been shopping at a Korean store where employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier has been muttering in Korean about customers, which the author can understand. Recently, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean when the author pointed out a pricing error.\n\nThe author wants to report the cashier but is worried about getting her fired. The key points here are: the cashier was speaking in Korean, assuming the customer didn't understand, but the customer does. The cashier's comments were negative and possibly offensive. The author wants to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was being disrespectful and unprofessional. The author has a right to feel disrespected. By reporting, the author is addressing the issue without making it personal. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants the behavior to stop. Also, the cashier might not realize the author understands Korean. The author is trying to handle it discreetly. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
