But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, which the author, who's Korean but mistaken for Japanese, overheard. The cashier specifically made a derogatory comment towards the author after a pricing issue.\n\nThe author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the cashier's actions. The cashier is talking negatively about customers in their presence, even if it's in another language. That's unprofessional and could be considered harassment or discrimination. The cashier's comment about the author \"going back to Japan\" implies racial or ethnic slurs, which is definitely problematic.\n\nThe author overheard this, which is a valid concern. Reporting an employee for unprofessional behavior is generally acceptable, especially if it's discriminatory. The author's intent is to address the behavior, not to get the cashier fired immediately, which is reasonable.\n\nThe user's hesitation comes from thinking the author might be overreacting. But given the cashier's comments were directed at the author and included racial implications, the author has a right to report it. The cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used, especially since the author understands Korean.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, so the author is justified in taking action to address the issue.\n"
