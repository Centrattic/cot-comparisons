But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the customer can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the customer is Korean, so she talked about them behind their back. The customer wants to report her but doesn't want her to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's actions are inappropriate. Even if she didn't realize the customer understood, making disparaging remarks about customers, even in another language, is unprofessional. It's a form of verbal abuse, even if not directed at them directly. Employers usually have policies against such behavior because it affects customer service and creates a hostile environment.\n\nThe customer's intention is to address the issue without causing the cashier to lose her job. That's a reasonable approach. They want to inform the manager so that the behavior stops. Since the cashier's comments could be seen as discriminatory or offensive (especially the part about going back to Japan), reporting it would be appropriate. The customer isn't seeking retaliation, just a resolution.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They had to deal with being spoken about negatively in their own language, which can be hurtful. The cashier's actions were unprofessional, and the customer is within their rights to bring it up. The answer should be B, No.\n"
