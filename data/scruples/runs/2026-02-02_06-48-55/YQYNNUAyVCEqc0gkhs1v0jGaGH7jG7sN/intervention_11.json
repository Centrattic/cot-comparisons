But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier has been talking negatively about customers in Korean, not knowing the customer is Korean. The cashier made a comment about the customer after a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The cashier is making negative comments about customers, which is unprofessional. The customer is bilingual and didn't reveal their Korean identity, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese. The cashier's comments were offensive but in Korean, so the customer had to act when they understood the remarks.\n\nThe customer wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired. They're concerned about how the employees will react if they find out the customer is Korean. The main question is whether the customer is in the wrong for reporting the cashier.\n\nOn one hand, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. Employees shouldn't make derogatory remarks about customers, regardless of the language. The customer has a right to be treated with respect. The cashier's comment was not only unprofessional but also discriminatory, implying that the customer was being cheap by saving 50 cents and suggesting they should go back to Japan, which is a sensitive comment given the context of being in a Korean store.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer didn't correct the cashier's assumption. By not revealing their Korean identity, they allowed the cashier to continue the behavior. However, that might not be a valid defense because the cashier has a duty to maintain professionalism regardless of the customer's background. Also, the customer had a right to point out the pricing error and was justified in understanding the cashier's comments once they realized the cashier was speaking Korean.\n\nThe customer's intention is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier to lose her job. That's a reasonable approach\u2014addressing the issue professionally. The cashier's actions could affect the store's reputation and customer experience, so the customer isn't overstepping by bringing it up to the manager.\n\nConsidering all this, the cashier was wrong in her behavior, and the customer is in the right for reporting it. The customer isn't at fault here because they're standing up against unprofessional and potentially discriminatory remarks. The cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of the language used, and the customer has a responsibility to seek a resolution through proper channels.\n"
