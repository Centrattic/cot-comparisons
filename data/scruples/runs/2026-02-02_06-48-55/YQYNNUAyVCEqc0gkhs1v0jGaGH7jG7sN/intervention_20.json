But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier assumes they're Japanese because she speaks English to them. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the person can understand. The cashier's recent comment was pretty harsh, mentioning saving 50 cents and implying they should go back to Japan.\n\nThe person wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. They're worried about the cashier finding out they're Korean. Now, the question is whether the person is in the wrong for reporting.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if it's in Korean, if the store has a policy against harassment or disrespectful behavior, the person has a right to report it. The cashier's remarks included a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\") which is offensive and could be considered discriminatory. \n\nThe person is bilingual and understood the comments. By not speaking up before, they might have allowed the behavior to continue. However, the cashier's comment crossed a line with the racial aspect. Reporting it isn't just about the 50 cents but the racial slur, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe person isn't trying to get her fired but wants to address the behavior. Since the cashier's comments are in another language, the manager might not be aware. The person is in a position to bring it up because they can understand it. \n\nIs the person at fault? They tried to be understanding before but now the cashier targeted them with a racial comment. Reporting is a responsible action to prevent such behavior. The cashier should be held accountable if the store has anti-harassment policies. The person isn't in the wrong for standing up against discrimination, even if the cashier didn't know their background. So, the answer is B.\n"
