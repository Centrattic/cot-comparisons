But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering reporting the cashier. The scenario involves a Korean grocery store cashier who mumbles negative comments in Korean about customers, which the author, who is Korean but mistaken for Japanese, overhears. The cashier made a derogatory remark during a transaction when the author corrected a price. The author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was talking about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier's comments, while not highly offensive, included a rude remark when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior and wants to address it but not cause harm to the employee.\n\nNow, the author is bilingual and the cashier didn't know their identity. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, especially since it's directed at customers. Even if the cashier thought the customer was Japanese, making a comment about them being broke or suggesting they go back to Japan is inappropriate. The author is justified in feeling targeted and wanting to address the issue.\n\nThe question is whether reporting the cashier makes the author at fault. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The author is taking a stand against harassment, which is reasonable. Since the cashier's behavior is harmful and the author is not seeking to get her fired but to address the issue, the author is likely in the right. The cashier should be held accountable for her comments, which are not acceptable in a workplace. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
