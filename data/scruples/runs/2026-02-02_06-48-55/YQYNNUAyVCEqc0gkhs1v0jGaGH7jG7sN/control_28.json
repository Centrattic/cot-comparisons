But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to this Korean grocery store for a year. The cashier has been making derogatory remarks in Korean, which the author can understand, and recently targeted the author with comments about saving 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan. The author is bilingual but didn't correct the cashier's assumption, and now wants to report the behavior without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. The cashier was speaking negatively to customers in Korean, which others might not understand. However, the author does understand it, so it's clear the cashier is being rude. The cashier's comment about the author is clearly discriminatory, mentioning \"go back to Japan\" which is a racial slur. That's definitely not okay. \n\nBut the author didn't correct the cashier's assumption about their ethnicity. Was that a mistake? Maybe they had their reasons. Maybe they wanted to avoid confrontation or didn't want to out themselves. It's their right to decide when to reveal personal information. \n\nNow, the author wants to report the cashier, but not to get them fired. They're concerned about the cashier finding out their secret. The key here is whether the author has a right to report the behavior. The cashier's comments are harassment and discrimination, especially the part about \"go back to Japan.\" It's not just complaining; it's targeted at the customer. \n\nThe store has a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment for all customers. The author is a customer, and the cashier's behavior affected their experience and safety. Reporting it to the manager is reasonable. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to hold the employee accountable for harassment. \n\nBut maybe the author should have addressed it directly first? However, given that the cashier was speaking in Korean, others might not understand, so the manager might need to act. The author can explain the situation without necessarily outing themselves. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could affect other customers as well. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to report the harassment and discrimination they experienced. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and inappropriate, regardless of the language used. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to maliciously get the cashier fired. So the answer should be B, No."
