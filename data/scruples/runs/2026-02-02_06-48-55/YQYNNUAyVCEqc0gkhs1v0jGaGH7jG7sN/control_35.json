But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Korean person who's bilingual in English and Korean but looks Japanese. They go to a Korean grocery store where the employees speak English to them, assuming they're Japanese. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean towards customers, and the author recently experienced this when pointing out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the cashier was speaking Korean to others, which the author could understand because they're fluent. The cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean when the author corrected the price. The author is considering reporting this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. Let's break down the elements:\n\n1. **Harassment or Discrimination**: The cashier's comments, especially after the author corrected her, could be considered workplace harassment or customer mistreatment. Even if the comments are in another language, if the customer (who is fluent) is targeted, it's a problem. Employers usually have policies against such behavior.\n\n2. **Author's Intent**: The author is trying to address harassment without causing harm to the cashier. They don't want her fired, just to stop the behavior. That seems reasonable.\n\n3. **Employer's Responsibility**: Employers are responsible for ensuring a safe working environment for employees and a respectful experience for customers. The manager should be informed so they can address the issue, possibly through training or disciplinary action.\n\n4. **Author's Identification**: The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, which might explain the comments. However, the fact that she made a specific comment about \"going back to Japan\" is a clear issue of discrimination based on perceived nationality, which is wrong regardless of the cashier's knowledge.\n\n5. **Justification for Reporting**: The author has been a regular customer for a year, so this isn't a one-time incident. The cashier's behavior is consistent, and the recent incident was a direct attack. Reporting to the manager is a responsible step to prevent future harassment.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is acting in their own interest and the store's interest to address inappropriate behavior. The cashier's comments are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author isn't trying to get her fired but to stop the harmful behavior, which is a valid reason to report. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
