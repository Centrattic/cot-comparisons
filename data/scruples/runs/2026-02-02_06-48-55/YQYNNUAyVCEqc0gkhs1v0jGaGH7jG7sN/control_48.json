But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese and spoke English to them. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand, and made a derogatory comment when a pricing error happened.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong by reporting the cashier. The key points here are the cashier's behavior. The cashier was making negative remarks about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. Even though the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, the author is bilingual and overheard the comments. The cashier's remarks included a personal attack, implying the customer was trying to save money and should go back to Japan. That's pretty harsh, even if it's not the worst kind of harassment.\n\nNow, the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want them fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. Even if it's not a major offense, repeated behavior like this can create a hostile work environment for customers. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to take action, especially since they were the target of the comment.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The cashier might have been under stress, as mentioned before. But the author's intention is to report the behavior, not to cause harm. The author is also concerned about the cashier being fired, which shows they are trying to be fair. The cashier's actions crossed a line when they made a personal attack. The author didn't confront the cashier directly but chose to inform the manager, which is a reasonable step to address the issue without immediate escalation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical by reporting. They are addressing harassment they experienced. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a resolution. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
