But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, a language the author understands. \n\nFirst, the cashier didn't know the author is Korean, which is why she spoke in Korean. The author has been going to the store for a year and the employees assumed he's Japanese because of his appearance. The cashier's comments were negative but not extremely offensive\u2014just complaints about customers being demanding. However, the cashier did make a personal comment about the author when he pointed out a pricing error.\n\nNow, the author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. The key points here are: 1) the cashier was talking negatively about customers in a language she thought only she and others knew, 2) the author is bilingual and heard the comments, 3) the cashier made a direct, insulting comment towards the author, and 4) the author wants to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job.\n\nThe cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional. Even if it's not illegal, it's rude and creates a hostile work environment. The author has a right to feel disrespected, especially after the cashier made a personal attack. Reporting the behavior to the manager makes sense to address the issue, especially since the cashier might not realize the author understands Korean. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for reporting? The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to stop the negative talk. The manager should handle it appropriately, maybe through training or a warning. The cashier's comments could also affect other customers, even if they don't speak Korean. The manager has a responsibility to ensure employees maintain a professional demeanor. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. The cashier's behavior is the problem here, not the author seeking resolution.\n"
