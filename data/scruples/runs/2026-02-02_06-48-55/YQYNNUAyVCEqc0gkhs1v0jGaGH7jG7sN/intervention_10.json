But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier thought they were Japanese and spoke English to them. The cashier mumbled negative things in Korean, which the author overheard and understood. Then the cashier said something offensive after a pricing issue, and the author is considering reporting them but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. Talking negatively about customers, even in another language, is unprofessional. The cashier made offensive remarks, which could be considered harassment or discrimination. The author has a right to a respectful environment. But the cashier might have thought the author couldn't understand Korean, so maybe they didn't realize it was being heard.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier to lose her job. That's understandable because the cashier might not have known the author was Korean. The author isn't reporting out of malice but to address the negative comments. The cashier's comments could affect other customers too, even if the author is the one who understood them. \n\nHowever, the author is using their knowledge of Korean to catch the cashier in a way the cashier didn't expect. But the cashier was clearly being disrespectful, which is a problem regardless of the language used. The store's policy likely prohibits such behavior, so the author is within their rights to report it. The cashier's comments were directed at a customer, which is inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue professionally.\n"
