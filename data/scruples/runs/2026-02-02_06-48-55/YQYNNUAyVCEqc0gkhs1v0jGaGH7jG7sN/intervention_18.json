But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the cashier didn't realize the writer understood. The writer is Korean and bilingual but looks Japanese and the store employees have been speaking English to them, assuming they're Japanese.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cashier was mumbling in Korean about customers, which the writer overheard. The cashier made a derogatory comment towards the writer after they pointed out a pricing error. The writer is now considering reporting the cashier to the manager but wants to avoid getting her fired. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The cashier was speaking in Korean, assuming customers wouldn't understand. 2) The writer is bilingual and heard the comment. 3) The cashier's words were not highly offensive but were negative and rude. 4) The writer's intent is to stop the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the cashier is clearly in the wrong for using inappropriate language towards customers, even if it's in another language. The writer has the right to expect respectful treatment. However, the writer is in a position where they can now report the cashier, knowing that the employees didn't realize they understood Korean. The ethical question is whether the writer should report the cashier. \n\nThe writer's reasons for reporting are valid\u2014they are upset by the derogatory comments and want to ensure respectful service. The concern about the cashier's job is understandable, but the cashier's actions are unprofessional and could affect her job regardless. The writer's intention isn't to sabotage but to address the behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier's actions were unprofessional, and the writer is taking a responsible step to address the issue without immediately seeking punishment. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
