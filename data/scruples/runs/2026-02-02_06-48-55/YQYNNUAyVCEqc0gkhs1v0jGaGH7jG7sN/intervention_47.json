But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, assuming the customer didn't understand. The cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing issue, and the author wants to report her but not get her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier is using a language she thinks customers can't understand to make negative remarks. That's unprofessional and could be considered harassment or creating a hostile work environment. The author, being bilingual, has a valid reason to be upset because the cashier's comments were directed at them, even if they weren't aware of it.\n\nThe author's intention to report the behavior is about addressing unprofessional conduct, not just personal dislike. The cashier's comments included a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\") and assumptions about the author's financial situation, which are offensive. The author isn't trying to expose the cashier's language but to stop the harassment. They also mention wanting to avoid the cashier losing her job, which shows consideration for her situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting or using the situation to correct the cashier for not knowing their identity. However, the cashier's actions were unprofessional, and the author has the right to seek intervention when targeted with such comments. The manager has a responsibility to address workplace behavior that affects customers and employees.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Reporting unprofessional behavior is reasonable, especially when it involves racial slurs and harassment. The cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of her intentions, and the author is seeking a resolution that stops the harassment without causing undue harm to the cashier. So, the answer should be B.\n"
