But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is Korean but appears Japanese. They go to a Korean grocery store where the cashier assumes they're Japanese and communicates in English. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean, which the author understands, and now they want to report her because of the negative comments made towards them.\n\nFirst, the cashier was talking about customers in another language, which the author picked up on. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but were clearly negative and possibly discriminatory. The author is bilingual, so they could understand the cashier's remarks. The cashier made a specific comment towards the author after an incident where the author pointed out a pricing error. The cashier said something like telling the author to go back to Japan and implied they were cheap for saving 50 cents. \n\nNow, the author is conflicted about reporting this because they don't want the cashier to lose her job. They're worried that when the cashier finds out the author is actually Korean, she might be upset. But the author also feels that the cashier's behavior is inappropriate and wants to stop it.\n\nSo, from the cashier's perspective, she might not have realized that the author could understand Korean, so she was speaking freely in her native language. However, the cashier's words were directed at the author and were hurtful. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional and possibly discriminatory, especially if she was making assumptions about the author based on their appearance.\n\nThe author is in a position where they can understand the problem since they're bilingual. They have a right to feel offended by the cashier's remarks. Reporting the behavior to the manager is a reasonable step to take, especially if the cashier is making derogatory comments towards customers. The author's intention isn't to get the cashier fired but to stop the behavior, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting this. Since the cashier's actions were inappropriate and the author is able to understand them, the author is justified in wanting to address the issue. The cashier might argue that she didn't mean to target the author specifically, but the comment was directed at the author after they corrected the price, which makes it personal. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's behavior. The cashier should be held accountable for her unprofessional conduct, and the author is within their rights to seek a resolution without causing unnecessary harm to the cashier. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
