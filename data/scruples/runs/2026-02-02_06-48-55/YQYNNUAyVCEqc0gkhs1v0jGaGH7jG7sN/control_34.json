But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is Korean, bilingual in English and Korean, but looks Japanese and lives in a Japanese-populated area. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and employees assume they're Japanese because they speak English to them. The cashier in question has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, which the user has overlooked until recently.\n\nThe key event is when the cashier, after a pricing error, mumbled derogatory things in Korean, which the user understands. The user is now considering reporting her to the manager but wants to avoid getting her fired. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting this.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior: she's been making negative comments in another language, possibly thinking the customers don't understand. This could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially if the comments are about the customers' ethnicity or spending habits. The manager's role is to ensure a respectful environment for all customers and employees.\n\nThe user's right to report this is important. They were the target of the cashier's remarks and have the right to feel safe and respected. Since the user is Korean, they can understand the comments, which the cashier likely didn't realize. The user's intention isn't to get the cashier fired but to stop the behavior, which is reasonable.\n\nPotential issues: The user didn't mention confronting the cashier directly first. However, given the cashier's attitude (avoiding eye contact), a direct confrontation might not be effective. Reporting to the manager is appropriate to address the issue professionally. The manager should handle it without necessarily firing the employee if it's a case of poor judgment rather than malicious intent.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking to address the unprofessional behavior that targeted them. So the answer is B.\n"
