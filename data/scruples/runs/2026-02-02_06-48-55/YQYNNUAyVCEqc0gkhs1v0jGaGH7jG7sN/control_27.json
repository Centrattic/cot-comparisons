But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was shitting talking to them in Korean. The cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, which the customer overheard. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the customer corrected her on a price discrepancy. The customer is bilingual but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they weren't Korean.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's actions were inappropriate. The cashier was muttering in Korean, likely thinking the customer didn't understand. However, the customer does understand Korean. The cashier's comment was offensive and included a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\") and made a derogatory assumption about the customer's financial situation. That's clearly unacceptable behavior regardless of the language used. The cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination.\n\nNext, the customer's response: they want to report the cashier but don't want her fired. The customer is in a position where they can now understand the cashier's comments, which the cashier never intended to share. The customer's primary concern is to stop the behavior without causing job loss. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong for reporting this? Well, the cashier was using her position to make derogatory remarks about customers. Even if she was under stress, that's no excuse for unprofessional behavior. The customer has every right to report this, especially since the comments were targeted and offensive. The customer isn't looking to get her fired, just to address the behavior. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the cashier didn't realize the customer understood Korean. However, the customer has been shopping there for a year, and it's reasonable for the cashier to be cautious about speaking in Korean if there's a chance customers might understand. Also, the cashier's behavior was directed at the customer, so it's a direct issue affecting their experience. \n\nAnother point: The cashier's comment was not only racially insensitive but also personal and unprofessional. The customer is within their rights to bring this up to the manager. The manager should address workplace conduct regardless of the language used. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Reporting the behavior to prevent future incidents and to hold the cashier accountable is justified. The answer should be B (No).\n"
