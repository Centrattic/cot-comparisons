But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is Korean but looks Japanese and is bilingual. They go to a Korean grocery store where employees think they're Japanese. The cashier in question mumbles in Korean, which the author can understand, about customers. The cashier specifically insulted the author when they pointed out a price error, saying things like \"Why not go back to Japan\" and implying they're looking for sales because they're broke.\n\nThe author is considering reporting the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. The key points here are whether the cashier's behavior was inappropriate and if the author has a right to report it even though they were hiding their Korean identity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the cashier's remarks were discriminatory or harassing. The cashier used a slur or offensive language (the \"fucking\" part) and made a comment about the author's identity, suggesting they should go back to Japan. That's a racial or ethnic slur, which is definitely inappropriate. Even if it's in Korean, the content of the comment is offensive regardless of the language used. The cashier's job is to serve all customers professionally, and making derogatory remarks, especially based on race or ethnicity, is a violation of workplace conduct policies in most places.\n\nOn the author's side, they were in the store as a customer and pointed out a legitimate error. The cashier's response was not just a stress-related complaint but a personal attack. The author has every right to feel targeted and harassed. Even though the author was being discreet about their Korean identity, they are still a customer and deserve respectful treatment. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. If the cashier's behavior is discriminatory, then reporting it is a reasonable action. The author isn't trying to get her fired for minor things but to address harassment. The cashier's comments cross the line into personal attacks based on the author's perceived ethnicity, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe author is not at fault here. They are standing up against inappropriate behavior, which is a responsible action. The cashier's actions are the problem, not the author's reporting. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
