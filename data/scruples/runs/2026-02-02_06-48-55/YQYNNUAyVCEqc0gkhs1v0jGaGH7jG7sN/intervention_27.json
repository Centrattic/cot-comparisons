But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier always speaks English to her. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean, which the author can understand, and making negative comments about customers. The author didn't report it before, thinking maybe the cashier was just stressed, but now after an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, the author is considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier even made a comment implying that the customer should go back to Japan. That's offensive, even if it's not directed at the author personally. The cashier's job is to serve customers, and making negative comments, even in another language, is unprofessional.\n\nThe author didn't report it before because they thought the cashier was stressed. But the cashier's language crossed the line into being derogatory. The author is justified in wanting to report the behavior because it's unprofessional and hostile towards customers. However, the author is worried about the cashier losing her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting.\n\nThe cashier's actions are inappropriate regardless of the language. Customers have the right to be treated respectfully. The author's intent is to address the behavior, not get the cashier fired. The author is considering the consequences for the cashier, which shows they're not malicious. So, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's unprofessional conduct. The answer should be B (No).\n"
