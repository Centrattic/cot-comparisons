But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she was speaking in Korean, which the author could understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumbling in Korean, which might not be immediately apparent to others, but the author heard her. She made a derogatory comment towards the customer, using a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\") and implying the customer was being cheap. That's clearly inappropriate and could be considered harassment or discrimination.\n\nNow, the author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier fired. They're concerned about the cashier's reaction if she finds out the author is Korean. The author's motivation is to stop the behavior without causing harm. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was being rude and unprofessional. The author has the right to report harassment. Since the author is bilingual, they can understand the comments, which others might not. The cashier's comments are not just stress-related but targeted towards a customer based on their perceived ethnicity. \n\nBut the author is using their knowledge (being Korean) to expose the cashier, which might be a double standard if others can't hear the Korean comments. However, the cashier's actions were wrong regardless of who hears them. The author isn't fabricating something; they're reporting actual harassment. \n\nAlso, the cashier's comment included a racial slur, which is a serious issue. The author's intention is to address the behavior, not to retaliate. They don't want the cashier fired, just to stop the behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing harassment and seeking a resolution without seeking punishment beyond stopping the behavior. The cashier was unprofessional and discriminatory. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
