But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to this Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, has been mumbling negative comments in Korean during checkouts. The author recently caught the cashier making a specific comment about them when a pricing error occurred. Now, they want to report the cashier but don't want her fired.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for reporting this. Let's break it down. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier's comments were rude, even if not overtly offensive. The author, being bilingual, had the ability to hear these comments but chose to ignore them initially. However, after the cashier made a personal comment towards the author, they decided to take action.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the cashier was unprofessional, making negative remarks about customers, even if in another language. Employees are expected to maintain a professional demeanor regardless of the language they use. The author has the right to a respectful service and might feel violated by being targeted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking advantage of the cashier's assumption that they don't understand Korean. By not revealing their identity, the author might have intentionally or unintentionally kept the cashier unaware. Reporting the cashier could lead to job loss, and the author might be overstepping by using their hidden knowledge. \n\nThe cashier's comments were not only about customers in general but specifically targeted the author after an incident. This personal attack complicates things. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without firing the cashier, which shows they're not trying to be vindictive. \n\nWorkplace policies usually prohibit harassment and discriminatory behavior. If the cashier's comments were considered harassment, the author has a duty to report it. However, if the store's policy is that employees should not talk negatively in any language, the author is reporting a legitimate issue. \n\nAnother angle: The cashier might not realize that the author understands Korean. If the cashier was only speaking in Korean, thinking customers wouldn't understand, it's a breach of professional conduct. The author's decision to report is about maintaining a respectful environment, not just personal grievance.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the cashier's intent. If the remarks were general complaints and not targeted, then the author might be taking it personally. However, the cashier did directly address the author in the recent incident, which is a clear violation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employer should ensure that employees treat customers respectfully, regardless of the language. The author is acting as a whistleblower, which is generally encouraged if done responsibly. They want to make a change without harming the cashier's job, which is a balanced approach.\n\nPotential issues: The author might be exposing the cashier to consequences she didn't anticipate, but the author is not malicious. The cashier's behavior could be affecting other customers too, even if the author is the only one who reports it.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems the author is not in the wrong. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful, and the author is taking a responsible step to address it without being vindictive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
