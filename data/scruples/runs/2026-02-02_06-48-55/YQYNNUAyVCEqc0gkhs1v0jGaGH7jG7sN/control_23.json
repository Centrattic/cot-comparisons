But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Korean grocery store cashier who's been making negative comments in Korean towards customers, assuming the customers don't understand. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize they understand Korean. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. Now the author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, thinking the customers wouldn't understand. That's probably rude and unprofessional. The author, being bilingual, heard the comments and wants to address it. The cashier's comment included a racial slur, suggesting the author go back to Japan, which is offensive. \n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior but not get the cashier fired. They might be worried about the cashier's reaction if she finds out the author is Korean. The question is whether the author is at fault for reporting this.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the cashier was making negative comments towards customers, even if in another language, it's still unprofessional and could be considered harassment or discrimination. The employer should be aware of such behavior because it affects customer experience and creates a hostile environment. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to take action. However, the cashier might not be aware that the author understood her comments. \n\nBut the author did let previous instances pass, thinking it was job stress. However, the recent incident where the cashier targeted the author with a racial comment is more offensive. Reporting the behavior to the manager is a reasonable step to prevent it from happening to others, even if it's done discreetly. The author isn't looking to cause harm but to improve the work environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using their knowledge of Korean to take action that the cashier didn't anticipate. The cashier might not have intended for anyone to hear, but the author is within their rights to address the harassment. The employer has a responsibility to ensure employees treat customers respectfully, regardless of language spoken. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the unprofessional and offensive behavior. The cashier's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
