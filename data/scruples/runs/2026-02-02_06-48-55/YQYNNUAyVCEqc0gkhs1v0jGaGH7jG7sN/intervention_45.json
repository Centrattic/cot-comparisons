But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier in question mumbled in Korean, which the author can understand, and made a derogatory comment. The author is Korean but was mistaken as Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize they could understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of reporting someone for something they didn't know the listener could understand. The cashier was talking about customers in her own language, which might be a common practice in some workplaces. However, the comment she made was offensive, even if it wasn't directed at the author specifically. The author is bilingual, so they can understand the criticism, which the cashier didn't realize. \n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional. Even if she didn't know the author was Korean, making negative remarks about customers, especially in a way that's derogatory (like suggesting they should \"go back to Japan\"), is inappropriate. The author wants to report her but not get her fired, which is a valid concern. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this action.\n\nAnother angle is the cashier's intent. She might have been venting stress, which is understandable, but the content of her remarks was offensive. The author's decision to report this could be seen as necessary to stop unprofessional behavior. On the flip side, since the cashier didn't know the author understood, maybe the author could have addressed it directly instead of going to management. But the cashier's comment was directed at the author, even if indirectly, so the impact is real.\n\nAlso, the author's identity being mistaken as Japanese played a role here. The cashier's comment about going back to Japan implies a racial or ethnic slur, which is clearly problematic. The author has a right to feel offended and seek a resolution without wanting the cashier to lose her job. \n\nIn summary, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and offensive, especially the racial comment. The author's intention to report to ensure it stops is justified. Even though the cashier didn't know the author could understand, the content of her remarks is inappropriate regardless. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this.\n"
