But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, assuming the author is Japanese because of their appearance. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the author is Korean and has been hiding their language ability. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful, making the author uncomfortable. The author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want them fired. \n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was speaking negatively about customers in another language, which the author understood. The cashier's comment when corrected was hostile. The author is considering reporting this, but there's a twist because they've been hiding their identity. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier's actions were inappropriate. The author has the right to feel disrespected. However, the author intentionally kept their Korean identity hidden. By doing so, they might have allowed the cashier to speak freely in Korean, knowing that the cashier assumed they didn't understand. \n\nBut the cashier's comments were directed at customers in general, not just the author. However, when the author corrected the price, the cashier made a personal attack. The author is justified in feeling targeted. \n\nThe author's intention to report is to stop the behavior, not to get the cashier fired. The question is whether the author should have intervened themselves earlier. The cashier was already mumbling in Korean before, and the author let it pass. Now, after the direct insult, they want to report it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not speaking up earlier? Maybe, but the cashier didn't realize the author understood Korean. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional regardless. The author has a right to report harassment or unprofessional conduct. \n\nSo, the cashier is in the wrong for the behavior, and the author isn't in the wrong for reporting it. The fact that the author is Korean might be a factor in the cashier's shock, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting to address the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
