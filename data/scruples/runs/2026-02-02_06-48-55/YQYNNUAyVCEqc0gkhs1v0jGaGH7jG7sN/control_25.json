But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they didn't understand Korean. The cashier made offensive remarks in Korean, and the author heard them because they're bilingual. Now the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The cashier was making derogatory comments towards customers, which is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. Even if it's in another language, the author has a right to a respectful shopping experience. Since the author is bilingual and understood the comments, they have valid grounds to report the behavior.\n\nThe cashier's remarks included offensive language and a suggestion to \"go back to Japan,\" which could be considered a form of discrimination or harassment. The manager needs to be aware of this to address the issue. The author is concerned about the cashier getting fired, but the main issue is the inappropriate behavior. The author isn't seeking revenge; they just want the behavior to stop. So, reporting it is a responsible action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
