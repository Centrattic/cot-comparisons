But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author could understand because he's bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, thinking he was Japanese. The cashier made a rude comment after the author pointed out a pricing error. Now the author wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumbling in another language, which is common in many workplaces, but the author could understand it. The cashier's comments were about customers being difficult, and the recent incident involved a direct insult. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior but is also worried about her job.\n\nThe author's intentions here are to address the issue without causing the cashier to lose her job. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional, especially if it's directed at customers, even if in another language. However, the cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, so the insult was unintended. The author is in a position where he can understand the comments, which others might not. \n\nIs the author obligated to stay silent to protect the cashier? Or is it his right to report unprofessional behavior? The cashier's actions could create a hostile environment for customers who can understand her. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to address this, especially since he's a customer and experienced the direct insult. The manager should be informed about the unprofessional conduct, regardless of the language used. The author's concern about the cashier's job is considerate, but the issue is about the cashier's behavior affecting the customer experience. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional, and the author has the right to bring it up to the manager. The answer should be B.\n"
