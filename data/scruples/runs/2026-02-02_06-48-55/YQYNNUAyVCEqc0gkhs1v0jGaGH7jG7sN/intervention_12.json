But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author is Korean, so she spoke Korean, which the author understands. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier was mumbling in Korean, assuming customers didn't understand. The author, being bilingual, heard it. The cashier's comment wasn't overtly offensive but included a racial slur, suggesting the author should go back to Japan and implying they're always looking for sales. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was doing her job, the author's right to feel disrespected, and the potential consequences for the cashier. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional, using a racial slur. The author has a right to report harassment or discrimination. However, the author is hiding their identity, which might complicate things. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so the comment was specifically targeting the author based on perceived ethnicity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the cashier was indeed being racist, the author is justified in reporting. However, the cashier might not be aware she's being rude to the author. The author could have addressed it directly first. But since the cashier used a slur, that's a serious issue regardless. The author's intent isn't to get her fired but to stop the behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
