But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Korean grocery store cashier who talks negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because he's bilingual. The cashier's comments weren't super offensive but included some personal attacks. The author is considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumbling in Korean, which the author could understand, and made a derogatory comment when there was a pricing error. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional, especially since she's an employee and was talking about customers, which could be considered harassment or a toxic work environment for her. \n\nThe author's intent is to report the cashier but not get her fired. He's in a position where he can understand her comments because of his bilingualism. The cashier didn't know he's Korean, so she might feel more comfortable speaking negatively in her own language. However, making derogatory remarks about a customer, even if in another language, is unprofessional and could be a form of discrimination or harassment. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for reporting? Well, he's trying to address inappropriate behavior. Companies usually have policies against harassment, regardless of the language. The cashier's comments were directed at a customer, which is a form of discrimination if based on nationality or origin. The author isn't trying to start trouble but wants the behavior to stop. Since the cashier's actions were unprofessional, reporting is a valid step. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? For example, confronting the cashier directly or talking to the manager in a way that protects her job. However, the author's approach is to report the issue without wanting her fired, so he's being considerate. \n\nThe cashier's comment about the author's nationality is particularly problematic. Saying \"Why not go back to Japan\" is a racial slur and could be legally actionable. The author has a right to a safe and respectful shopping environment. Reporting this to the manager is a reasonable response. \n\nIn conclusion, the cashier's behavior was unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author is not in the wrong for seeking to address this. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
