But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but the cashier thought they were Japanese, so the cashier would speak English to them. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand, and made a derogatory comment after a pricing issue. The author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is that they want to address the cashier's behavior without causing her to lose her job. The cashier was speaking in Korean, assuming the customer didn't understand, but the author does. The cashier made a comment about the customer being cheap and telling them to go back to Japan. That's pretty rude, even if it's in Korean. But since the author is Korean, the cashier didn't know they could understand. The author is in a situation where they feel targeted, even though they're ethnically Korean but perceived as Japanese.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting this? Well, the cashier was being disrespectful to customers, which is a problem. The author is trying to address it by informing the manager. But the cashier might not realize the customer understood. The author's intention isn't to get her fired but to stop the behavior. So maybe the author is right to report it because the cashier's actions are unprofessional and could affect customer relations. Alternatively, maybe the author overreacted because they took the comment personally, but the comment was still inappropriate regardless of the language used. \n\nThe cashier's behavior is unprofessional, and the author has a right to report it without wanting the cashier fired. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate issue with the cashier's behavior and are seeking a resolution. The cashier should be held accountable, but the author's approach seems reasonable. The key is that the cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it without harsh consequences. So I think the answer is B.\n"
