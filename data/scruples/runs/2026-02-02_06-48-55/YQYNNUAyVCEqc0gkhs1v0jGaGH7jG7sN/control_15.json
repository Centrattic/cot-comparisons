But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier has been making rude comments in Korean, which the author, being Korean bilingual, can understand. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean because they look Japanese. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's making negative remarks about customers in another language, which might be a way to vent stress, but it's still unprofessional. The author heard her and decided to let it go at first, but after an incident where the cashier directly insulted them, they want to report it.\n\nThe author is in a tricky situation because they don't want the cashier to lose her job. They're concerned about her reaction if she finds out the author is Korean. The main point is whether the author is justified in reporting the cashier despite the potential consequences.\n\nWorkplace harassment policies usually state that employees shouldn't engage in negative behavior towards customers. If the cashier is speaking negatively about customers, even in another language, it could be considered unprofessional and against company policy. The author isn't just reporting out of spite; they have a specific instance where they were targeted. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the cashier not knowing the author's true identity. If the store employees thought the author was Japanese, then the cashier's comments might not have been directed at the author's ethnicity, but the content still includes a racial slur. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to cause harm to the cashier's job. \n\nSo, the author is trying to address unprofessional conduct without causing undue harm. The cashier's actions are inappropriate regardless of language, so reporting it aligns with maintaining a respectful environment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to address the issue.\n"
