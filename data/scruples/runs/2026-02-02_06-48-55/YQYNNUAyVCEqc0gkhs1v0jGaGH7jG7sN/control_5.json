But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, not realizing the customer is Korean.\n\nFirst, the cashier was mumbling in Korean, which the employees assumed the customer couldn't understand because they looked Japanese. The cashier made a derogatory comment about the customer during a transaction error. The customer is bilingual and heard her.\n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was disrespectful, using a language she thought the customer wouldn't understand. The customer wants to report this behavior without getting her fired. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially if she's making assumptions based on appearance.\n\nThe customer isn't trying to get the cashier fired just for being negative; they want the behavior to stop. Since the cashier's comments were about the customer's shopping habits and savings, it's personal and unprofessional. The customer has a right to address harassment or unprofessional conduct, even if it's in another language. \n\nThe cashier's actions might also violate workplace policies against harassment or creating a hostile environment. The customer's intent is to report the behavior, not to cause harm to the cashier's job unless the manager decides that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the incident.\n"
