But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she was mumbling in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author after a pricing issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was being unprofessional, using offensive language towards customers, even if it was in Korean. The author, being bilingual, understood the insult. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially inappropriate, regardless of the language used. The author's intent is to report the behavior, not to get the cashier fired, just to stop the negative talk.\n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment if the comments were directed at customers. Companies usually have policies against such behavior. The author has a right to a respectful service experience. However, the author is taking advantage of the cashier's mistaken assumption about their ethnicity. But the cashier's actions are still wrong regardless of the author's identity.\n\nThe author isn't trying to expose the cashier's mistake but to address the unprofessional behavior. The cashier's comment was both unprofessional and offensive. The author is in a position to report the behavior without revealing their Korean identity, which might protect the cashier from losing her job but also hold her accountable.\n\nThe key points are: the cashier's actions are unprofessional and inappropriate; the author is reporting to address the behavior, not to retaliate; and the author is not trying to cause harm beyond stopping the negative talk. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's behavior.\n"
