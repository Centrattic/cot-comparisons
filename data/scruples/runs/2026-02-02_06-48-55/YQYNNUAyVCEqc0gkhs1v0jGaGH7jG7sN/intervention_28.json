But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a Korean grocery store cashier who mumbles negative comments in Korean about customers, thinking the customer is Japanese. The author, who is Korean but appears Japanese, is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year. The cashier recently made a derogatory comment towards the author, and the author is considering reporting her to the manager.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's been making negative remarks in another language, possibly thinking the customers don't understand. The author heard her because they're bilingual. That's a key point. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, even if it's not directed at the author personally. The comment about the natto price discrepancy escalated things, especially since the cashier made a personal attack, suggesting the author go back to Japan.\n\nThe author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired. There's a concern that employees might be shocked to learn the author is Korean. The author is in a dilemma between addressing the unprofessional behavior and the potential fallout for the cashier.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the author's identity. The author is a customer and has the right to feel disrespected. By reporting the behavior, the author is taking a stand against unprofessional conduct. However, there's a nuance here because the cashier didn't know the author was Korean. But the cashier's actions are still unprofessional and could be discriminatory, especially the comment about returning to Japan, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nThe author's intention is to stop the behavior without causing harm to the cashier. Reporting to the manager is a reasonable step to ensure a respectful environment for all customers. The cashier's actions could affect other customers too, not just the author. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this. The cashier's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision to report it.\n"
