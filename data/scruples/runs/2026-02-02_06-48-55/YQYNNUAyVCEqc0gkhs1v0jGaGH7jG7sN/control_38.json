But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she was musing in Korean, which the author could understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was making negative comments in Korean, which the author understood. The cashier was being disrespectful towards customers, even if it wasn't highly offensive. The author tried to let it go initially but then had an incident where the cashier specifically targeted them with a comment about saving 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan. That's pretty harsh, even if it's in Korean. \n\nThe author is bilingual and the cashier didn't know they were Korean, so the cashier felt safe to say those things. The author is now considering reporting the cashier but doesn't want her fired. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to report this.\n\nOn one hand, the cashier was being rude and making customers uncomfortable. The author has a right to feel disrespected and wants to address the behavior. On the other hand, the cashier might not have realized the comments were offensive, especially since she's in a stressful job. However, the cashier's actions were intentional in making negative remarks, even if in another language. \n\nThe author is in a position to point out the behavior without causing immediate termination, maybe to protect the cashier's job. But the fact that the cashier spoke negatively in front of customers, regardless of the language, could be considered unprofessional. The manager should be informed because it's part of their responsibility to maintain a respectful workplace and customer environment.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a valid reason to report the inappropriate behavior, especially since it targeted them personally. The cashier's comments were unprofessional and discriminatory, even if not in English. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not necessarily to fire the cashier. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
