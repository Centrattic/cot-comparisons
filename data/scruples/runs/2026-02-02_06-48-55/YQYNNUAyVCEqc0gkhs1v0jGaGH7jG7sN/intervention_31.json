But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, thinking the author wouldn't understand. The cashier even made a rude comment about the author going back to Japan, which hurt the author.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if she didn't know the author was Korean, she was using her job to complain about customers, which is inappropriate. The manager should be informed about the behavior because it affects customer experience and could create a hostile work environment. However, the author is worried about the cashier getting fired. The author's intention isn't to harm the cashier but to stop the behavior. Since the cashier didn't intend to target the author, the manager can address it without firing her. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this; they're standing up for themselves and preventing future issues. So, the answer is B.\n"
