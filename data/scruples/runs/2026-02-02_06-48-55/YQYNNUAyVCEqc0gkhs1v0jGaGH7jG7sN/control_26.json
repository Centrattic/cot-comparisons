But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the customer was Korean because she looked Japanese, so the cashier was mumbling in Korean, which the customer could understand.\n\nFirst, the cashier was making negative comments about customers, which is unprofessional. The customer tried to ignore it before, thinking it was stress-related. But then the cashier directly insulted the customer, even though she didn't know she was Korean. The customer wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nThe key points here are the cashier's behavior: she was using a language she thought the customer didn't understand to complain, but that's still unprofessional. The customer is bilingual and heard the insults. Reporting the behavior to the manager is about addressing unprofessional conduct, not just the content of the comments. The customer's intention is to stop the behavior, not to get her fired. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report it. The cashier's actions are inappropriate regardless of the language used. So the answer should be B.\n"
