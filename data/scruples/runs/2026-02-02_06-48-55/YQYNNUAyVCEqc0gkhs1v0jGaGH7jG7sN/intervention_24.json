But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The person is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumes they're Japanese and speaks English. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, which the author noticed but let slide until a recent incident where the cashier directly insulted them in Korean, which the author understood. Now the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nHmm. The cashier was being rude to customers, which is unprofessional. The author is bilingual and heard the insults. Even though the cashier thought the customer wasn't Korean, the author was actually a Korean speaker all along. So, the cashier was being disrespectful, and the author wants to address it. But maybe the author shouldn't report because it's between the cashier and the customer? Or is it right to report because it's harassment?\n\nThe cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The author has the right to a respectful environment. Reporting it to the manager is reasonable. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but wants the behavior to stop. Since the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, she might have thought she was safe. The author's decision to report is about addressing the inappropriate behavior, not exposing the cashier. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
