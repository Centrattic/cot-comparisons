But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was making derogatory comments in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize they were Korean. The cashier mumbled negative comments about customers in Korean, which the author overheard because they're bilingual. The situation escalated when the cashier made a comment to the author after a pricing issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was talking negatively about customers in another language, which might be something the store should address. Even if others couldn't hear, the author could understand. The cashier's comments include \"Why not go back to Japan...\" which is a bit of a racial slur, implying the customer doesn't belong. That's offensive regardless of the language used.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior but not have the cashier fired. They're concerned about the employees finding out they're Korean, which adds a layer of complexity. The question is whether the author is right to report. \n\nFrom a policy standpoint, if the store has rules against harassment or negative language towards customers, the author is justified in reporting. The cashier's comments crossed into harassment, especially with the \"go back to Japan\" part. The author isn't making false accusations; they have a legitimate reason to report the behavior. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and discriminatory, even if in another language. The store should handle employee conduct, regardless of the language used. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed it directly with the cashier, but since the cashier was in denial (looking at the author but avoiding eye contact), that might not be effective. The author's concern about the cashier's job security is understandable, but the issue is the cashier's behavior, not the author's intent. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The answer should be B.\n"
