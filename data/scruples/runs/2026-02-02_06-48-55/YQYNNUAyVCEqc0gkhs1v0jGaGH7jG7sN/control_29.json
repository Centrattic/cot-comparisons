But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean because they look Japanese. The cashier made a mistake in pricing and then mumbled something negative in Korean when confronted. The author wants to report the behavior but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The cashier was using another language to complain about customers, which the author could understand. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but included some negative remarks, like suggesting the customer go back to Japan and implying they're cheap. Now, the author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year without revealing their Korean identity. The cashier, thinking the customer is Japanese, uses Korean to complain, which the author catches.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in reporting the cashier. On one hand, the cashier is speaking negatively about customers, which is unprofessional. On the other hand, the author is taking advantage of a situation where they used their Korean language skills to overhear private complaints that the cashier didn't intend for the customer to hear. \n\nWorkplace policies often prohibit employees from harassing or disrespecting customers. If the cashier's comments were indeed unprofessional or harassing, the author has a right to report it. However, the cashier might have believed the author was Japanese, so maybe the comments weren't targeted at Koreans but at all non-Korean customers. The author's decision to come forward could be seen as ethically correct because they're addressing unprofessional behavior, even if it was in another language. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The cashier might not have known the author was Korean, so the context changes. The author could argue that the cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used. However, the cashier didn't realize the author's identity, so it's not a case of direct discrimination. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without causing harm to the cashier's job. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, it's their right to feel disrespected and to report unprofessional conduct. The cashier's comments were in a language she thought the customer wouldn't understand, but since the customer did understand, reporting it makes sense. The manager should be informed to address the behavior without immediately firing someone, perhaps through training or warnings. \n\nThe author isn't trying to cause trouble but wants the behavior to stop. They might be worried about the cashier's reaction upon finding out, but the manager should handle that. The author's actions seem justified because they're protecting their own dignity and ensuring fair treatment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's unprofessional behavior, especially since they can prove the cashier spoke negatively about customers. The key here is that the cashier's actions crossed a line, and the author is acting in their own right to address it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
