But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier, thinking the customer is Japanese, has been talking negatively about customers in Korean, including making offensive comments towards the customer when they pointed out a price error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been mistaken for Japanese, so the cashier speaks English to them. The cashier has a habit of mumbled complaints in Korean, which the author, being bilingual, can understand. The key incident was when the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author heard, leading to their decision to report her. The author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired, and they\u2019re concerned about the employees finding out they're Korean.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The cashier's behavior is the main issue here. Even though the cashier didn't intend to target the author specifically, the comment made towards the author was offensive. The cashier's actions involve harassment or unprofessional behavior, which is against workplace standards. The author has a right to a respectful environment and is not in the wrong for addressing this.\n\nAnother point to consider is the author's intent. They want to report the cashier not for revenge but because they're being harassed. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could affect other customers as well. The author is taking a stand against harassment without the intent to cause harm beyond what's necessary. The fact that they're worried about the cashier getting fired shows they're considerate, but the priority is their right to be treated respectfully.\n\nThe cashier's actions might also be a sign of a larger issue in the workplace, such as a lack of training or a toxic environment. The author reporting it could lead to improvements in how employees treat customers. The author's decision to report is justified as a means to protect themselves and others from similar treatment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking appropriate action against harassment and seeking a resolution that doesn't necessarily lead to the cashier's termination. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
