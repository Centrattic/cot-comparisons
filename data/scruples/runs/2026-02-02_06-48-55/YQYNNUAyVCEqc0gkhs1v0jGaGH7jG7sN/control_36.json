But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, has been mumbling negative things in Korean during checkouts. The author didn't say anything before because they thought maybe the cashier was stressed. But then, after an incident where the cashier made a pricing error and the author corrected it, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood. Now the author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for reporting this? \n\nLet me think about possible angles. The cashier was using a language the customer understood to make derogatory remarks. Even if the cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, the author did understand and was offended. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The author is bilingual and the cashier's comments were directed at customers, which could create a hostile environment. \n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's behavior, which might be against company policy. Reporting it isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the company has policies against harassment or disrespectful behavior. The author also wants to avoid getting the cashier fired, so they might be approaching it constructively. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that the cashier didn't know the customer's true identity, so it's not intentional. However, the cashier's comments were made in a language the customer understood, so regardless of the cashier's assumption, the behavior was directed at the customer and was offensive. \n\nIn workplace ethics, employees are expected to treat customers respectfully. Even if the cashier thought the customer was Japanese, the remarks were still inappropriate. The author had a right to correct the pricing, and the cashier's response was unprofessional. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the behavior to the manager. The key points are the unprofessional conduct, the offensive language directed at the customer, and the author's intent to address it without causing harm to the cashier. So the answer is B (No).\n"
