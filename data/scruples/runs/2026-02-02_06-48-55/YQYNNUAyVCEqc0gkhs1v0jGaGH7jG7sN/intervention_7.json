But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author is Korean but looks Japanese and is bilingual. They go to a Korean grocery store where employees probably assume they're Japanese because they speak English. The cashier often mumbles in Korean, which the author realizes is negative talk about customers. The cashier even said something offensive after a pricing issue. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The cashier was using another language to talk negatively, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so maybe she thought she was being discreet.\n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's behavior and wants to address it without causing her job loss. The cashier's comments were rude, even if not highly offensive. The author has a valid reason to report this because the cashier was being disrespectful to customers. However, the author is worried about the cashier's reaction if she found out the author is Korean.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the cashier was wrong for talking negatively about customers, even if in another language. The author has a right to report inappropriate behavior at work, especially when it affects the customer experience. The author isn't trying to get her fired but wants the behavior to stop. So, the author is acting responsibly by reporting, not being in the wrong. The cashier's actions are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
