But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was being rude in Korean, which they didn't realize the cashier didn't know they could understand. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The employees assume they're Japanese because they speak English. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean, which the author can understand, and recently said something unpleasant when a price error happened. The author is now considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. They provided the context and asked for a decision between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, the key points here are: the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. Even though the cashier thought the customer couldn't understand, making derogatory remarks about a customer's background (like telling them to go back to Japan) is inappropriate. The author is bilingual and can understand the remarks, which adds a layer of complexity. \n\nNow, the author is conflicted about reporting because they don't want the cashier fired. But the cashier's comments could be considered harassment or discrimination, especially since they targeted the customer's ethnicity. The author has a right to a respectful service environment. \n\nIn terms of workplace policies, most companies have guidelines against discriminatory or harassing behavior towards customers. If the cashier is making such comments, the manager should be informed. The author isn't the one being unprofessional; the cashier is. The author is acting to protect their own rights and the store's standards. \n\nHowever, there's a consideration of whether the author is overreacting. But given that the cashier's remarks included ethnic slurs and personal attacks, it's not just a minor issue. The author is justified in wanting to address this. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for reporting this behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially illegal, so the author has a valid reason to report her without wanting her fired, perhaps leading to disciplinary action rather than termination. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n"
