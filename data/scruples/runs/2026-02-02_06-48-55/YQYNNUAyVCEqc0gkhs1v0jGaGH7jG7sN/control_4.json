But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier assumed they were Japanese, so spoke English. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author overheard, and then there was an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to report the manager but doesn't want the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author understood. The cashier did make a personal attack in the incident. The author is bilingual and has a valid reason to be upset. Reporting the behavior is about workplace conduct. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired just for the comments but wants the behavior to stop. The cashier's comments could be considered unprofessional or even discriminatory. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address the issue, especially since it's affecting their experience. The cashier's comments might also be against company policy if they're discriminatory. The author is being cautious not to cause harm beyond reporting the behavior. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
