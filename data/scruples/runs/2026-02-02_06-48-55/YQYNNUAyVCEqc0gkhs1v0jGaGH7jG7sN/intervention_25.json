But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author understood. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, thinking the customers wouldn't understand. The author, being bilingual, overheard and now wants to report her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was mumbling in another language, possibly thinking the customers wouldn't understand. But the author understood her. The cashier made a derogatory comment after the author pointed out a pricing error. The author is considering reporting this behavior but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nIs the author wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was being unprofessional. Even if she was speaking in another language, she was still expressing negative opinions about customers, which can be considered harassment or unprofessional conduct. The author has a right to a respectful service. However, the cashier might not have intended to be heard, so the author could have confronted her directly first. But since the cashier didn't know the author understood Korean, maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they can understand the cashier's comments, which others might not. So reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do to prevent others from experiencing similar treatment. However, the author might be overstepping by not giving the cashier a chance to explain or correct her behavior first. But since the cashier was talking in another language, maybe the manager wouldn't have been aware otherwise.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their bilingualism to take action that others can't. Is that fair? Or is it justified because the behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used? Also, the cashier's comment about the author going back to Japan is offensive and could be considered discriminatory. Reporting this might be necessary to address the harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be causing unnecessary trouble for the cashier. But the cashier's behavior is unprofessional, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it. The key here is that the cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is trying to rectify it without wanting to fire the cashier. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
