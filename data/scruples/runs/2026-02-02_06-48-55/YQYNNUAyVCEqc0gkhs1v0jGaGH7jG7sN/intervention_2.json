But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but others assume she's Japanese because of her appearance and where she lives. The cashier has been making derogatory remarks in Korean, which the author can understand. The cashier specifically insulted the author after a pricing issue, telling her to go back to Japan and implying she's broke. Now the author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is asking for another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's mumbled negative comments about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because she's bilingual. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional, especially since she used offensive language and targeted a specific customer. The cashier's remark about the author going back to Japan is a racial comment, which is definitely inappropriate in a workplace setting and could be considered discriminatory or offensive.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior but not have the cashier fired. The author is concerned about the cashier being aware that the author is actually Korean, which could lead to the cashier being surprised or upset. However, the author is not looking to cause harm beyond stopping the inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for reporting this? The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The author has a right to report harassment or discriminatory remarks in the workplace. The cashier's comments could create a hostile work environment or be considered discriminatory towards Asian communities, especially with the racial slur. The author is taking a stand against such behavior, which is generally seen as the right thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have had a bad day, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. The author might be overreacting if the cashier's remarks were not clearly offensive. However, in this case, the cashier's words included a racial comment, which is a serious issue. The author is not just reporting based on hearsay but has direct evidence of the cashier's offensive language.\n\nThe author's desire to report without causing the cashier to lose her job shows consideration, which is commendable. The key here is whether the cashier's actions cross the line into harassment or discrimination. If the remarks are consistently negative and include racial slurs, it's justified to report them to the manager.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to address the inappropriate behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, so reporting is a reasonable course of action.\n"
