But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but is mistaken for Japanese due to appearance. The cashier, thinking the customer is Japanese, mumbles in Korean, complaining about customers. The author overhears some offensive remarks and wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, consider the cashier's actions. She's using a language she thinks the customer doesn't understand, but the customer is actually fluent. The cashier's comments are disrespectful and potentially offensive, even if not directed at the author directly. The recent incident where the cashier made a snide comment in Korean, implying the author was cheap and should go back to Japan, crosses a line. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be discriminatory.\n\nThe author's intent is to report the behavior without wanting to fire the cashier. They want the manager to address the issue. The key here is whether the author has a right to report unprofessional conduct they were subjected to, especially when the cashier didn't realize the customer understood Korean. \n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination based on nationality. The author, as a customer, has the right to a respectful experience. By reporting the incident, the author is bringing attention to inappropriate behavior that might not be caught otherwise. Since the cashier was unaware the customer understood Korean, her comments could be seen as more malicious, as she felt secure in her language choice. \n\nThe author isn't retaliating out of malice but rather wanting to stop the behavior. The store management has a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment for all customers. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The answer should be B.\n"
