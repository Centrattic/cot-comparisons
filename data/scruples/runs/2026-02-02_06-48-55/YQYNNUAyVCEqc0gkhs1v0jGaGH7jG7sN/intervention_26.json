But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the user is Japanese, has been mumbling negative things in Korean during checkout. Recently, the cashier made a racist comment when the user pointed out a pricing error. Now the user wants to report the cashier but is worried about her getting fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior involves offensive comments in another language, which could be discriminatory. The user is bilingual and heard the remarks despite the cashier assuming they wouldn't understand. The cashier's comment about the user being Japanese and possibly poor is clearly derogatory. \n\nThe user's intention is to report the behavior to the manager to stop the harassment, not to get her fired. Since the cashier doesn't know the user is Korean, there's a hidden bias here. The user is in a position to address the issue without exposing the cashier's mistake, which could lead to unfair consequences. \n\nHowever, the user is considering reporting someone who didn't know their true identity. But the cashier's actions were still inappropriate and targeted the user based on a perceived identity. The user has a right to a respectful shopping environment. The key is whether the user's action of reporting is justified. Since the cashier's behavior was offensive regardless of her assumptions, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking to address it. They\u2019re not retaliating but seeking to stop harassment. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
