But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The author is Korean, bilingual, but looks Japanese and lives in a Japanese area. The cashier assumes the author is Japanese, hence speaks English. The cashier has been making derogatory comments in Korean towards customers, which the author noticed but ignored until an incident where the cashier mumbled something like telling the author to go back to Japan. Now the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier is using Korean to complain about customers, which the author can understand. The cashier's comments are not just casual stress venting but include racial slurs or negative stereotypes (like telling the author to go back to Japan). Even if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, making such comments is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author is bilingual and can understand the Korean comments, so the cashier's actions are directly targeting customers, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the cashier but not get her fired. The manager should be informed because such behavior is inappropriate and could create a hostile environment. The cashier might be violating company policies regarding harassment or discrimination. The author isn't making a false accusation; they're bringing up valid concerns. The cashier's comments are directed at customers, which is a bigger issue than just venting among employees.\n\nBut wait, the cashier might not be aware the author can understand. However, the cashier is in a customer-facing role, and the comments are made in a public space, even if in another language. The company should train employees to maintain professionalism and avoid any language that could be discriminatory. The author's decision to report is about stopping behavior that's harmful to customers, not just personal feelings. The cashier's actions could affect other customers too, not just the author.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a stand against unprofessional and potentially discriminatory behavior. The cashier's actions are the problem here, not the author for reporting. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
