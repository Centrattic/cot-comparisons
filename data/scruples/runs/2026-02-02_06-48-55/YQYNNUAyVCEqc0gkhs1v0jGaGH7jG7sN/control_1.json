But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. \n\nFirst, the cashier was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author understands. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean, so she thought the author was Japanese. The cashier said some rude things, like telling the author to go back to Japan because of a pricing error. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the key points here: The cashier was being rude in another language, assuming the customer didn't understand. The author is bilingual and overheard the comments. The cashier's remarks included a racial slur, implying the author should return to Japan. That's a problem because it's discriminatory. \n\nThe author wants to report the cashier to the manager but is concerned about the cashier's job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's wrong for the cashier to make derogatory comments, even if she didn't know the author understood. The comments included a hate speech element (\"go back to Japan\"), which is unacceptable. The author has a right to report that behavior, especially since it's discriminatory. \n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination. The manager should be informed because it's not just about one customer; it's about creating a hostile work environment or allowing discrimination. The author isn't trying to get her fired immediately but wants the behavior to stop. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up against discriminatory behavior. The cashier's actions are the issue here, not the author's intention to report. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
