But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier is talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean because they look Japanese. The author is bilingual, so they could understand the negative comments. The cashier even made a comment about the author saving 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan, which was offensive.\n\nThe author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing this. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be considered harassment or inappropriate speech. Even if the cashier didn't know the customer could understand, the customer has the right to a respectful environment. The author is in a position where they can understand the cashier's comments and are being affected by them. \n\nHowever, the author is taking advantage of their bilingualism to report someone who didn't know they were Korean. This might be seen as using a secret identity to report someone. But is that wrong? The cashier's comments were directed at customers, so the author has a right to feel targeted and seek to address it. \n\nAlso, the cashier's actions might be against company policy. Grocery stores typically have policies against harassment or inappropriate language towards customers. By reporting, the author is upholding those policies, which is a positive action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overstepping by revealing their identity, which could lead to the cashier being fired. But the author says they don't want the cashier fired, just to stop the behavior. The author's main concern is the offensive comments and wanting a respectful interaction.\n\nSo, ethically, the cashier's behavior is problematic. The author has a right to report unprofessional conduct, even if it's in another language. The fact that the cashier didn't know the author was Korean doesn't absolve them of their actions. The author is acting in their own interest and possibly for the benefit of other customers who might be targeted similarly.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to report the behavior, and their intention is to stop harassment, not to retaliate personally. The answer should be B.\n"
