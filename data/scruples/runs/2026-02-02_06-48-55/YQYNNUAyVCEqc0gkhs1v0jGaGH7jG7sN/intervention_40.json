But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is Korean but looks Japanese and lives in a Japanese area. They go to a Korean grocery store where employees assume they're Japanese and speak English. The cashier has been mumbled in Korean about customers, which the author heard because they're bilingual. The cashier even made a comment about the author after a pricing issue, saying things like \"Why not go back to Japan?\" The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nHmm. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier's comment was rude and possibly offensive, even if not in English. The author is now considering reporting it. \n\nThe key points here are: the cashier's behavior was unprofessional and harassing. The author has the right to a respectful treatment regardless of the language used. Even if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, making derogatory remarks about customers is inappropriate. The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to stop the behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this harassment. The cashier's actions were wrong, and the author is taking a responsible step to address it without overreacting. So the answer should be B.\n"
