But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier used Korean to complain about customers, which the author could understand. The cashier made a racist comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. Now the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the cashier's behavior. She was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author could understand. The cashier even made a derogatory comment when confronted. The author is bilingual and has been using that to their advantage, staying unnoticed. Now they want to report the cashier. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to consider if the cashier's actions were inappropriate. Talking negatively about customers, even in another language, is unprofessional. The cashier's comment was racially charged when she told the author to go back to Japan, which is offensive. The author has the right to report harassment or discrimination. However, the author is planning to reveal their identity as Korean, which the cashier didn't know. That might cause tension in the workplace. But is the author wrong for wanting to address the cashier's unprofessional behavior?\n\nThe author isn't looking to get the cashier fired but to stop the negative talk. The cashier's behavior is the main issue here. The author is within their rights to report it, especially since the comments were racist. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The cashier's actions are the problem, so reporting her is justified.\n"
