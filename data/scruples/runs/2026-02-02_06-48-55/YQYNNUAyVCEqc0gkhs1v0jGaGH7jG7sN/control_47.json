But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was verbally abusing customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier assumes they're Japanese, hence speaking English. The cashier has been making derogatory remarks in Korean, which the author can understand, and now the author wants to report this without getting the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and disrespectful. Even if it's in another language, the author has the right to feel disrespected. The author isn't making a false claim; they have a valid reason based on the cashier's actions. The intention to report is to address the problem without causing the cashier to lose their job, which shows the author is trying to balance things.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. Employees should maintain professionalism regardless of the language they use. The cashier's remarks could create a hostile environment, and the manager has a responsibility to address such behavior. The author isn't just being petty; they're pointing out a legitimate issue that affects customer experience.\n\nThe author's decision to report isn't malicious. They want the behavior to stop but don't want the cashier fired, indicating they understand the cashier might be under stress. The author isn't seeking revenge but a resolution. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author is overstepping by reporting someone they know is Korean and the cashier didn't know their identity. But since the cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language, the author's right to report stands. The cashier's remarks were directed at the author specifically, making it a personal issue as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing unprofessional behavior appropriately and seeking a resolution that's fair to both parties. The correct answer should be B (No).\n"
