But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and is in a Japanese-populated area. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, mumbled negative comments in Korean during checkouts. Recently, there was a price error, and the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood because they're bilingual. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was being disrespectful towards customers, which the author overheard. The cashier's comments included a racial slur (telling the customer to \"go back to Japan\") and made the customer uncomfortable. The author is considering reporting the behavior because it's unprofessional and potentially discriminatory.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the cashier was disrespectful, especially with the racial comment, which is a serious issue. The author has a right to feel targeted and wants to address it. On the other hand, the cashier might not have intended to target the author specifically since she didn't know the author was Korean. However, the author's ability to understand the comments is what made it clear.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior, not necessarily to get the cashier fired. They want the behavior to stop, which is reasonable. The cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination, especially if it's based on the customer's ethnicity. The author isn't exaggerating; they witnessed the incident and can provide specific examples.\n\nIn terms of workplace policies, many companies have guidelines against harassment and inappropriate language. Reporting the incident is within the customer's rights, especially if they feel unsafe or disrespected. The cashier's comment about sending the customer back to Japan is particularly problematic as it's a common form of racial microaggression.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up against inappropriate behavior and seeking resolution without wanting to cause harm to the cashier. The cashier's actions violate professional conduct standards, and the author has every right to report it. So the answer should be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
