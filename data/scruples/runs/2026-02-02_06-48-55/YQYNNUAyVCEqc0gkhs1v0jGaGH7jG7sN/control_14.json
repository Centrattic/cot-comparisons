But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the customer could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the customer understood Korean and made a rude comment when a pricing issue came up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was talking about customers in a derogatory way, even if she didn't know they understood. That's unprofessional and could be considered harassment or discrimination, especially if it's targeted based on nationality. The customer caught her doing this and now wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nThe customer's perspective is important. They've been frequenting the store, thinking employees assumed they were Japanese because they spoke English. Now that they've been offended by the cashier's comments, they want to address it. The author is worried about the cashier's reaction if everyone finds out they're Korean, but the main issue is the cashier's behavior.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong for reporting? Well, they have a right to a respectful environment. The cashier's comments were unprofessional and discriminatory. Reporting it to the manager is a reasonable step. However, the customer might not want the cashier to lose her job, so they're being considerate. \n\nBut the cashier's actions, regardless of intent, created a hostile environment. The customer isn't being wrong by wanting to address it. The cashier's assumption that the customer was Japanese led to her making derogatory remarks, which the customer could understand. The customer isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
