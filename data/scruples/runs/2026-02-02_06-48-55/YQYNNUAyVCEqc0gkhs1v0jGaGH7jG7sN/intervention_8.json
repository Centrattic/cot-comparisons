But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who's been making derogatory comments in Korean. The situation is that the cashier, thinking the customer is Japanese, mumbled negative things about customers in Korean. The customer, who is Korean but looks Japanese, is bilingual and heard the cashier's comments. The cashier even directly insulted the customer in a recent incident involving a pricing error.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier is using another language to make negative remarks about customers, which the customer overheard due to their bilingualism. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially since the customer is being targeted based on perceived nationality (Japanese) which they aren't. The cashier's comment about sending the customer back to Japan suggests xenophobia or racism, which is definitely inappropriate in a workplace setting.\n\nThe customer's intention is to report the behavior to the manager to stop it, not to fire the cashier. The customer is concerned about the cashier's well-being and doesn't want them to lose their job. They've tried to ignore it before, but the recent incident made them confront the issue.\n\nNow, considering if the customer is in the wrong. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be considered harassment, especially if it's directed at customers based on their perceived ethnicity. The customer has a right to a respectful service environment. By reporting the behavior, the customer is acting in their own interest and possibly protecting other customers from similar treatment. However, the customer might be overreacting if the comments weren't directed at them personally, but in this case, the cashier did direct an insult at the customer during the recent incident. \n\nThe cashier's actions cross a line when they make personal attacks, even if in another language. The customer's decision to report is justified because the behavior is harmful and unprofessional. The cashier's potential reaction (employees \"freaking out\") is a consequence of their own actions, not the customer's report. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer is not in the wrong for seeking to address the unprofessional and possibly discriminatory behavior they've experienced. They have a right to report harassment, and their intent isn't malicious but protective. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
