But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier has been making derogatory comments in Korean, which the author can understand.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so her comments were in Korean, assuming the customer wasn't Korean. The author overheard her complaining about customers in Korean, which is the cashier's native language. But when the author pointed out a pricing error, the cashier made a snide comment in Korean, which the author understood.\n\nNow, the author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job. The key points here are whether the cashier's behavior is inappropriate and if the author has a right to report it.\n\nFrom a workplace ethics perspective, employees should maintain professional behavior towards all customers, regardless of the language they use. Even if the cashier thought the customer didn't understand, making negative comments about them is unprofessional. The cashier's comment about the author going back to Japan is particularly offensive, implying that the customer doesn't belong there, which is a form of discrimination or at least disrespectful.\n\nThe author isn't looking to get the cashier fired but wants the behavior to stop. Reporting the issue to the manager is a reasonable step to address unprofessional conduct. The author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for themselves against harassment or disrespect. The cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of the language used, and the author has the right to a respectful service.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
