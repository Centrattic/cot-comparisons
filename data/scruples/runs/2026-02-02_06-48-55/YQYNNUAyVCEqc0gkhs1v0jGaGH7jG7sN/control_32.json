But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is Korean, bilingual in English and Korean, but looks Japanese and lives in an area with a Japanese population. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the employees think they're Japanese because they speak English to them. The cashier, who's Korean, often mumbles negative things in Korean during checkout, which the author overhears. The cashier even made a rude comment after a pricing error was corrected. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is important. She's talking negatively about customers in another language, which might be considered unprofessional. The author managed to understand her, which is why they're aware of the problem. The cashier's comment was offensive, even if it wasn't in English. The author wants to address the issue without causing her to lose her job. \n\nIs the author justified? The cashier was unprofessional and made a derogatory comment. The author didn't provoke her beyond correcting a price. The cashier's response was inappropriate and discriminatory. The author wants to report it, which is a reasonable step to address harassment or unprofessional behavior. \n\nBut maybe the author should have spoken up immediately? However, the cashier's comment was after the price correction, and the author might have been embarrassed or unsure. Also, the cashier didn't know the author is Korean, so she didn't realize the comment was even more offensive. \n\nIs there any fault in the author's approach? They want to report without getting her fired. That's considerate, but reporting is still necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the harassment. The cashier's actions are the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
