But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for reporting a cashier. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the customer overheard because they're bilingual. The main points are:\n\n1. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the customer understood.\n2. The cashier specifically targeted the customer by making a comment about saving 50 cents and implying they should go back to Japan.\n3. The customer is considering reporting the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. The cashier is using derogatory language towards customers, even if it's in another language. The manager would likely be concerned about such behavior regardless of the language used. The customer has a right to a respectful service environment, and the cashier's comments could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment if they're consistent.\n\nNext, the customer's intent is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier fired. The customer also has a valid reason since they were directly targeted. Since the cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, the customer's decision to report is based on their own well-being and the need for a respectful interaction.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue if the cashier is only talking in Korean, which is part of the workplace culture. But the customer is bilingual, which means the cashier's comments were directed at them and were offensive. The customer is in a position to understand and be affected by these remarks, which makes it a legitimate concern.\n\nThe manager needs to know about this behavior to address it. The customer isn't looking to cause trouble but to stop harassment. The cashier's actions might violate company policy, and the customer is within their rights to report it. The fact that the customer didn't want the cashier fired shows they're not seeking revenge, which is a positive point.\n\nIn conclusion, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate and the customer is justified in reporting it to protect themselves and others. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
