But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she mumbled in Korean, but the author overheard. The main issue is whether the author should report the cashier for her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the situation. The cashier was making negative comments about customers, even going as far as telling the author to \"go back to Japan\" after a pricing mistake. That's pretty harsh, even if it's in Korean. The author is bilingual, so they understood the comments. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she assumed the author was Japanese. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I know, it's generally acceptable to report someone if they're being rude or unprofessional, especially if it's directed at customers. The cashier's comments could be considered harassment or unprofessional behavior. Even if the cashier thought the customers were Japanese, making such comments is still inappropriate. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author is in a position where they can understand the comments because they're bilingual, which the cashier didn't know. The author is considering reporting the cashier to the manager, but wants to avoid getting her fired. The author's intention is to stop the negative talk without causing job loss. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially with the comment about going back to Japan. The author isn't making up the comments; they can prove it because they understood the Korean. Reporting this would be a responsible action to ensure a better environment for all customers. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some could argue that the author is overstepping, but given the cashier's derogatory remarks towards customers, it's a valid concern. The author is not taking revenge but addressing the inappropriate behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
