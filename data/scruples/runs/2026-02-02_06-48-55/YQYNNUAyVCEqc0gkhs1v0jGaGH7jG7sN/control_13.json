But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but is mistaken for Japanese because of their appearance. The cashier, who works at a Korean grocery store, has been muttering complaints in Korean about customers, which the author has heard but let slide until an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing error.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier assumes the author is Japanese, so she speaks English to them. The negative comments were in Korean, which the author understands. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional, especially since she's making comments about customers. The recent incident where she said something offensive, even if done in Korean, is a key point. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired, which shows they're concerned about her job. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting this? Let's break it down. The cashier's behavior includes unprofessional conduct, possibly discriminatory remarks. The author, being bilingual, is in a unique position to understand these comments. Reporting such behavior is generally acceptable, especially if it creates a hostile environment for customers. The cashier's comments about sending the customer back to Japan could be seen as xenophobic or rude, especially since the customer is actually Korean but mistaken for Japanese. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of intention. The cashier might not have known the author was Korean, so her comments might not be targeted at the author specifically. But the fact that she made a derogatory remark about going back to Japan implies a negative stereotype towards Japanese people, which is problematic regardless of the author's actual ethnic background. The author is justified in feeling uncomfortable and seeking resolution.\n\nThe author's desire to report without causing the cashier to lose her job suggests they want a fair resolution. It's possible the manager could address the behavior without termination, like a warning or training. The cashier's behavior could be against workplace policies regarding harassment or customer service standards. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the cashier's comments were in a different language and perhaps not meant to be heard by the customer. But since the author overheard them and they were directed at them (the comment about Japan), it's a valid concern. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report this. They have a right to feel safe and respected as a customer. Reporting the unprofessional behavior is reasonable, and the author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to harm the cashier. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
