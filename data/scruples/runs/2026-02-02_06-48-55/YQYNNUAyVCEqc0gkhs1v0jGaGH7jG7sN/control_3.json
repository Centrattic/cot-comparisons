But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. Let's start by reading their situation carefully.\n\nThe user is Korean but bilingual, looks Japanese, and lives in an area with a Japanese population. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly. The cashier assumes they're Japanese since they speak English. The cashier mumbles negative things in Korean about customers, which the user can understand. The user usually ignores it, thinking the job is stressful. Recently, the cashier made a sarcastic comment in Korean when the user pointed out a price error. The user wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired because they think the employees don't know the user is Korean. The question is whether the user is at fault (AITA) for reporting this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cashier's actions. She's making derogatory comments in another language about customers. Even if it's not in English, it's still unprofessional and could be discriminatory. The user has a right to a professional environment and can report harassment or unprofessional behavior. The cashier's comments were directed at the user, implying they should go back to Japan and suggesting they're cheap. That's offensive regardless of the language used.\n\nThe user is bilingual, so they can understand the comments. The cashier's behavior is targeted, which is a problem. The user isn't just imagining things; they have evidence of the cashier's remarks. The user wants to address the issue without getting the cashier fired, which shows they're being considerate. The store manager has a responsibility to ensure a respectful workplace and customer environment. Reporting the issue is the right step to take. The cashier's behavior could be a form of harassment or discrimination, especially since the comment included a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\"), which is a form of racial profiling or xenophobia.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the cashier's comments are just venting stress and not intended to harm anyone. However, the fact that the cashier used a racial slur and targeted a specific customer makes it more than just venting. The user has a right to not be subjected to such treatment. Also, the cashier's comments could be seen as discriminatory based on the user's perceived nationality, which is a protected class in many places. The user isn't breaking any rules by reporting; they're standing up against harassment. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially illegal, so the user is justified in seeking intervention from the manager.\n"
