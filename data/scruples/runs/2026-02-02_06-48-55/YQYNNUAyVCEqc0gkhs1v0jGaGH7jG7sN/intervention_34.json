But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to report the grocery cashier. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, assuming they were Japanese. The cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing issue, and the author is considering reporting it but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The cashier was speaking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand. The cashier's comment was rude and offensive, even if not overtly hostile. The author, being Korean, found out that the cashier was making these remarks, possibly out of stress or frustration. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior but doesn't want her to lose her job.\n\nThe key points here are the cashier's actions and the author's response. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and unacceptable, regardless of the language used. Even if the cashier thought she was speaking in her native tongue and that customers couldn't understand, that doesn't excuse the remarks. The author, being able to understand, has a right to be offended and to report it. However, the author is also considering the cashier's well-being and the potential consequences for her job, which shows some level of empathy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to report the cashier. If the cashier was indeed speaking negatively about customers, then it's a valid reason to report. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants the behavior to stop. The cashier's comment directed at the author was particularly harsh, implying the author should return to Japan and suggesting they're poor. That's a clear case of unprofessional conduct and possibly discriminatory remarks.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping if the cashier's comments weren't intended for her. But since the cashier made a direct comment to the author, it's a personal slight. The author's intention is to address the behavior without causing harm, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author has a right to seek resolution. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
