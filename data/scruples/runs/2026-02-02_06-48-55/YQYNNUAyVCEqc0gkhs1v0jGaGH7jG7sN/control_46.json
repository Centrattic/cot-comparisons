But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is Korean but appears Japanese, and they go to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, has been making negative comments in Korean towards customers. The author heard her say some rude things, like questioning why they're saving 50 cents and telling them to go back to Japan. The author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, the cashier's actions: she's making derogatory remarks about customers in another language, which the author can understand. Even if the cashier doesn't realize the author is Korean, it's still unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The comments about returning to Japan are clearly racist. The cashier shouldn't be making such remarks regardless of who overhears.\n\nThe author's response: they want to report the behavior to the manager. Since the cashier's comments are offensive and unprofessional, it's reasonable for the author to take action. The author isn't trying to get her fired immediately but wants to address the issue. The manager should be informed to handle it appropriately, which might involve training or disciplinary action. \n\nThe author isn't the one at fault here. They're standing up against discrimination and harassment. The cashier is the one acting inappropriately. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to retaliate. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
