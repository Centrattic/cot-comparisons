But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier is talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because he's bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so he's in a unique position to hear what's being said. \n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior: she's mumbled complaints in Korean about customers, which the author can understand. She made a derogatory comment to the author after a pricing issue. The author wants to report her but is concerned about her getting fired.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for reporting. On one hand, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author has the right to report harassment or discrimination, especially if it's affecting their experience. On the other hand, the author is using their knowledge of the cashier's language against her, which could be seen as a trap. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so maybe she wouldn't have said that if she had. \n\nBut the author isn't necessarily trying to trap her. They might just want to address the behavior without causing harm. The cashier's comments were offensive and targeted the author, especially the part about going back to Japan. That's a personal attack based on the author's perceived ethnicity. Reporting that could be justified, even if the author's identity was a factor. \n\nAlso, the author wants to report the manager without wanting the cashier to lose her job. That shows some consideration. The key issue is whether the cashier's behavior crosses into harassment. If the comments are offensive and directed at customers, the store should be aware. The author isn't making up the issue just to get someone fired; they have a legitimate complaint. \n\nIn the end, the author might have a valid reason to report, especially since the cashier's actions were hurtful and targeted, even if the author's Korean identity played a role in how it unfolded. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
