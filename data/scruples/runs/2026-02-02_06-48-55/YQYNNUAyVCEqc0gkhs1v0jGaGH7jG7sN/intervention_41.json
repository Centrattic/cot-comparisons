But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier.\n\nFirst, the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier's comments weren't overtly offensive but were still disrespectful, like complaining customers are demanding. The author tried to ignore it before because they assumed the job was stressful. But then the cashier directly insulted the author in Korean, making them feel targeted. The author wants to report this behavior but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The cashier's actions involve harassment or disrespectful behavior towards customers, which is unprofessional. The author has a right to feel targeted and wants to address it. However, the cashier might not have known the author understood Korean, which complicates things. But the cashier shouldn't be using her job to vent or insult customers, regardless of the language she uses. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not get the cashier fired, which is reasonable. Reporting it to the manager is a legitimate way to address workplace misconduct. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. The cashier is the one who engaged in inappropriate behavior, so the answer is B.\n"
