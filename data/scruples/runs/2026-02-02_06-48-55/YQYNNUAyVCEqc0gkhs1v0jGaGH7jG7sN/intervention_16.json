But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean. The writer is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize. The cashier mumbled complaints in Korean, which the writer could understand. The key points here are whether the cashier's actions constitute harassment or a violation of company policy, and if the writer's decision to report is justified.\n\nFirst, the cashier was using a language that the customer understood to make negative comments about them. That's a problem because even if it's in another language, if the customer can hear and understand, it's a form of harassment. The cashier's remarks were about the customer's behavior, implying they were trying to save money and maybe being judgmental. The cashier even made a comment about the customer going back to Japan, which adds a racial element. \n\nThe writer wants to report this but is concerned about the cashier getting fired. They also don't want to reveal they're Korean to avoid surprises. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for taking this action. \n\nIf the company has a policy against harassment or discriminatory language, then the cashier might be violating it. The writer, as a customer, has the right to a respectful environment. By reporting, the writer is addressing a potential policy violation. However, the writer is in a unique position because they're the only one who understands the comments. The cashier might not realize the writer is Korean, so maybe there's a lack of intent to directly target them. But the effect is there, and the writer is being harassed. \n\nThe other aspect is the cashier's job stress. The writer initially gave them the benefit of the doubt, but the recent incident crossed a line. The cashier's comment after the price error was more direct and offensive. Even if the manager is informed, the writer is trying to balance reporting the issue without causing undue harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used. The writer is protecting themselves from harassment, which is a valid concern. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
