But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier talks negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean until maybe now, since the author looks Japanese and the store assumes that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's mumbled negative comments in Korean about customers, including the author. Even if it's not highly offensive, it's still unprofessional. The cashier is being rude and disrespectful to customers, even if she thinks they can't understand. The author is justified in feeling bothered because they heard the negative remarks directed at them.\n\nNow, the author wants to report this to the manager. The key points here are: the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially violates workplace conduct policies. The author wants to address this without getting her fired, which shows they have a sense of fairness. The cashier might not be aware that the author understands Korean, but that doesn't excuse her behavior if the store has policies against such conduct.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was being unprofessional. The author has a right to a respectful service. By reporting, the author is holding the employee accountable, which is reasonable. The cashier's actions could lead to complaints from other customers too. The author isn't trying to get her fired but to make her stop, which is appropriate.\n\nThe cashier's comment about the author going back to Japan is also a problem. That's a racial slur and could be considered discriminatory. Even if the cashier didn't know the author is Korean, making a comment about going back to where they came from is inappropriate and could be grounds for disciplinary action. The author's intention is to address the issue, not to cause harm, so they're not in the wrong here.\n\nI think the author is right to report the cashier's behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it.\n"
