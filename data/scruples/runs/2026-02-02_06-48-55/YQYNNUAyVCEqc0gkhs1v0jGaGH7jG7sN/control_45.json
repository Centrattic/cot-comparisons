But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The cashier has been muttering negative comments in Korean, which the author can understand. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean, thinking they're Japanese. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior. She's been making negative remarks about customers in another language, which is unprofessional. Even if she thought the customer was Japanese, she still shouldn't be making comments about customers behind their backs. The author caught her doing exactly that in English, but the cashier avoided eye contact. That's a problem because it's disrespectful and creates a hostile environment. \n\nThe author is bilingual, so they can understand the Korean comments. The cashier's remarks here are not just about the author but about all customers. If the cashier is making negative comments about customers in general, that could affect the store's reputation and employee conduct. The store has a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment for all customers, regardless of language barriers.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job. They want the manager to address the issue. Since the cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially harmful to the work environment, it's reasonable for the author to bring it up. The author isn't trying to get her fired but to make her stop the inappropriate behavior. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author is overreacting because the cashier didn't realize they were Korean. But the author's presence as a Korean person who can hear the comments adds a layer where the cashier's behavior is being directly witnessed. Also, the cashier's comment about the author's Japanese identity could be seen as discriminatory, which is a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of company policy, most places have guidelines against harassment and unprofessional conduct. The author is acting within their rights to report something that affects their shopping experience and the store's environment. The author's desire to avoid getting the cashier fired shows consideration, but the manager should handle the situation appropriately based on the policy. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the cashier's behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional, and the author has a right to expect respectful treatment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
