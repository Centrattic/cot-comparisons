But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese and spoke English. The cashier used Korean to complain about customers, and when the author corrected a pricing error, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean. The author now wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier was making negative remarks about customers in another language, which is unprofessional. Even if the cashier didn't realize the author is Korean, there's still an issue with her behavior. The author is bilingual and overheard the comments, which they found offensive. The cashier's comment was rude and potentially discriminatory, regardless of the language used.\n\nHowever, the author is in a unique position because they are Korean but were mistaken as Japanese. This might mean the cashier wasn't intentionally targeting the author but just happened to talk badly about customers in general. The author's decision to report the cashier could be seen as justified because the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and possibly creates a hostile work environment for the author. Yet, the author is also taking advantage of their hidden identity to confront the cashier, which could be seen as a bit of a trick. \n\nThe cashier's comment was not only about the price discrepancy but also included a personal attack. That's a serious issue regardless of the language. The author's main concern is the unprofessional conduct and the personal remark. Reporting it to the manager is about addressing that behavior, not necessarily exposing the cashier's mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean. But since the author is bilingual and was directly targeted with a personal comment, it's reasonable to want to address the issue. The intent here is to stop the negative talk, not to get the cashier fired. The manager should be informed so they can handle the situation professionally. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's unprofessional behavior, especially after experiencing a direct personal attack. The key is that the cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is seeking a resolution without causing harm to the cashier's job. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
