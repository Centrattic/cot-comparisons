He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that the guy, David, littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the car window. The author found this unattractive and decided to end the relationship, even though their friend Sarah thinks it's petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal values. Littering is a choice that affects the environment. The author mentions they care about recycling and not trashing the planet. For someone who values environmental responsibility, this behavior might be a red flag. Even if it's not a huge issue for others, personal compatibility in values is important in relationships.\n\nThen there's the reaction. The author didn't make a big deal out of it at the moment but later ended things. They didn't mention the littering when declining the third date. The friend thinks it's too small a reason, but the author felt it was about character. It's about how significant the action is to the individual. If this behavior reflects a lack of consideration or respect for the environment, it's a valid concern for the author.\n\nAlso, the author isn't an eco-activist, just someone who cares. So it's reasonable for them to have this as a deal-breaker. People have different deal-breakers, and it's their right to make choices based on their own values. The friend's judgment about being \"bitchy\" is subjective. The key here is whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. Since they found it unattractive and it made them lose interest, it's their personal preference. No one is in the wrong for their own standards in a relationship unless it's a matter of right or wrong. Littering is against the law in many places, so it's not just a moral issue but also a legal one. The author isn't being in the wrong for valuing someone who respects laws and the environment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their values. The friend's opinion doesn't negate the author's feelings. It's their decision to prioritize environmental responsibility in a partner.\n"
