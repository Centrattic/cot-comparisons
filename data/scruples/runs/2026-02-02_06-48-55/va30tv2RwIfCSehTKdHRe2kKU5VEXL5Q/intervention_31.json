He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author met David, they had a good time on two dates. But during the dinner date, David threw out a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior off-putting and decided not to pursue a third date. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty over a small issue.\n\nSo, the key points here are the littering incident and the author's reaction to it. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. David's action was casual and dismissive, which made the author lose interest. The friend argues it's a minor reason to end things.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Values are subjective, so what one person finds a deal-breaker, another might not. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally considered disrespectful to the environment. The author's reason for not continuing the relationship is based on David's behavior reflecting his character, which the author found unattractive. \n\nSarah's perspective is that it's petty, but the author's reaction is based on their personal values. They didn't bring up the littering directly but made a decision based on it. The author isn't wrong for valuing environmental responsibility. People have different standards, and relationships often depend on shared values. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their decision is based on personal values and David's behavior that they found unacceptable. It's their right to choose partners who align with their principles, even if others see it as trivial.\n"
