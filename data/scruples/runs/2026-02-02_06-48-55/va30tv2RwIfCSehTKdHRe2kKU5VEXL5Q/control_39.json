He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that the guy they were dating littered during a drive-thru coffee stop. The author didn't like that and ended the relationship, but their friend thinks it's a petty reason.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the scenario. Littering is an environmental issue, but is it a valid reason to end a relationship? The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic but care about recycling. The guy's action was throwing a McDonald's cup out the window, which is clearly littering. The author was put off by his casual attitude towards it.\n\nNow, considering personal values and red flags in relationships. People have different priorities. For some, respect for the environment is important. The author might be prioritizing that, while their friend thinks it's trivial. But it's their choice who they date, right? If the author finds that behavior unattractive, it's a valid reason to end things.\n\nAlso, the guy was nonchalant about his actions, which might indicate a lack of consideration or responsibility. The author might see that as a character flaw. Even if others think it's minor, personal boundaries matter. The friend's opinion is subjective, but the author's comfort and values are their own.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their values over the relationship. I don't think so. People have different deal-breakers. Littering is a public issue and shows disregard for others' environment. It's reasonable for the author to decide that's incompatible with their values.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). They're justified in their decision based on their personal standards and the guy's attitude towards his actions.\n"
