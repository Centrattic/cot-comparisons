He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author met David through a friend, Sarah. They went on a couple of dates, which went well. The problem arose when David threw a McDonald's cup out of the car window after getting coffee. The author found this really off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. Sarah, the mutual friend, thinks the author is being too picky about something small. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending things over this.\n\nFirst, I should consider what littering represents. Littering is an environmental issue, but it's also about personal responsibility and respect for public spaces. The author mentions they're not an \"eco fanatic,\" but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So for them, littering is a deal-breaker because it shows a lack of consideration. \n\nNow, David's action was a single instance, but the author notes that he did it casually, which implies it might be a regular habit. The way he shrugged it off when confronted could indicate a lack of awareness or respect for others' values. The author's reaction is based on personal values, which are valid. People often break up over differences in core values, so this isn't trivial.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah thinks it's a small thing compared to other potential issues. But the key here is that it's about the author's personal boundaries. If someone's values clash with yours in a significant way, it's reasonable to end the relationship. The author isn't making a moral judgment but stating that this behavior made them feel negatively about David's character, which is their prerogative.\n\nI should also think about whether there's a cultural or situational context. Some people might litter without thinking, but others see it as a serious issue. The author isn't overreacting if this behavior conflicts with their beliefs. It's a matter of personal choice in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their own values and boundaries. It's their right to decide who they want to be in a relationship with based on such actions.\n"
