He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author met David, had a good time on the first two dates. Then, on the dinner date, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the car window while they were at Starbucks drive-thru. The author found that really off-putting and decided not to continue dating him. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty over a small issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over David's littering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the values and norms around littering. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally frowned upon. It's considered a sign of disrespect towards the environment and public spaces. The author mentions they aren't an eco-activist but still care about not trashing the planet. So, the issue here is about personal values clashing with someone else's behavior.\n\nDavid's action was casual and nonchalant, which makes it seem like a regular habit. The author's reaction is based on this behavior affecting their perception of David's character. Even though the friend thinks it's petty, the author's decision is based on their own standards. \n\nIn relationships, people often have deal-breakers based on their personal values. Littering could be seen as a lack of consideration for others and the environment. The author isn't condemning David for a major ethical issue but rather a behavior that indicates poor habits or disregard for societal norms. \n\nHowever, some might argue that littering is a minor issue compared to other potential red flags. The friend's perspective is that the author is overreacting. But the author's feelings are valid because they felt the action reflected on David's character. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action taken by the person is unreasonable. The author chose not to continue the relationship based on observed behavior that conflicted with their values. Since personal preferences and values are subjective, it's hard to say the author is wrong unless there's a clear indication that littering isn't a significant issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author has the right to prioritize their values regarding environmental care and personal habits in a partner. The decision to end the relationship is based on their own standards, and unless there's a clear harm beyond the littering incident, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
