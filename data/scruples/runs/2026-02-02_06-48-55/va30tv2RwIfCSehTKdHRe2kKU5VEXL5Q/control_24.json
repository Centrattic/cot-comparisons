He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending the relationship over someone littering. So the situation is that the author went on two dates with David, liked him, but when he threw out a McDonald's cup while driving, they lost interest. Now their friend Sarah thinks they're being petty and not giving David another chance just because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, littering is a negative behavior. It shows a lack of consideration for the environment and public spaces. The author mentions they\u2019re not an eco-fanatic, but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So for them, seeing David litter so casually might be a deal-breaker. It's possible that this action revealed something about David's character that the author found unappealing, like a disregard for social norms or responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues that it's a petty reason to end a potential relationship, especially since the first two dates went well. Littering might not be as significant as other issues, like dishonesty or abuse. The author didn't mention other red flags, so Sarah might think the littering is an overreaction. However, personal values and deal-breakers vary between individuals. What one person sees as trivial, another might find important.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Since littering is illegal in many places and reflects poorly on someone's habits and respect for the environment, it's a valid concern. The author might be prioritizing environmental responsibility and cleanliness, which are legitimate values. David's nonchalant attitude could indicate that he's not bothered by his actions, which the author might find incompatible with their own standards.\n\nMoreover, the author didn't confront David about it during the third date, which might make it seem like they're holding onto that one issue. But if the littering was a clear display of David's behavior, the author has the right to decide it's not acceptable for a relationship. The friend Sarah's perspective is that it's too small a reason, but relationships are built on mutual compatibility in values and habits. If the author values environmental responsibility and respect for public spaces, then David's littering is a significant issue for them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries based on their personal values. Even if others see it as petty, the decision is about their comfort and what they consider important in a partner. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
