He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy named David littering, which made the author lose interest in pursuing a relationship. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty over a small thing, but the author feels that David's casual attitude about littering was a red flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that littering is a character issue. Even if they aren't an eco-activist, they care about not trashing the planet. The act of throwing a McDonald's cup out the window was unacceptable, especially since David was nonchalant about it. That behavior might indicate a lack of consideration for others and the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues that this is a minor issue compared to other potential problems in a relationship. Maybe she thinks it's too petty to end things over one instance of littering. But then again, if David regularly litters, it shows a pattern of disrespect. The author might be justified in feeling that this reflects on David's character and how he treats the world around him, which could impact their relationship.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Littering is generally frowned upon. It's illegal in many places and considered inconsiderate. If David is caught doing it casually, it might be a sign of poor judgment or a lack of responsibility. The author might be right to see this as a deal-breaker because it shows how he might treat other aspects of a relationship\u2014disregarding the environment could translate to other inconsiderate behaviors.\n\nBut is it the author's fault for ending the relationship over this? If they communicated their values and found that David's actions clashed with their own, it's reasonable to step back. People have different deal-breakers. The author isn't being mean for not wanting to date someone who litters, especially since they found common ground otherwise but this act made them lose interest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason to prioritize their values. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
