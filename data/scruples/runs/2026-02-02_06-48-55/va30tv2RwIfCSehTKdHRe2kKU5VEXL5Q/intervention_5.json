He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on two dates with David. They liked him but during the second date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author was turned off by this and ended the relationship, with a friend criticizing them as being petty. The author wonders if they're in the wrong.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, littering is a common issue, and some might say the author is overreacting over a single incident. The friend Sarah argues it's a small thing compared to other potential problems in a relationship. The question is whether this is a valid reason to end things.\n\nOn the other hand, the author values environmental responsibility. They mention they recycle and care about not trashing the planet. Littering, especially in a casual and nonchalant manner, might reflect poorly on David's character traits like respect for others' environment and consideration. For the author, it's a deal-breaker because it shows a lack of care, which could indicate other negative traits. \n\nI need to weigh personal values against social norms. While littering is illegal and generally frowned upon, some people might not see it as a red flag for a relationship. However, if someone's values align with environmental concerns, this could be a significant issue for them. The author's reaction is personal and based on their own principles, which is valid even if others disagree.\n\nAlso, the friend's perspective is that the author is being \"bitchy,\" but that's a judgment of the author's feelings. The author's decision is based on their own standards, which they have the right to set. It's important to note that relationships are about mutual compatibility, and differing values can lead to incompatibility even if one issue seems minor to others.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their values and how much weight they assign to this action. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't violating any laws or ethics, their decision is a personal choice. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because personal values are subjective, and it's reasonable for someone to end a relationship over a deal-breaker like littering, especially if it conflicts with their principles.\n"
