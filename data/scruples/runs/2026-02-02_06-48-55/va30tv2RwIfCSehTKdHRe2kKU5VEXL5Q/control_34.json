He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy named David who littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue dating him because of that. The friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it's about the person's character.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The littering incident happened when David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The littering was done casually, which made the author lose interest. The author ended things on the third date, and the friend thinks it's a stupid reason. \n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. To decide between A and B, I need to think about whether the author's reaction is justified. Littering is an environmental issue, and character judgments can be made based on small actions. Some might see it as a minor thing, while others see it as a reflection of someone's values. \n\nThe author's friend argues it's petty, but the author's reasoning is about character. If someone's actions show a disregard for the environment, that could be a deal-breaker for some. It's about personal values. The author didn't make a big deal out of it but felt it was a sign of David's character. \n\nIn relationships, people often have deal-breakers based on their values. Littering might not be a major crime, but it's a habit that can indicate a person's responsibility and respect for the environment. The author is within their right to choose not to continue a relationship if this behavior conflicts with their values. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one instance isn't enough to judge someone, but the author saw it as a regular habit given David's casual attitude. The friend's perspective is that it's too minor, but that's a subjective opinion. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because personal values and deal-breakers are valid in relationships. The author isn't obligated to overlook values they hold dear. The friend's judgment doesn't negate the author's right to make that choice.\n"
