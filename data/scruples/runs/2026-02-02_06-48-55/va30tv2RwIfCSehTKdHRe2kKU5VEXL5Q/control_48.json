He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking things off with David because he littered. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a couple of dates with David. They liked each other, but during the drive home after coffee, David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found that really off-putting and decided not to pursue the relationship further. Their friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to end the relationship over this. Let me break it down. \n\nLittering is illegal in many places and is generally frowned upon. It's considered disrespectful towards the environment and shows a lack of consideration for others and the community. The key points here are the author's reaction and the nature of the incident. \n\nThe author isn't an environmental extremist, just someone who cares about not trashing the planet. The action of littering, especially in a casual, nonchalant way, made them lose interest. The friend argues it's a small thing, but the author sees it as indicative of David's character. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, values and deal-breakers are important. If someone does something that shows they don't respect certain values (like environmental responsibility), it's reasonable for the author to feel it's a deal-breaker. The fact that David was so dismissive and shrugged it off might indicate he's not someone who values responsibility or consideration, which are important traits in a partner. \n\nThe friend's criticism that it's petty might be a matter of differing opinions. What one person sees as a minor issue, another might see as a reflection of deeper character traits. The author isn't making a moral crusade but is acting on a personal value. \n\nSo, in the context of relationships, it's common for people to have different thresholds for what they can accept. If littering is a deal-breaker for the author, they aren't wrong for following their instincts. The fact that David was so casual about it suggests it's a habit, which the author might not want to be part of. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
