He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that David littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Littering is an action that reflects someone's character and habits. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The action of littering, even if it's a small incident, might indicate a lack of consideration or respect for the environment. The author found it unattractive and lost interest, which seems personal but valid.\n\nThe friend Sarah thinks it's petty because it's just one thing after a good start. But the author feels it's about character. So the question is whether the author's reason is valid. \n\nLittering is illegal in many places and can have environmental impacts. It's also a sign of someone's attitude towards public spaces and responsibility. If someone is okay with littering, maybe they're not conscientious in other areas too. The author might be making a judgment based on values alignment, which is a common reason in relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted because it was a single incident. But if it's a consistent habit (as the author implies David does it regularly), then it's a pattern. The author isn't saying David is a bad person, but the behavior clashed with their values. \n\nIn relationships, people often prioritize values like respect, responsibility, and care. Littering might be seen as a sign of disrespect. The author isn't making a huge deal out of a minor inconvenience but a principle. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for valuing someone's habits that align with their own. \n\nSarah's perspective is that it's a small thing, but the author's reaction is about personal values. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because it's a valid personal choice regarding values and habits.\n"
