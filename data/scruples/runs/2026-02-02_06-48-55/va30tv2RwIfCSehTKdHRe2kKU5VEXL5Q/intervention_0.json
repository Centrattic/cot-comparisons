He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for ending the relationship because the guy littered.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author met David, they had a good time, but during a drive, David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found that unattractive and decided not to continue dating him. The friend, Sarah, thinks it's a petty reason.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified.\n\nLittering is illegal in many places and it's considered bad behavior. The fact that David did it casually suggests he's not concerned about it, which the author found off-putting. The author isn't an eco-activist but still cares about not trashing the planet. Personal values about respecting the environment might be a deal-breaker for some people. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues it's a small issue compared to other potential problems. Maybe she thinks one incident isn't enough to end a relationship. But the author felt it revealed something about David's character that made them incompatible.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's about whether the person's actions were objectively wrong. The author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing not to date someone they find incompatible. Their reasoning might be a personal preference, but it's their right to decide what's acceptable in a partner. The real question is if the author is being too nitpicky. However, values like environmental responsibility can be significant in relationships. If someone values that, it's reasonable to consider littering a red flag.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on their personal values and how the action reflects on David's character. The friend's opinion doesn't make the author wrong; it's about personal judgment. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
