He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The scenario is that David littered during their date, which made the author lose interest, even though they were getting along well otherwise. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal values and boundaries in relationships. Littering is an environmental issue, but it's not a criminal offense. The author isn't an eco-activist but still finds it unattractive. The key points are whether the littering is a valid reason to end things and if the author overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, littering shows a disregard for public spaces and the environment. If the author values responsibility and respect for the environment, this could be a deal-breaker. The fact that David was nonchalant about it might indicate a larger issue with his attitude towards such behaviors.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues it's a petty reason. Maybe she thinks one incident isn't enough to judge someone's character. But the author might see it as a reflection of David's character, like being irresponsible or inconsiderate. It's possible that the author's reaction is based on personal principles, which are valid even if others don't share them.\n\nIn relationships, people often have different deal-breakers. What matters is whether the author's decision is based on their own values. Since the author felt it was significant enough to lose interest, it's their right to make that choice. The friend's opinion doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; it's about personal judgment.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's action is unjustified. Since the author is acting on their own values and the decision is a personal one, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
