He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because David littered. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nThe author met David, they had a good time on a few dates. Then David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found that really off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. David's friend Sarah thinks the author is being too petty about it. The author isn't an eco-warrior, but they care about recycling and not trashing the planet.\n\nFirst, is littering a big deal? Well, littering is illegal in many places and it's harmful to the environment. It shows a lack of consideration for public spaces and others. The author didn't find David's casual attitude towards littering attractive. That makes sense because values and habits can be important in a relationship. Disrespecting the environment might indicate a broader disregard for rules or others' well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah says it's a small thing compared to other issues. But is it really that small? If someone is okay with littering, maybe they have other habits or attitudes that could be problematic. The author felt it was a deal-breaker, which is their right. People have different deal-breakers, and personal values play a big role in relationships.\n\nThe author didn't confront David about it during the date but ended the relationship after the third date. They might have thought it was important enough to not continue. It's their choice to prioritize environmental responsibility in a partner. Just because someone else thinks it's petty doesn't make the author wrong. People have different standards, and it's okay to end a relationship over something that matters to you, even if others don't see it that way.\n\nSo, considering that the author had a valid reason based on their values, even if others don't agree, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
