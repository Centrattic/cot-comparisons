He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because the guy littered. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on two dates with David. During the second date, after getting coffee, David threw an old McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this really off-putting and decided not to continue dating him. The friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal values and what's considered a deal-breaker. Littering is an environmental issue, but the author isn't an eco-activist. They mention caring about not trashing the planet, so it's a personal value. David's casual attitude towards it might indicate a lack of consideration or responsibility, which the author found unattractive.\n\nThe friend Sarah argues it's a small thing, but the author felt it affected their perception of David's character. Is it fair to end a relationship over one action? Well, in relationships, people have different deal-breakers. If someone's actions conflict with your values, it's reasonable to reassess compatibility. Littering isn't illegal in every place, but it's a matter of respect for the environment and public spaces.\n\nThe author didn't confront David immediately but ended things after the second date when they noticed the littering. David's nonchalant response might have confirmed the author's negative reaction. The author isn't making a big environmental statement, just finding the act inconsiderate. \n\nIn such cases, it's about personal judgment. The author isn't wrong for valuing environmental responsibility. If someone's behavior doesn't align with your values, it's valid to distance yourself. The friend's opinion that it's petty might not consider the author's perspective. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because personal values and red flags vary, and it's reasonable for the author to act on their own boundaries.\n"
