He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that the author met David, had a good time on a couple of dates, but during the drive home after the second date, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the car window. The author found this unacceptable and decided not to continue the relationship. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty, but the author feels that David's casual attitude towards littering was a character flaw that made them lose interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. Littering is generally considered rude and irresponsible. It's a matter of personal values and how one views such behavior. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. David's action was a one-time instance, but the author saw it as a reflection of his character. \n\nThe friend Sarah argues that the author is overreacting over a small issue, especially since the previous dates went well. However, the key here is that the author felt the littering was a deal-breaker. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nIn terms of values, people have different deal-breakers. Some might think littering is a minor issue, while others see it as indicative of disrespect for the environment and community. The author's decision is based on their own values and how it made them feel about David's character. \n\nThe author didn't confront David about it during the third date but ended things. That could be seen as avoiding a confrontation, but it's their choice to end the relationship if they feel incompatible. The friend's judgment that it's petty doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nLegally, littering is against the law in many places, but the ethical question here is personal. The author's reaction is about personal values and how they align with their potential partner. Since the author lost interest and felt it was a character flaw, it's a matter of personal preference. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the action in question is objectively wrong or a personal preference. Littering is objectively wrong, but whether it's a deal-breaker is subjective. The author isn't wrong for having that value. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue the relationship based on this action. The answer should be B.\n"
