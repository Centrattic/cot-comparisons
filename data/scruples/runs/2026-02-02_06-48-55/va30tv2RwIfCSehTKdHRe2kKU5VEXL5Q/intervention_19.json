He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy named David who littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of his car window during a date. The author of the post is the woman who was on the date, and she decided not to continue the relationship because of this incident. Her friend Sarah thinks she's being petty and overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the woman is in the wrong. The key points here are the act of littering and the woman's reaction. Littering is generally considered a negative behavior, and different people might have varying levels of tolerance for it. The woman mentions she isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The fact that David did this casually, without remorse, and shrugged it off might have contributed to her decision.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, littering is illegal in many places and is frowned upon by many. The woman's values about environmental care and respect for public spaces could be valid reasons for her to not want to continue the relationship. People often have red lines in relationships, and values alignment is important. If littering reflects a disregard for the environment or carelessness, that could be a significant deal-breaker for her.\n\nHer friend Sarah argues that it's a petty reason, especially since the rest of the dates went well. However, the woman's experience during the littering incident might have revealed aspects of David's character that she found incompatible. Even if the act itself seems minor to some, the way David handled it (nonchalant, no apology) could indicate a lack of consideration or respect, which are important traits in a partner.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a single instance of littering shouldn't end a potential relationship, especially if the rest of the dates were positive. There's a question of whether the woman gave David an opportunity to correct his behavior or explain himself. However, she did mention that after the incident, she lost interest and didn't pursue further dates. It's possible that the act was a deal-breaker for her, and she's within her rights to prioritize her personal values in choosing a partner.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the woman is in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the community's opinion leans towards valuing personal boundaries and environmental ethics, then she's not in the wrong. If others prioritize not overreacting to minor issues, then she might be seen as petty. However, since the act was intentional and showed a lack of care, and she made her decision based on her values, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
