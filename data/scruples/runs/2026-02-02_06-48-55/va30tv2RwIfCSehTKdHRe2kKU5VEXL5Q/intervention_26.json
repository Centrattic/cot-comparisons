He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking off the relationship because David littered.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author liked David initially, but when David threw a McDonald's cup out the window, they lost interest. They didn't mention it again and ended the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nLittering is a common issue. Some people might see it as a minor thing, while others might see it as indicative of someone's values. The key points here are the author's perspective on the littering being a deal-breaker and their friend's view that it's too small a reason.\n\nI should consider if the author overreacted. Littering is illegal in many places and can harm the environment. However, maybe the author is using this as an excuse because they lost interest for other reasons. But in the story, the author says they were enthusiastic before that incident, so the littering seems to be the main trigger. \n\nPersonal values matter in relationships. If someone's actions go against your core values, it's reasonable to step back. The author isn't an eco-fanatic but still cares about not trashing the planet. The casual attitude of David might have shown disrespect for the environment and others' feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the behavior first. Like, maybe talking to David about it instead of immediately ending the relationship. But the author might feel that the action was so off-putting that they couldn't continue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because personal values and deal-breakers are valid in relationships. It's their choice to prioritize someone's respect for the environment. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue it's too minor. However, given the context, the author's reasoning is valid.\n"
