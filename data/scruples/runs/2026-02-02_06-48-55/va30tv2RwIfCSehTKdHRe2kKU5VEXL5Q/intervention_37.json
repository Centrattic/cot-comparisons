He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with David over littering. The person's friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels that David's casual littering was a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Littering is illegal in many places and is harmful to the environment. While it's true that it's not the worst possible offense, it does reflect on someone's character. The author mentions that David wasn't an eco-activist but still cares about not trashing the planet. The act of littering, especially in a casual, nonchalant manner, could indicate a lack of respect for the environment and possibly for others' property or cleanliness standards.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal values and deal-breakers in relationships. What one person finds unacceptable, another might not. The author isn't saying they won't date anyone who ever littered once, but David's behavior was a red flag for them. It's important in relationships to align on core values, and if littering is a significant issue for the author, then it's reasonable for them to act on that.\n\nSarah's perspective is that the author is being petty. However, Sarah might not share the same environmental concerns. The author's friend's judgment isn't necessarily right or wrong; it's just a difference in priorities. The key here is whether the author overreacted. Since the author felt it was a character flaw and lost interest, it's their right to make that decision. \n\nAlso, the situation is about personal choice. The author isn't harming anyone by ending the relationship. They have the right to set boundaries based on their values. The littering incident was a clear action that made the author uncomfortable, and they made their decision based on that. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values in a relationship.\n"
