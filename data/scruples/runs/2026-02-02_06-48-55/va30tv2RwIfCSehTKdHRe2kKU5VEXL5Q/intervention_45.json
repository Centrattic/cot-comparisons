He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The author is the one who ended things with David because he threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty, but the author feels differently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author liked David and they had a good time on two dates. The breaking point was when David littered. The author isn't an eco-fanatic but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The problem is the casual attitude David had about littering, which made the author lose interest. The friend Sarah thinks it's a stupid reason because it's just one small thing, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The question hinges on whether ending things over this is justified. Littering is a personal issue for the author. It's a matter of values and personal preferences. The author has the right to make decisions based on their own standards. If David's behavior conflicted with the author's values enough to end a budding relationship, that's their choice. However, some might argue that it's a small issue and not worth ending a relationship over, but others might see it as a deal-breaker.\n\nThe key here is that the author is not being unreasonable in their stance. They have a valid reason based on their own principles. The friend's judgment is subjective. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values in a relationship.\n"
