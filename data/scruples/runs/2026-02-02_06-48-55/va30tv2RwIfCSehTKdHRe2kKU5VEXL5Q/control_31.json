He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. So I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author met David, they had a good time initially. Then during the drive home after coffee, David threw out a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this really off-putting and decided not to continue dating him. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of littering. It's illegal in many places and considered disrespectful to the environment. The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic but still care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So this isn't just a random judgment but based on their own values.\n\nDavid's reaction was casual, shrugging it off. That might have shown a lack of consideration or respect for others' feelings. The author felt it reflected David's character negatively. Even if littering isn't a huge crime, it's a behavior that can indicate a lack of responsibility or thoughtfulness. \n\nSarah thinks the author is being petty, but it's about personal values. People have different deal-breakers in relationships. For some, environmental care is important. The author didn't mention other serious issues, just the littering incident. Since David was casual about it, maybe he's done it before, which the author might see as a pattern.\n\nThe author didn't confront David about it during the dates except for the immediate reaction, and then ended things before a third date. They didn't lie; they told Sarah the truth about why they weren't interested anymore. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. It's their right to have personal boundaries based on their values. Littering is a choice that shows disregard, and if that's a problem for the author, it's valid for them to not pursue a relationship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
