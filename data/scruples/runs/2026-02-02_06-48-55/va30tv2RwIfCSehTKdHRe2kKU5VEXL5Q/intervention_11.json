He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author met David, they had two good dates, but when he threw out a McDonald's cup while driving, the author lost interest. David seemed nonchalant about it. The author's friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether littering is a valid reason to end a potential relationship. Littering is an environmental issue, but is it a deal-breaker? The author isn't an eco-activist, just someone who cares about not trashing the planet. The act of littering shows a lack of respect for the environment, which could indicate a disregard for others' well-being or responsibility. \n\nBut is that enough? The author might be overreacting, especially since Sarah thinks it's petty. On the other hand, how someone handles small actions can reflect their values. If the author values environmental care, then David's action might have clashed with that value. It's a personal choice, but does that make the author wrong for feeling that way?\n\nAlso, David's nonchalant attitude might have made the author feel like he was okay with being irresponsible. In a relationship, shared values are important. If littering is a red flag for the author, then it's reasonable to end it. However, someone else might not see it as significant. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author didn't even mention the littering during the third date, which could mean they were already making up their mind. Maybe they should have addressed it directly to see how David would respond. But maybe they didn't because they knew it would be a problem. It's a judgment call. \n\nIn the end, personal values and red flags are subjective. If the author's values include environmental care, then their reaction is valid. The friend's opinion is just one perspective, and the author has the right to prioritize their values. So, the author isn't in the wrong because it's their personal choice based on their values.\n"
