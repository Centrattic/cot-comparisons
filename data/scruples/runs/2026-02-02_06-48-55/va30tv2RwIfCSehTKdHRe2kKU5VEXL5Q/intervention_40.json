He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. The situation is that the author met David, they had a good time on a couple of dates, but then David littered an old McDonald's cup while driving, and the author lost interest. The friend Sarah is upset, thinking it's a petty reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that littering is a red flag for them. They mention they care about recycling and not trashing the planet, even if they're not an eco-activist. The act of littering was casual, which made them lose interest. On the other hand, Sarah thinks it's a small issue compared to how well they were getting along.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. I should think about whether littering is a valid reason to end a budding relationship. Personal values play a role here. If someone's character traits, like respect for the environment, are important to the author, then it's a valid reason. But others might see it as too minor, especially if there are no other red flags.\n\nAlso, the fact that David was nonchalant about it suggests it's a habit, not a one-time mistake. The author might be prioritizing personal values over the potential of a good relationship. However, it's their choice in a partner. People have different deal-breakers. Littering could indicate a lack of consideration for others and the environment, which might affect the author's perception of David's character.\n\nSarah's reaction is typical of a friend who thinks the author is overreacting. But the author isn't obligated to ignore their feelings just because others think it's trivial. So, the answer would depend on whether the author's reasoning is justified based on their values. Since the author felt it was significant, they aren't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
