He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy named David who littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue the relationship because of that. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it was a character issue.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the core of the issue. Littering is against the law in most places and is generally considered disrespectful to the environment and others. The author mentions they're not an eco-activist but still care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So, the act of littering, especially done casually and without remorse, is a red flag for the author. \n\nThe key points here are the author's personal values aligning with respecting the environment, and the fact that David's action was not just a one-time mistake but done in a way that suggests it's a regular habit (he was nonchalant about it). The author felt it reflected on David's character, which is a valid perspective. People often break up over differences in values or behaviors they find unacceptable, even if others might see it as trivial. \n\nSarah's reaction that it's \"petty\" might come from not seeing the significance of the act, but the author's reasoning is based on their own principles. It's important to respect personal boundaries and values in relationships. Since the author didn't feel comfortable continuing the relationship after that incident, it's their right to make that choice. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over this. Since it's a matter of personal values and they communicated their discomfort, the author isn't being unreasonable. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
