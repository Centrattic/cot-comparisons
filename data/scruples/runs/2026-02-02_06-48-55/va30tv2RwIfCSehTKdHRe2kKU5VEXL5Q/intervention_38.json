He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is dating David, and they had a good time on their first two dates. Then, during the second date, David throws away a McDonald's cup out his car window. The author is upset by this and decides not to continue the relationship, even though their friend Sarah thinks it's too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is saying that littering, especially being nonchalant about it, made them lose interest. Sarah, the mutual friend, thinks it's a petty reason. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending things over this.\n\nLittering is generally considered a negative behavior. It's illegal in many places and seen as irresponsible. The fact that David did it casually might be a red flag for the author. People have different values and dealbreakers. For some, environmental consciousness is important, so littering could be a dealbreaker. Others might not see it as a big issue compared to other traits.\n\nThe author isn't an eco-activist but still cares about not trashing the planet. So their reaction is based on personal values. The key here is whether this action is a valid reason to end a relationship. Since relationships are based on mutual values, if one person's behavior conflicts with the other's values, it's reasonable to reassess compatibility.\n\nSarah, as a friend, might not see it as a big deal because she's not in the same position. But the author's personal experience and feelings are valid. They can choose to end the relationship if it's a dealbreaker. The littering incident revealed something about David's character that the author found incompatible with their own values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to make decisions based on their values. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
