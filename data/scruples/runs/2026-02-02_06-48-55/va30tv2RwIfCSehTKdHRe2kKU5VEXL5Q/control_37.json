He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about someone ending a potential relationship because the guy littered. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to date someone who litters. \n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. The author met David, went on two dates, liked him, but then during the drive home after the second date, David threw a McDonald's cup out of the window. The author found this unacceptable and decided not to continue the relationship. David didn't seem to care, just shrugged it off. The author isn't an environmental activist but does care about recycling and not trashing the planet. The mutual friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty and not giving David another chance over something small.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the action (littering), the reaction (author losing interest), and the friend's opinion. The author is questioning if their reaction is justified. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering values. People have different values. Littering is a common issue, but some might see it as a minor transgression while others see it as a sign of disrespect for the environment and possibly for others. The author mentions that David was casual about littering, implying it's a habit. That could be a red flag for someone who values environmental responsibility.\n\nAlso, in relationships, people often end things over things that clash with their personal values. If the author values respect for the environment, then David's action could be a deal-breaker. The author isn't making a big environmental statement but is bothered by the act itself. The friend Sarah sees it as petty, but that's a different perspective. \n\nThe author didn't confront David immediately but ended the relationship after the third date, which they didn't mention the littering. The author felt the act showed something negative about David's character. Whether that's a valid reason depends on how important the issue is to the author. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because personal values play a big role in relationships. If someone's actions conflict with your core values, it's reasonable to step back. Littering is a sign of carelessness, which might indicate other issues. The author isn't being irrational; they have a valid reason based on their principles. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
