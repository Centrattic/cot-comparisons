He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy named David who littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue the relationship because of that. Their friend Sarah thinks it's a stupid reason, but the author feels it was a deal-breaker.\n\nFirst, I should consider the importance of littering as a character trait. Some people might see it as a minor issue, just a bad habit, while others might view it as indicative of a lack of respect for the environment or general irresponsibility. The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic, but they care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So for them, this was a red flag.\n\nThen, there's the reaction of the author. They didn't confront David immediately but later decided not to pursue a third date. Sarah thinks they're being petty, but the author felt it showed something negative about David's character. The key here is whether the action (littering) is a significant enough issue to end a budding relationship over.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Littering is generally frowned upon, even if it's not a criminal act. It's considered rude and inconsiderate. If someone does that, it might reflect poorly on their character in the eyes of others. The author's reaction might be valid if they value responsibility and consideration for public spaces.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one instance of littering isn't enough to judge someone's entire character. Maybe David was just having a bad day or was in a rush. The author could have addressed it directly to see if David was willing to change. However, the author felt it was a deal-breaker, which is their right if it conflicts with their values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending things over this. Since the author has the right to their own standards in a relationship, and littering is a common enough issue that others might share this perspective, it's more likely that the author isn't wrong. They are prioritizing their values and how they feel about the person's behavior.\n"
