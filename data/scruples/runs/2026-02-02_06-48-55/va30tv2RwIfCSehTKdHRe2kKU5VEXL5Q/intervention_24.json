He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The author met David, they had a good time, but then David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author lost interest, ended the relationship, and now their friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally frowned upon. It's an environmental issue and shows a lack of respect for public spaces. The author isn't an eco-activist but still cares about not trashing the planet. David's casual attitude about littering might reflect his character, like being inconsiderate or disrespectful. \n\nThe author's decision is based on a core value\u2014caring about the environment. Even if it seems like a small thing to some, personal values are important in relationships. People often break up over things that others see as trivial. The friend Sarah's reaction might be because she doesn't see littering as a deal-breaker. But the author felt it was a red flag. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had the right to decide that this behavior was incompatible with their values. David did something that the author found unacceptable, and they chose to end the relationship. There's no indication the author made a scene or was cruel; they just ended it after the third date without confronting David harshly. The friend's judgment of being \"bitchy\" could be a reflection of differing opinions on what's important. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their values. The answer should be B.\n"
