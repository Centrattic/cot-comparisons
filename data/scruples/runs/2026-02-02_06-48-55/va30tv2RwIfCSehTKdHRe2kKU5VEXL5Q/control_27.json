He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author met David, they had a good time on two dates. Then, during the drive home, David littered an old McDonald's cup. The author was bothered by this and ended the relationship without mentioning the littering. His friend Sarah thinks it's petty. The author's issue is that David's casual attitude about littering made them lose interest.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Littering is illegal in many places and considered rude. It reflects on someone's character, showing disrespect for the environment and public spaces. The author isn't an eco-activist but still values recycling and environmental care. The act of littering, especially being nonchalant about it, might indicate a lack of consideration, which is a valid personal dealbreaker.\n\nSarah's argument is that it's a small thing after they got along well. But personal values and dealbreakers vary. If someone's behavior conflicts with your core values, it's reasonable to end the relationship, even if others see it as trivial. The author isn't making a grandiose claim but stating a personal preference based on observed behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values. It's about personal compatibility and respect for shared environment. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
