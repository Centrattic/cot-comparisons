He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone who ended a relationship because their date littered. The person, David, threw a McDonald's cup out of the car window after getting coffee. The author felt that this action made them lose interest, even though they had been getting along well otherwise. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty to end things over littering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and values. Littering is a common issue, but not everyone might see it the same way. The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic but care about recycling. So maybe for them, littering is a red flag. It's about respect for the environment and personal habits. If someone is careless with trash, it could reflect their character in terms of responsibility and consideration for others.\n\nThen there's the context of the date. The littering happened after a nice dinner and coffee. The author might have felt that this action was a sign of David's character, showing a lack of care. Even if it seems small, in a relationship, small actions can indicate bigger issues. The author didn't confront David about it during the date but later decided to end things, which might be because they felt uncomfortable addressing it directly or didn't want to make a scene.\n\nSarah's reaction is interesting. She thinks it's a silly reason because they were getting along well. But maybe Sarah doesn't value environmental responsibility as much, so she sees it as trivial. The author's friend might not understand why the littering was a deal-breaker, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. People have different priorities in relationships.\n\nAlso, David's nonchalant attitude is important. He shrugged off the littering, which could imply that he does it often. If someone is indifferent to littering, it might suggest a disregard for societal norms and environmental impact. The author might feel that this behavior is incompatible with their own values.\n\nIn relationships, red flags can be personal. What one person sees as a minor issue, another might see as a major problem. The author isn't being \"bitchy\" for having those values. It's about compatibility. If David's actions clash with the author's principles, then it's reasonable for them to end the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a decision based on their own values and what they find acceptable in a partner. It's their right to choose based on their personal standards, even if others don't see it the same way.\n"
