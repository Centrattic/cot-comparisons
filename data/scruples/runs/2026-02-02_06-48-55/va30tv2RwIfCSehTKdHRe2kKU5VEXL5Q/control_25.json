He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking things off with David because he littered. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and David had a good time on two dates, but the third date was ruined when David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author didn't mention the littering incident when ending things but later explained it to their friend, Sarah. Sarah thinks the author is being too petty.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is wrong. The key points here are about the significance of the littering. Littering is an environmental issue, but the author isn't an eco-fanatic. However, they do recycle and care about not trashing the planet. From the author's perspective, David's casual attitude towards littering indicated a lack of care for the environment, which made them lose interest. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a potential relationship over this? Well, values and personal principles can be deal-breakers for some people. Littering might seem trivial to others, but if someone's actions conflict with your values, it's understandable to reconsider the relationship. The author didn't act out of anger but lost interest due to David's behavior. \n\nSarah argues it's a petty reason, but that's a subjective opinion. The author's reaction is based on their personal values, which is a valid reason. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
