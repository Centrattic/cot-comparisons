He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. The situation is that David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window during their date. The author felt this was a deal-breaker, while their friend Sarah thinks it's petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, littering is an environmental issue and can be seen as disrespectful or careless. If someone's actions show a lack of consideration for the environment, that might be a red flag for some people, especially if they value sustainability or responsibility. The author mentions they recycle and care about not trashing the planet, so this action probably clashed with their values.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that littering is a common issue and not necessarily a major character flaw. People might make small mistakes, and maybe the author is overreacting. Sarah's friend thinks it's a minor thing compared to other potential issues. But the key here is the author's personal feelings and how it affected their perception of David's character. The fact that David was nonchalant about it might have amplified the negative reaction, as it shows a lack of awareness or disregard for others' opinions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over this. Since the author has the right to their own values and feelings, it's not necessarily wrong to prioritize their personal standards. However, others might think it's too trivial. The answer hinges on whether the action was significant enough to justify the decision based on the author's values. Since the author is justified in feeling that their values were disrespected, it's more about personal choice rather than being wrong.\n"
