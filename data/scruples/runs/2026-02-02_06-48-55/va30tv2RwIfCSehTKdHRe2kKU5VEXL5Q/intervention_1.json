He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. So the situation is that they met David, had a few dates, but during the second date, David threw away a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author found that really off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. The friend Sarah thinks it's too petty, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They mention that they're not an eco-activist but they do recycle and care about not trashing the planet. So for them, littering is a deal-breaker. It's about values and character. They found his casual attitude towards littering unattractive, which made them lose interest. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues it's a small thing considering how well they were getting along. The key here is whether littering is a significant issue in a relationship. The author is making a judgment based on one action, which might seem minor to others. But if someone's values are important to them, it's reasonable to prioritize that. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If someone's personal values and standards are about respecting the environment, then it's their right to choose not to continue a relationship because of that. The author isn't being malicious; it's a matter of personal ethics. However, some might argue that one instance isn't enough to judge someone, but the author witnessed it firsthand and saw his nonchalant attitude, which could indicate a pattern.\n\nIn terms of relationship decisions, people often have their deal-breakers, and as long as the author isn't being unreasonable (like overreacting to a minor infraction), it's their choice. Since the author isn't an eco-fanatic but still cares about not trashing the planet, it's a valid reason. The author isn't being wrong for prioritizing their values. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
