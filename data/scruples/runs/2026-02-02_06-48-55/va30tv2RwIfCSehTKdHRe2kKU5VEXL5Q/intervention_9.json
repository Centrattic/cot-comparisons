He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The author's friend Sarah thinks they're being petty, but the author felt that the littering incident revealed something about David's character that they found unattractive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met David, had a good time on two dates, but during the drive after dinner, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author finds this behavior unacceptable, even if they're not an eco-activist. They ended the relationship, and Sarah is criticizing them for being too harsh over a small issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I should consider both sides. On one hand, littering is an environmental issue, and some might see it as a minor transgression. On the other, values and personal principles can influence relationship decisions. People have different deal-breakers, and respecting individual choices is important. The author isn't making a big deal about the environment otherwise but found David's casual attitude towards littering off-putting. It's about character judgment based on an action that shows disregard for public spaces.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to end things over values they find important. The author isn't being hypocritical here. Sarah's criticism might stem from not seeing littering as a significant issue, but the author's reaction is valid because it's about their personal standards. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong since it's their right to choose partners based on their values.\n"
