He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking off the relationship because David littered. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and David had a good time on their first two dates. The issue arose when David threw away a McDonald's cup out of the car window during their drive. The author found this behavior unattractive and lost interest, leading to breaking things off. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, littering is generally considered a negative behavior, but it's not a crime in all places. However, the key here is the author's personal reaction. They mention they're not an eco-fanatic but care about not trashing the planet. The act of littering, especially in a casual, nonchalant way, makes the author question David's character. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship is based on personal values. People have different deal-breakers. For some, environmental responsibility is important. The author isn't making a moral judgment on a larger scale but is acting based on their own standards. \n\nSarah's opinion that it's petty might be valid, but it's also subjective. What's a small issue to one person could be a red flag for another. The author isn't being malicious; they're following their instincts about compatibility. \n\nDavid's behavior showed a lack of consideration, which can be a deal-breaker. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to decide who they want to be in a relationship with based on their own principles.\n"
