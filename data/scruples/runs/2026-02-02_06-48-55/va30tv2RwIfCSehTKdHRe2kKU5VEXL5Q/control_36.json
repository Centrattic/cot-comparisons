He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met David, they had a good time on the first dates. Then during the drive home, David throws a McDonald's cup out the window when they get coffee. The author is upset by this act of littering and decides not to continue the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty and they should have given David another chance. The author is conflicted because they think littering reflects on David's character, but Sarah says it's a small thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the act of littering, the author's reaction to it, and whether it's a valid reason to end things. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing this issue.\n\nI should consider that people have different values and deal-breakers in relationships. Littering is illegal in many places and is considered disrespectful to the environment. If someone's actions show a disregard for the environment or public spaces, that might affect how others perceive them. The author mentions they care about recycling and not trashing the planet, so to them, this is a significant issue.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one act of littering isn't a big deal. Maybe David was having a bad day or was careless once. But the author felt it showed his character, and they lost interest. Personal values and deal-breakers vary, so it's subjective.\n\nThe author isn't being overly judgmental for a major offense but is acting on their own values. They didn't confront David about it, which could have led to a discussion, but they felt it was a deal-breaker. The friend's opinion is that it's petty, but the author's reasoning is based on their personal standards.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for having different values and choosing not to pursue a relationship with someone whose behavior they find unacceptable. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
