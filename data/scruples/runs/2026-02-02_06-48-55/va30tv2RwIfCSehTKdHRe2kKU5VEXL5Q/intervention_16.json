He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation involves David littering during a drive-thru, which made the author lose interest in him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social aspects. Littering is generally considered a negative action. It's not just about the environment but also about respect for public spaces and responsibility. The author mentions they're not an eco-activist but still care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So for them, this was a red flag.\n\nThen there's the reaction of their friend Sarah, who thinks it's petty. That's a common point in these kinds of questions. People might argue that littering is a minor issue compared to other potential deal-breakers. But others might say that values and how someone treats the environment reflect on their character and habits.\n\nThe key points are: The littering happened in a public place, David was nonchalant about it, which suggests it's a regular habit. The author felt it affected their view of David's character. They ended the relationship before a third date, not giving him another chance. The question is whether ending the relationship over this is justified.\n\nSome might argue that the author is right to prioritize shared values. If someone's actions show a disregard for the environment, it could lead to conflicts in a relationship. On the other hand, some might say it's an overreaction because littering is a common issue and not a severe character flaw.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. Littering laws vary, but generally, it's frowned upon. The author's disapproval is a personal value judgment. Whether that's a valid reason to end a budding relationship is subjective. The fact that the author lost interest after seeing David's casual attitude might indicate that the author values responsibility and respect for the environment, which are important to them.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is not in the wrong. Personal values and how someone treats the environment can be significant in a relationship. The nonchalant attitude towards littering might reflect a lack of consideration, which the author found unattractive. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
