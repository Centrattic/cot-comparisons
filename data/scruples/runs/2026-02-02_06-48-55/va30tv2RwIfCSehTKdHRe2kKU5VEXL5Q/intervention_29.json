He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The scenario involves David littering during a date, which made the author lose interest. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of littering. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally frowned upon. It's a matter of environmental responsibility and respect for public spaces. The fact that David did this casually, without hesitation, might reflect his attitude towards such issues. The author isn't an environmental extremist but does care about recycling and not actively harming the planet. So this isn't just about being a tree-hugger; it's about personal values.\n\nNext, the context of the dates. They had two good dates, but the littering incident was a turning point. The author didn't confront David until after the fact, and when he shrugged it off, it made them uncomfortable. The author then ended the budding relationship on the third date, without mentioning the littering. The friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I should consider if the author's reasoning is valid. Littering is a clear action that shows disregard for the environment and public spaces. If someone values environmental responsibility, this could be a deal-breaker. The author isn't judging David for a major ethical violation but for an action that reflects on their character and habits. \n\nHowever, some might argue that littering is a minor issue compared to other potential red flags. But the author's reaction isn't just about the act itself\u2014it's about David's casual attitude towards it. This indifference might indicate a lack of consideration or respect, which can be a bigger red flag in a relationship. \n\nThe friend Sarah's perspective is that the author is being petty, but the author's stance is about personal principles. The key here is that the author isn't making a huge deal about a one-time mistake; instead, they're concerned about a habit (David throwing out the window nonchalantly) that suggests a pattern of behavior. \n\nIn relationships, values and habits matter. If someone's actions consistently show disrespect for environmental norms, that can be a valid reason to reassess the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values over the opinions of a friend who doesn't share them. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
