He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person met David through a friend. They had a couple of good dates. Then during the drive home after dinner, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author was disturbed by this and ended the relationship on the third date. Their friend thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it was a character issue.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. Littering is illegal in many places and is considered environmentally harmful. It's a matter of respect for public spaces and consideration for others. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The action of littering, especially being casual about it, seems to have made the author lose interest because they saw it as a reflection of David's character.\n\nThe friend argues that it's a small thing, but the author felt it was significant. Personal values and character traits are valid reasons for ending a relationship. If someone's actions conflict with your values, it's reasonable to part ways. Littering could indicate a lack of consideration, which might be a deal-breaker for some. There's no right or wrong in feelings, but the question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author didn't confront David about the littering but still ended the relationship. They might have considered that it's not worth bringing up if it's a red flag. The friend's criticism is about being \"petty,\" but the author's perspective is about respecting shared values. Since personal values are subjective, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own standards.\n"
