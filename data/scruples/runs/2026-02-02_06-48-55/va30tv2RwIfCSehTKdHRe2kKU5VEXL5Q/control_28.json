He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author met David, they had a good time on dates, but when he littered after getting coffee, she lost interest. She didn't mention it when turning down the third date. Her friend Sarah thinks she's being petty.\n\nSo, the key points are: David littered, the author found it off-putting, she ended the relationship because of it, and her friend disagrees. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so.\n\nPersonal values play a big role here. Littering is an environmental issue, and for some people, it's a deal-breaker because it reflects someone's character or responsibility. The author isn't an eco-fanatic but still cares about not trashing the planet. She felt it showed something about his character. On the other hand, others might see it as a minor issue, especially if the rest of the relationship was good.\n\nThe author's friend argues it's petty. But whether that's valid depends on perspective. If someone values environmental responsibility, then it's a legitimate reason to not continue a relationship. It's about personal boundaries and what one considers important in a partner. The author isn't wrong for having her own standards. People have different deal-breakers\u2014some might care about punctuality, others about honesty. In this case, littering is a behavior that reflects on someone's consideration for the environment and public spaces, which can be significant for the right person.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her decision is based on her personal values and the way David handled the situation (nonchalant littering) affected her perception of his character. It's subjective, but she's not wrong to prioritize her own values in a relationship.\n"
