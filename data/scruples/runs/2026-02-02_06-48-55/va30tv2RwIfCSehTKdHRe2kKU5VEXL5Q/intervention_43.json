He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them breaking things off with David because he littered during their date. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: They met David through a mutual friend Sarah. They had a couple of good dates, but during the drive home after their second date, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this really unattractive and it made them lose interest. They ended things on the third date without mentioning the littering. Sarah is upset, thinking it's a petty reason, but the author is conflicted.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over David's littering. Let's consider different angles.\n\nOn one hand, littering is a negative behavior. It's illegal in many places and harmful to the environment. The author isn't an eco-activist but values not actively trashing the planet. David's casual attitude about littering could indicate a lack of environmental responsibility or consideration for others. In a relationship, shared values are important. If respecting the environment is a core value for the author, David's actions might have clashed with that, making it a deal-breaker. Plus, David's nonchalant reaction suggests he might not think it's a big deal, which could lead to ongoing issues if they dated further. The author might not want to be in a relationship with someone whose behavior they find unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that littering is a relatively minor issue compared to other red flags in a relationship. Sarah's perspective is that the author is being petty over \"one little thing.\" People can have different priorities; maybe the author is overreacting. Also, David might have littered in a moment of carelessness rather than it being a consistent, major habit. The author didn't give David a chance to explain or change, which could be seen as not being fair. Relationships require communication and understanding, so ending it without addressing the issue directly could be seen as abrupt.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't mention the littering when they ended things. They just said they didn't think it would work out. So maybe they felt it was too much to handle without a direct confrontation. However, some might argue that if it's a significant issue affecting their feelings, they should have communicated it. But the author's reason for ending it is valid to them because it's about their values and how they perceive David's character.\n\nAnother point: littering isn't just about the environment; it's also about consideration for others. If someone litters, they're affecting the community and making others clean up. The author might see this as a lack of respect, which is a big turn-off in a potential partner. Values like respect and responsibility are important in a relationship, so this could be a legitimate reason to part ways.\n\nIn terms of social norms, littering is generally frowned upon. Even if Sarah thinks it's petty, the author's reaction is within their personal boundaries. People have different deal-breakers, and if something as seemingly minor as littering reveals a larger character flaw (like disregard for rules or others' environment), it's not unreasonable for the author to prioritize their values.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal values and how David's actions affected their perception of his character. While others might see it as a small issue, in the context of a relationship, it's a valid reason to choose not to continue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
