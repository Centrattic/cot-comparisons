He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that they met David, had a good time on dates, but then he littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found that unattractive and decided not to continue the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to hear my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Littering is a bad habit and can have negative environmental impacts. If someone is casual about littering, it might indicate a lack of consideration for others or the environment. The author didn't mention being an environmental activist, but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So the act of littering, even if it's not a huge offense, could be a deal-breaker for the author because it's about personal values and character. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah thinks it's too small a reason to end a potential relationship. Maybe she believes that littering is a common mistake and not indicative of a bigger issue. But for the author, the way David did it\u2014nonchalant and shrugging it off\u2014might show a disregard for social norms or responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, people often prioritize different things. If respecting the environment is important to the author, then it's reasonable for them to not want to continue. Values can be a significant factor in compatibility. So, the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for choosing to end things based on that. \n\nHowever, some might argue that littering is a minor issue compared to other potential red flags. But since the author felt it made them view David's character negatively, it's their personal choice. The key here is that the author isn't being judgmental for the sake of it, but it's about their own standards. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on their values, and it's their right to choose partners who align with those values.\n"
