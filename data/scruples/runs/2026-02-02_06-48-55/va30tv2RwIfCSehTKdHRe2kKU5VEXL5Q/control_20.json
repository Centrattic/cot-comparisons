He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The situation is that David littered on their date, which made the author lose interest. They had a good time otherwise, but the littering was a dealbreaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, littering is a negative behavior that reflects on someone's character. The author isn't an eco-activist but still cares about environmental issues. It's reasonable for them to find littering unattractive or indicative of poor habits. The fact that David was nonchalant about it might suggest he does it regularly, which could be a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say it's a minor issue compared to other potential problems. Sarah thinks the author is being petty, arguing that it's a small thing to base a relationship on. However, the author mentions that the littering made them question David's character, which is a valid personal opinion. People have different values, and for some, respect for the environment is important.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't making a big deal about it beyond their own feelings. They didn't confront David aggressively but felt it was enough to end the budding relationship. Since personal preferences in a partner are subjective, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue if this behavior conflicts with their values. The answer should be B (No), because it's their right to decide based on their own standards.\n"
