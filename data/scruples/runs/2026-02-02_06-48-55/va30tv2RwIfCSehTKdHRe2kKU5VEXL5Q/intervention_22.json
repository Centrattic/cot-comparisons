He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking off a relationship because the guy littered. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met David, they had a good time on dates, but during the drive home, David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this unacceptable and ended the relationship, even though their friend Sarah thinks it's too petty. The author isn't an environmental extremist but does care about recycling and not trashing the planet.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, littering is generally frowned upon, but maybe the author overreacted? Sarah's perspective is that it's a small issue compared to other possible red flags. The author didn't mention the littering when ending the third date, so maybe they were being unfair to David by not addressing it directly. Also, one incident might not be enough to judge someone's character entirely. People can have bad habits without being malicious.\n\nOn the flip side, the author has the right to their personal values. If they care about environmental responsibility, seeing someone litter could be a deal-breaker. David's casual attitude might indicate a lack of respect for the environment or others, which the author might find incompatible. Everyone has different deal-breakers; for some, littering isn't a big deal, but for others, it's a sign of poor character.\n\nIs it reasonable to end a relationship over one instance? It depends on context. If David is known to litter often, maybe. But the author only saw it once. However, the casualness suggests it's a habit. The author might feel that values like respect for the environment are important in a partner. \n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have talked to David about it and given him another chance. But they didn't, so Sarah might think that's unfair. However, the author might have done that if David had responded differently. Since David shrugged it off, maybe it's a lost cause.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, littering is illegal in many places and is considered disrespectful. So, the author's reaction isn't unreasonable. However, it's a personal choice about what's acceptable in a partner. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether littering is a valid deal-breaker. Since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure, I need to decide if the author's actions are justified. If values align with environmental care, then no, they're not in the wrong. But if it's seen as too petty, then yes. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made a judgment based on their values. It's their right to choose a partner who shares their principles. David's action showed a disregard for the environment and others, which is a legitimate concern. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
