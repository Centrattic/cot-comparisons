He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. The situation is that David littered during a drive-thru, which the author found really off-putting. They had a good time on the first dates, but the littering incident made the author lose interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Littering is generally seen as a negative behavior, but is it a deal-breaker for a relationship? The author isn't an environmental activist, but they value recycling and caring about the planet. So this person's actions conflicted with the author's values, even if it's not a huge issue for everyone.\n\nSarah, their mutual friend, thinks the author is being petty. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Personal values and deal-breakers vary. For some, littering might be a small thing, but for others, it's a red flag about someone's character or responsibility.\n\nThe author didn't confront the issue during the third date but ended things. The problem here is that the author might have valid reasons based on their personal standards. However, the friend argues it's too trivial compared to the good times they had. But the author felt the littering showed a disregard for others' environment and maybe a casual attitude toward rules.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're acting on their values. If someone's behavior conflicts with your principles, it's reasonable to step back. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because personal values are a valid basis for relationship decisions. Even if others think it's trivial, the author's feelings are valid. The friend might not see it the same way, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n"
