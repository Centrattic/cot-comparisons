He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. So, the main question is whether the author made the right choice or not based on David's littering behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and David were on a couple of dates, got along well, but then during a drive home after coffee, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this action really off-putting and decided not to continue dating him. The friend Sarah thinks the author is being petty over a small issue, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nNow, think about values and personal boundaries. People have different priorities in relationships. For some, environmental consciousness is important, while for others, it's not. The author isn't an eco-activist but still values recycling and not trashing the planet. David's casual attitude towards littering might indicate a disregard for public spaces or environmental impact, which the author finds unattractive. \n\nLittering is a common problem, but the act itself is a violation of social norms in many places. It's considered disrespectful and inconsiderate. The fact that David did it without hesitation and shrugged it off might suggest he doesn't see it as a big deal, which could be a red flag for someone who does. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues that this is a small issue compared to other possible deal-breakers. But the author's reaction is subjective. If someone's core values include environmental care, then this could be a valid reason to end things. The decision to continue or end a relationship is personal, and there's no universal right or wrong here. However, the author isn't being unreasonable for valuing respect for the environment and finding that behavior inconsiderate. \n\nThe key point is whether the author overreacted. Since the action was a direct reflection of David's habits and attitude, and it caused the author to lose interest, it's a matter of personal judgment. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to pursue a relationship with someone whose behavior conflicts with their values, even if others see it as trivial.\n"
