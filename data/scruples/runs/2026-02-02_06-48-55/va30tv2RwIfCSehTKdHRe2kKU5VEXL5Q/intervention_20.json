He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong, choosing between A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author met David, they had a good time on dates. But when driving home after dinner, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior unacceptable and decided not to pursue a third date. Sarah, the mutual friend, thinks the author is being petty. The author is unsure if they're wrong for ending things over this.\n\nSo the key points here are: David littered in a visible and casual manner. The author felt this reflected poorly on his character and decided it wasn't a good fit. Sarah thinks it's a small issue for breaking things off.\n\nI need to consider whether not wanting to continue a relationship over littering is a valid reason. Values and personal boundaries play a role here. Littering is illegal in many places and reflects a disregard for the environment and public spaces. For some people, this could be a deal-breaker because it shows a lack of respect for the community or the environment. Others might see it as a minor issue, especially if the person is otherwise good.\n\nThe author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. So it's a personal value. If someone's actions conflict with your core values, it's reasonable to question compatibility. David's casual attitude towards littering might indicate a pattern of careless behavior, which the author might not want in a partner.\n\nSarah's reaction is that the author is being \"bitchy\" for not giving another chance. However, the author didn't feel the need to explain it, just said it wasn't going to work. The author's decision is based on their own values, and it's their right to choose not to pursue a relationship if a partner's actions go against those values.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that littering is a common issue and not a major flaw. But if the author feels it's a red flag, then it's a valid reason. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. If David's actions show he doesn't care about environmental responsibility, and the author does, that's a significant difference.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values. They had a good time with David, but the littering incident revealed an incompatibility in values. It's not about being petty; it's about personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
