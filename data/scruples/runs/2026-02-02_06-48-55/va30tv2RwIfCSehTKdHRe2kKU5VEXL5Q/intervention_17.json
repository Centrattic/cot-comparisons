He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The story is about a guy named David who littered during a date, which caused the narrator to lose interest. The friend Sarah thinks the narrator is being petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The narrator isn't an eco-activist but does care about recycling and not trashing the planet. The littering incident happened in a car, where David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The narrator found this unattractive and a red flag. They ended the relationship before a third date. Sarah, their friend, thinks it's a silly reason.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Values here are subjective. Littering is a public issue, but is it a deal-breaker in a relationship? The narrator's reaction is based on personal values. They might see littering as a reflection of someone's character\u2014responsibility, respect for the environment, and consideration for others. On the other hand, Sarah argues it's too minor compared to other potential issues.\n\nI should think about societal norms. Littering is generally frowned upon, but some people might not take it as seriously. The narrator's perspective is valid if their values prioritize environmental responsibility. However, the friend's argument is that it's overreacting. But the narrator isn't just upset about the littering itself but David's nonchalant attitude, indicating it's a regular behavior. That suggests a disregard for social norms, which could affect compatibility.\n\nThe answer depends on whether personal values are a valid reason to end a budding relationship. Since the narrator feels strongly about it and it's a core value, their decision isn't wrong. They're not in the wrong for choosing to walk away from someone whose actions conflict with their values. So, the correct answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
