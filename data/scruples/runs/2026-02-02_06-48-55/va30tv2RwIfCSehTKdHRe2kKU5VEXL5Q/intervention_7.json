He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy named David who littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue the relationship because of that. Their friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it was about David's character.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author wasn't an eco fanatic but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. David threw a McDonald's cup out the window, which the author found unattractive and concerning. The author didn't bring it up during the third date and just ended things, which made Sarah question their decision.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reason for ending the relationship is justified. Littering is a matter of personal values and social responsibility. While it might seem small to some, it can be a deal-breaker for others. The author isn't saying David is a criminal or anything, but they felt it reflected on his character. \n\nSarah's perspective is that it's too minor an issue, especially since the dates were going well otherwise. But the author's reaction is about respect for their values. If someone does something that goes against what you personally value, even if it's not a big deal to others, it's reasonable to prioritize that. \n\nI should also think about the context. The littering happened in a public place, which can have environmental and cleanliness impacts. David's casual attitude suggests it's a habit, which the author might see as a lack of consideration. The author didn't make a big scene and only mentioned it briefly, so they didn't act out of anger or overreaction. \n\nIn relationships, people often part ways over differing values, even if those differences seem small. The question is whether the author's reason is valid. Since the user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion, I need to weigh the values against the friend's criticism. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because personal values are important in relationships. If David's behavior conflicts with what the author considers acceptable, it's their right to make that decision. Plus, the author didn't confront David aggressively, just expressed their discomfort. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
