He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who littered. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author met David, had a good time on a couple of dates, but when David threw a McDonald's cup out the window during a drive, the author lost interest. They ended things before a third date, and their friend Sarah thinks it's petty. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the values and principles here. Littering is a common issue, and people have different views on its seriousness. The author isn't an eco-activist but does care about recycling and not trashing the planet. For them, David's action was a deal-breaker. On the other hand, Sarah argues it's a small thing compared to other possible issues.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, littering is generally considered disrespectful to the environment and others. It's a matter of personal values. If someone values environmental responsibility, then finding littering unacceptable isn't unreasonable. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified based on their own values.\n\nThe author didn't make a big deal about it at the time but still ended the relationship without mentioning it. This could be seen as being evasive, but the action itself was the trigger for their loss of interest. The friend's criticism is about the reason being too small, but personal boundaries are subjective. What one person sees as a red flag, another might overlook.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to align on core values. If littering is a significant issue for the author, it's valid for them to prioritize that. They didn't overreact to a major ethical issue but rather a behavior that conflicted with their personal standards. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for choosing not to continue the relationship based on that action.\n"
