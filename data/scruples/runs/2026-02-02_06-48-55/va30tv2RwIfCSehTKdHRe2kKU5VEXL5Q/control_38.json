He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The scenario involves David littering during their date, which the author found off-putting. The friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal values and boundaries in relationships. Littering is a common issue, but whether it's a deal-breaker depends on individual perspectives. The author isn't an eco-activist but still finds littering unacceptable. They might value environmental responsibility, even if it's not their top priority.\n\nNext, the context of the situation: David threw away a McDonald's cup while driving. The author points out there were already cups in the console, which might imply David wasn't paying attention to keeping the car clean. His nonchalance in doing so could indicate a lack of consideration for the environment or public spaces. The author's reaction is about principle rather than a major ethical violation, but it's still important to them.\n\nSarah's perspective is that it's a small issue, but the author's discomfort stems from David's attitude. The key here is that the author feels it reveals something about his character\u2014maybe carelessness or disregard for others' values. Even if littering isn't illegal in certain places, it's a social norm that many people respect.\n\nI should also think about the bigger picture. In a relationship, people often look for compatibility in values. If the author values environmental consciousness and honesty (as shown by David's casual attitude), then this could be a valid reason to end things. The author isn't making a grand moral stand but following their own standards. Since the decision is based on their personal values and how it made them feel about David's character, it's a legitimate choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
