He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met David, they had a good time on a couple of dates. Then, during the second date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author found this really off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's too petty and that they should have given David another chance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending things because of this.\n\nI need to consider personal boundaries and how people view littering. Littering is generally considered a negative trait because it's environmentally harmful and shows a lack of respect for public spaces. The author mentions they're not an eco-warrior but still care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So, this incident might have revealed something about David's character that the author doesn't appreciate.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah argues it's a small thing, especially since the first dates went well. But the key here is that the author felt this act was a deal-breaker. Personal values and red flags can vary from person to person. If someone's actions show a disregard for certain values that the other person holds, it's reasonable for that person to reconsider the relationship. \n\nThe author didn't confront David about it during the date but still ended things later. Some might think it's a valid reason if it's a core value, others might see it as overreacting. However, the fact that the author felt this strongly suggests that it was a significant issue for them. \n\nIn relationships, people often have different deal-breakers. If littering is a reflection of someone's respect for others and the environment, it's a valid concern. Since the author clearly states that the action made them lose interest, and they chose to end it, their decision is based on their own values. So, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their values in a relationship.\n"
