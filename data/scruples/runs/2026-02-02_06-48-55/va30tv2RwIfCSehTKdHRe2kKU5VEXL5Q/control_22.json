He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy named David who littered during a date, and the author decided not to continue dating him. The friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels that David's casual attitude towards littering was a red flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, littering is an environmental issue, and some people might see it as a sign of disrespect for the environment or a lack of consideration for others. The author mentions they're not an eco fanatic but still care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So to them, this was a deal-breaker. On the other hand, Sarah argues that it's a small thing compared to other possible issues in a relationship. \n\nI should also think about the context. The littering happened during a date, which is a time when people are evaluating each other. The author felt that David's nonchalant attitude towards throwing out a McDonald's cup was indicative of his character. Even if it's a minor action, it might reflect a disregard for social norms or responsibility. However, others might say that one action shouldn't end a relationship, especially if there were other positive aspects. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is wrong for making that choice. Personal values and red flags are subjective. If littering is something that the author finds incompatible with their values, then it's reasonable for them to decide not to continue the relationship. It's about personal boundaries. The friend's opinion that it's petty doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; it's a difference in opinion about what's important in a partner.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's acceptable to have personal standards and values that influence relationship decisions. What one person considers a deal-breaker might not be for another, but the author isn't wrong for acting on their own values.\n"
