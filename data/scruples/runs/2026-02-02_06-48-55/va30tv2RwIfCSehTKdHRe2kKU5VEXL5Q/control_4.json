He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met David, they had a good time on dates. Then during the drive home, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior off-putting and ended the relationship. The friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, littering is generally considered a negative behavior. It's illegal in many places and harmful to the environment. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The key points here are the littering act itself and David's nonchalant attitude towards it. The author felt it reflected David's character, which is a valid concern in a relationship.\n\nRelationships often involve personal values and deal-breakers. If someone's behavior conflicts with the other person's values, it's reasonable for that to affect the relationship. The author's decision is based on David's actions, which they found unattractive and indicative of a disregard for the environment. The friend's opinion that it's a \"small thing\" might not consider the significance of values in a relationship.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize environmental values? Probably not. People have different deal-breakers. Even if littering isn't the most severe issue, it's a personal choice to end the relationship over it. The author explained their reasons clearly and felt it was important to their character assessment of David. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because personal values and deal-breakers are subjective.\n"
