He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author met David, they had a few good dates, but then during the second date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the car window. The author felt this was a deal-breaker because it showed a lack of care for the environment and maybe character. The friend Sarah thinks it's petty and they should have given David another chance. The author is now asking if they're the asshole for ending the relationship over this.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's personal values clashing with David's actions. Littering is illegal in many places, so maybe that's a red flag. The author isn't an eco-fanatic, but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. David's casual attitude towards littering might indicate a disregard for rules or respect for the environment, which the author finds unattractive. \n\nSarah argues it's a small issue compared to other potential problems, but the author felt it revealed something about David's character. The question is whether the author was wrong to end things. \n\nIn terms of societal values, littering is generally frowned upon. People have different deal-breakers in relationships. If someone's behavior conflicts with your values, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The author didn't make a big deal about it during the date, which shows they handled it maturely. They ended the relationship before things got more serious, which is responsible. \n\nSarah's criticism is about being \"bitchy\" and not giving David another chance, but the author had a valid reason based on their values. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because personal values and deal-breakers are subjective. Littering is a negative trait, and if it's a red flag for someone, ending the relationship is their choice.\n"
