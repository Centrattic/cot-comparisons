He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for breaking off the relationship because David littered.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author liked David initially, but when David threw a McDonald's cup out the window after getting coffee, the author lost interest. They didn't mention it to David before ending things. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty. The question is whether not wanting to continue dating because of littering is justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are personal values and how significant littering is as a deal-breaker. The author isn't an eco-activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. David's action was a one-time thing or a habit? The author mentions he shrugged it off, implying it's a regular habit. If someone's casual about littering, maybe it reflects their respect for others and the environment, which can be an issue in a relationship.\n\nBut is that enough to end things? People have different priorities. What's a deal-breaker for one might not be for another. The author felt it was a character flaw, so they're not in the wrong for prioritizing that. However, some might argue that it's a small issue compared to other potential problems in a relationship. But the author's reaction is subjective. They have the right to choose partners based on their values. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
