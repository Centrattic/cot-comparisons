He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending the relationship because the guy littered. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author liked David initially, but during a drive, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this really off-putting and decided not to continue dating him. The friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason and that the author is being too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the act of littering, the author's reaction to it, and whether that's a valid reason to end things. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally frowned upon. It's considered disrespectful to the environment and shows a lack of consideration for public spaces. \n\nThe author isn't an environmental extremist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The way David casually littered, without any remorse, made the author lose interest. The friend Sarah argues that it's a small issue compared to other potential problems, and the author is being too harsh. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, littering is a negative behavior. People have different values, and for some, environmental responsibility is a significant value. If someone's actions contradict your values, it can be a deal-breaker. The author's decision might seem petty to some, but others might agree that respecting the environment is important.\n\nIt's also about personal boundaries. The author felt that David's action revealed something about his character that they couldn't overlook. Even though Sarah thinks it's trivial, the author felt it was a red flag. Whether or not the author is in the wrong depends on whether their reaction is reasonable. Since littering is a common issue and can be seen as a sign of disrespect, the author's reason might be justified. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their personal values and the behavior they found unacceptable. Others might disagree, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values in a relationship.\n"
