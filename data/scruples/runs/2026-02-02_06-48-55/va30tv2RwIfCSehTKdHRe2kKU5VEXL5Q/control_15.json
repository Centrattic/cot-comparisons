He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person went on a couple of dates with David, they got along well, but during the second date, David threw away a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author found this behavior off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks they're being petty over a small issue, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nPersonal values and ethics play a role here. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally considered disrespectful to the environment and others. The author mentions they're not an eco-activist but still care about not trashing the planet. The act of littering here was done casually, which might indicate a disregard for societal norms or consequences. \n\nThe key points are that the author's decision is based on a value judgment. Personal preferences in partners can be about shared values. If someone values environmental responsibility, then littering could be a deal-breaker. The fact that David was nonchalant about it might have made the author view him as inconsiderate or lacking in responsibility, which can be valid reasons to end a relationship, especially early on.\n\nSarah's reaction is that it's a petty reason, but the author's reasoning is about character assessment. It's not about a trivial issue if it aligns with personal principles. The friend's perspective might not consider the significance of such actions in evaluating compatibility.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no absolute answer, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for valuing environmental consideration in a partner. People have different deal-breakers, and this seems like a reasonable one given the context. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
