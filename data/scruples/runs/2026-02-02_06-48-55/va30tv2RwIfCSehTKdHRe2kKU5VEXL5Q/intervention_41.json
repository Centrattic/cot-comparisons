He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because David littered. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and David had two dates, and they were getting along well. However, during the second date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of the window without a second thought. The author found this behavior unattractive and decided not to continue the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether littering is a valid reason to end a potential relationship. Littering is considered a negative trait by many people. It shows a lack of consideration for the environment and public spaces. The author isn't an eco-activist but still values recycling and not trashing the planet. The casual way David did it, without any remorse, might have made the author question his character. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that littering is a minor issue compared to other red flags. David might have had a slip-up, or it's a habit he could change. The author didn't confront David about it directly before ending things, which could mean they didn't give him a chance to explain or correct his behavior. But they did mention that after the incident, David shrugged it off, indicating he wasn't bothered by it. \n\nThe friend Sarah's opinion is that the author is being petty. However, personal values and deal-breakers vary. If someone's behavior goes against your principles, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. The author felt the littering was a sign of David's disregard for others' environment, which is a significant enough issue for them. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's values. If the author views littering as a reflection of someone's character and it made them lose interest, they aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their own values. On the flip side, if someone else doesn't mind that trait, they might not consider the author's reaction valid. But since the author is the one making the decision based on their own standards, it's their choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set their boundaries and make decisions based on what they find acceptable in a partner.\n"
