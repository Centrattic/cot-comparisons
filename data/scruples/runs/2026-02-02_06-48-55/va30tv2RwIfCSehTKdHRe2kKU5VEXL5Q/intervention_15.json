He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The story goes that the author met David, had a good time on two dates, but then during the car ride home, David threw a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior unacceptable and ended the relationship, but their friend Sarah thinks it's too petty.\n\nSo, the key points here are: littering is the issue. The author isn't an environmental extremist, but they care about not trashing the planet. The act of littering, especially done casually, made them lose interest. The friend argues it's a small thing, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's reaction is justified. Littering is illegal in many places and is generally seen as a negative behavior. It's a matter of personal values. The author might value environmental responsibility, and seeing someone they're dating litter could be a red flag for them. Even if others think it's trivial, personal boundaries in relationships are important. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one instance of littering isn't a deal-breaker. Maybe David had a bad day or was in a rush. But the author mentions that David was nonchalant about it, suggesting it's a regular habit. If someone is casual about littering, that does reflect on their character, especially regarding respect for public spaces and consideration for others. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that it's petty, but that's subjective. What one person finds trivial, another might find significant. In relationships, people often part ways over differing values or behaviors that clash with their principles. The author isn't making a grand environmental statement but is acting on a personal boundary. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their values over continuing the relationship. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion, I need to evaluate if their reasoning is valid. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers personal boundaries and respect. If the author felt strongly about it and it's a key part of their values, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's judgment is common in these stories, but the decision ultimately rests on the individual's comfort with the partner's behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting on their personal values and the behavior in question does reflect on character in a way that's important to them.\n"
