He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with David because he littered. So, the situation is that David threw a McDonald's cup out the window without a second thought. The author found that really off-putting, even though they were getting along well otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether littering is a valid reason to end a budding relationship. Littering is an environmental issue, but how significant is it in a relationship? The author isn't an eco-activist, but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So it's a personal value issue here. \n\nDavid's action showed a disregard for public cleanliness and environmental responsibility. The fact that he did it so casually, not even apologizing, probably made the author feel that he didn't share their values. Even if someone isn't an activist, respecting each other's values is important in a relationship. \n\nSarah thinks it's petty, but maybe that's because she doesn't see how important it is to the author. The author might be right to prioritize shared values. Littering can also indicate a lack of consideration for others, which is a character trait. If someone is okay with littering, what else might they do that's inconsiderate?\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a small incident and not worth ending a relationship over. But for someone who values environmental responsibility, it's a big deal. The author didn't mention it before the third date, which could be seen as not addressing the issue upfront. However, they might have felt uncomfortable bringing it up immediately. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for valuing environmental responsibility in a partner. If that's a deal-breaker, then they aren't in the wrong. It's about personal values conflicting with the partner's behavior. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
