He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for ending the relationship because David littered. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author liked David, had a good time on two dates, but during the drive home after dinner, David threw away a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this unacceptable and decided not to continue the relationship. The friend, Sarah, thinks it's petty, but the author feels it's about character.\n\nI need to consider personal boundaries here. Littering is illegal in many places, and it's also a sign of environmental disregard. The author mentions they care about recycling and not trashing the planet, so this action might have been a deal-breaker for them. Even if the friend thinks it's small, personal values play a big role in relationships. \n\nThe key points are: the author felt it was a character issue, found the action unattractive, and it made them lose interest. The friend is dismissing the reason as petty, but the author is standing by their decision. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's about their personal standards. If littering is a red flag for them, then they have the right to prioritize that. People have different values, and it's their choice who they want to date. The author isn't being unreasonable in their stance. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one instance isn't enough to end a budding relationship. But the author was clear that the action was casual and habitual, which implies it's a consistent behavior. So, the author might have a valid reason based on their values. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). They acted on their personal values and it's their right to decide who they want to be in a relationship with.\n"
