He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to decide whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author had a few dates with David, and they were going well. Then, during the drive home from coffee, David littered by throwing an old McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior unacceptable and ended the relationship, even though their friend Sarah thinks they're being petty.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. To figure this out, I should consider several aspects: personal values, social norms, and the context of the situation.\n\nPersonal values play a big role here. The author says they recycle and care about not trashing the planet, even if they're not an eco-activist. For someone who values environmental responsibility, seeing someone litter might be a significant red flag. It's about character and values alignment. If littering contradicts the author's values, then it's reasonable for them to feel it's a deal-breaker.\n\nSocial norms are also important. Littering is generally considered unacceptable in most societies. While it's not a criminal act in every place, it's frowned upon and seen as inconsiderate. People might have different thresholds for what they find unacceptable, but littering is often viewed as a sign of poor responsibility or disrespect for public spaces.\n\nThen there's the context. David's behavior was casual and nonchalant, which might exacerbate the issue. The fact that he shrugged it off and didn't seem to care suggests a lack of awareness or consideration, which could make the author question his character. The author mentions that this behavior made them lose interest, which is a personal reaction but valid in the context of a relationship.\n\nSarah's reaction is that the author is being petty. Friends might have different perspectives on what's a deal-breaker. However, the author's stance is about personal values, not just a minor inconvenience. The key here is whether the reason given is trivial or significant enough to end a budding relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of deal-breakers versus preferences. If littering is a deal-breaker for the author, then it's their right to prioritize that. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. If David doesn't share the author's environmental values, maybe they aren't compatible on a deeper level.\n\nBut could the author be overreacting? Maybe. If the author isn't an eco-fanatic, some might argue that littering, while unpleasant, isn't a major issue. However, the casual disregard for the environment might symbolize other negative traits, like irresponsibility or a lack of consideration, which are important in a partner.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision hinges on the author's values and how they perceive the significance of littering in a relationship. Since the author has a clear reason based on their own values and the context of David's nonchalant attitude, it's not necessarily wrong for them to end the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
