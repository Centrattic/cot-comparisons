He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending a relationship because the guy littered. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author of the post is someone who was on a few dates with David. They liked him initially but then were turned off by his littering. The friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels it's a character flaw.\n\nLittering is a minor act, but it can be a dealbreaker for some people. The key points here are the context of the relationship and the significance the author places on that action. The author mentions they're not an eco-activist, but they do care about recycling and not trashing the planet. So, for them, littering is a sign of disrespect towards the environment and possibly a lack of consideration for others. \n\nDavid's response was nonchalant, which might have made the author feel that he's indifferent to the impact of his actions. That could lead to the author questioning his character. Even though littering isn't a major crime, in a dating context, it's a personal choice about what's important in a partner. \n\nSarah, the mutual friend, thinks the author is being petty. But the author's reasoning is based on their values. It's about personal boundaries and what they find acceptable in a partner. The author isn't being judgmental about the act itself but is reflecting on how that action aligns with their own values.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their reaction is reasonable. Since they had the right to decide based on their values, and the act of littering is a personal choice that the author found unacceptable, it's not necessarily wrong. The friend's judgment isn't the same as societal judgment. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their preferences in a partner.\n"
