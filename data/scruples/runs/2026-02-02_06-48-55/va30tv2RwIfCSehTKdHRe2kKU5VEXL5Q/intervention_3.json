He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't want to continue dating David because he littered during a drive-thru. The author's friend thinks it's a petty reason, but the author feels strongly about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Littering is an environmental issue, but is it a deal-breaker? The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic, just someone who cares about not trashing the planet. So it's a personal value issue. The problem is that David was casual about it, which made the author question his character. \n\nNow, relationships often hinge on personal values. If something like littering, which reflects on someone's respect for the environment and public spaces, is a deal-breaker for the author, then they are within their right to make that choice. The author's friend thinks it's too small a reason, but that's a subjective opinion. \n\nAlso, the act of littering can be seen as a sign of irresponsibility or disrespect, which might affect how someone views their partner's character. The author didn't bring it up again during the third date but already made their decision. The friend's reaction suggests that others might not see it the same way, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether personal values are valid reasons to end a relationship. Since everyone has different priorities, the author isn't wrong for valuing environmental responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't being unreasonable for this personal choice.\n"
