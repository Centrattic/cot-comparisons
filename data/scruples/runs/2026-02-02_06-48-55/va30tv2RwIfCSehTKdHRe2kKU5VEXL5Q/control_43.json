He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The scenario is about a guy named David who littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author of the post decided not to continue the relationship because of this, and their friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author liked David initially, but the littering incident changed their opinion. They mention that David was nonchalant about it, which made it worse. The author isn't an eco-fanatic but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. Sarah argues that it's a small thing to break off a relationship over, especially since the first two dates went well.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B), I should consider both sides. On one hand, littering is a common issue, and some might see it as a minor infraction. Sarah's perspective is that the author is being unreasonable. On the other hand, the author's decision is based on a significant red flag for them. They felt it reflected on David's character, and the casual attitude towards littering made them lose trust or interest.\n\nValues and personal boundaries play a role here. If someone's actions violate another person's core values, it's reasonable for them to step back. The author isn't making a moral judgment but stating that this behavior is incompatible with their own standards. The key is whether the author's reaction is justified based on their principles. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether their decision is unreasonable. Given that personal preferences and values vary, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own standards. So, the answer would be B: No.\n"
