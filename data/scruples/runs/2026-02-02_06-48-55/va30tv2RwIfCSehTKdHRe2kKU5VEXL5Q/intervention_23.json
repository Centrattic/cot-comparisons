He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters. The author describes a situation where David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out of the car window. The author found this behavior unacceptable and decided to end the relationship, even though their friend thinks it's being petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Littering is illegal in many places and is considered a bad habit. The author isn't an environmental activist but cares about recycling and not trashing the planet. The act of littering, especially in a casual and nonchalant manner, might reflect on David's character. The author felt that this behavior revealed something about his character that they couldn't overlook, even though there were other positive aspects to their relationship.\n\nThe friend, Sarah, thinks the author is being overly sensitive, but personal values and deal-breakers vary. For some people, environmental responsibility is important in a partner. The author's decision isn't based on a major moral failing like abuse or dishonesty but on a habitual behavior that shows disregard for public spaces. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing this issue over the positive aspects of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't breaking any rules by ending the relationship because of a personal value conflict. On the other hand, the friend's perspective is that it's a minor issue. The key points are whether the author's reasons are valid. Since the author feels that David's behavior contradicts their values and that it affected their perception of his character, their decision isn't necessarily wrong. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a partner. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because it's about personal values and compatibility.\n"
