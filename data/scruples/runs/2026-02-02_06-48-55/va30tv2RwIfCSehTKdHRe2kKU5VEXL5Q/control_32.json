He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking things off with David because he littered. The situation is that they liked him, had a good time, but then he threw a McDonald's cup out the window after getting coffee. The author didn't like that and ended the relationship. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal values. Littering is illegal and harmful to the environment. The author cares enough about that to end a potential relationship. Is that a valid reason? Well, people have different standards. Some might think it's a small thing, others might see it as a character flaw. The key points here are that the littering was done casually, and the author felt it reflected poorly on David's character. \n\nAlso, David's reaction was nonchalant, which probably made the author feel like he didn't care about the environment or societal rules. That could indicate a lack of consideration for others, which is a red flag in a partner. The author isn't an eco-fanatic, but they do recycle, so it's part of their values. \n\nSarah's opinion that it's petty might be because she doesn't see littering as a big deal. But the author's reason is about mutual respect and shared values. If David can't respect basic rules like not littering, maybe they have other issues. \n\nIn relationships, people often break things off over different values or behaviors. Littering isn't a crime, but it's a sign of disrespect for public spaces and the environment. The author is acting on their values, which is their right. So, no, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
