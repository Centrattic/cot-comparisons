He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person met David, they had a couple of dates, and the author really liked him. But during the third date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found that really off-putting and decided not to continue the relationship. However, their friend Sarah thinks it's a petty reason to break things off.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of littering itself. Littering is generally considered a negative behavior because it harms the environment and is disrespectful to public spaces. The author mentions they're not an eco-fanatic but do care about not trashing the planet. So, the act of littering is a deal-breaker for the author, even if it's not a huge issue in the grand scheme of things. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over this. The author's friend says it's a petty reason, but the author felt it was about David's character. People have different values and priorities. If someone's behavior conflicts with the author's personal values, it's reasonable for them to decide it's not a good fit. \n\nBut then again, littering is a common issue. Maybe David made a mistake once, and the author is overreacting. The author didn't confront David about it during the date but later ended things without addressing it. However, the author explains that they were unsure how to react at the moment. It's possible they felt it was a significant character flaw that wasn't worth ignoring. \n\nIn relationships, people often have red flags. Littering could be a red flag for some, indicating a lack of consideration for others and the environment. The author isn't saying David is a terrible person, but this one action made them question his character. On the other hand, others might argue that a single instance isn't enough to judge someone's overall character. \n\nThe author's friend, Sarah, is in the middle, suggesting the author is being petty. But the author's reasoning is based on personal values. It's hard to say if the author is wrong for holding those values. If the author cares about environmental issues, it's valid for them to find littering unacceptable in a potential partner. \n\nAlso, considering that the author didn't confront David immediately but ended things later, maybe there was an opportunity to discuss it. However, the author might have felt uncomfortable bringing it up. It's possible that if they had talked about it, David might have apologized or the author might have found it less important. But the author's decision to end it wasn't based on a single action alone\u2014it was a combination of the action and David's nonchalant attitude towards it. \n\nIn conclusion, values and personal boundaries are subjective. The author is not wrong for prioritizing their values and finding littering unacceptable in a partner. Even if others see it as petty, it's their right to decide what's important to them in a relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
