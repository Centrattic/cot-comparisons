He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone breaking off a relationship because their date littered. The author didn't mention it directly but ended the third date, and the friend thinks it's a petty reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider values and social norms. Littering is generally frowned upon, but is it a deal-breaker? The author isn't an eco-activist but finds the act unattractive and a character flaw. They lost interest because of that action. The friend argues it's a small thing compared to other possible issues.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, personal preferences matter in relationships. If someone's values or behaviors clash with yours, it's reasonable to end things. Littering shows a disregard for the environment and public spaces. The author might feel that someone who doesn't care about their surroundings might not have the same respect in other areas. But others might see it as overreacting. \n\nThe key points here are the context of the littering and the reaction. The guy threw out a McDonald's cup casually, showing indifference. The author's reaction was based on personal values and the other person's nonchalance. The friend thinks it's petty, but the author feels it reflects on the person's character. \n\nIn such cases, it's about personal boundaries. If the author feels this action is enough to break off the relationship, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. It's their prerogative to choose partners who align with their values. However, some might argue it's an overreaction. But given that the author felt it was a significant issue, they're not wrong. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
