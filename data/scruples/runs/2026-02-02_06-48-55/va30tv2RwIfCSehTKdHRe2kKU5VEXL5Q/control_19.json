He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said \u201coh sorry, here you go\u201d and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn\u2019t know how to react. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so I just said something like \u201cdid you really just throw that on the road?\u201d And he nonchalantly was like \u201cyeah\u201d and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I\u2019m not a \u201csave the earth\u201d eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn\u2019t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn\u2019t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn\u2019t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don\u2019t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it\u2019s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there\u2019s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I\u2019m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I\u2019m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to date someone who litters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met David, they had two dates where they got along well. Then, on the drive home after the second date, David littered by throwing a McDonald's cup out the window. The author found this behavior off-putting and decided not to pursue a third date. Their friend Sarah thinks it's petty and stupid to end things over something like that, but the author feels it reflects on David's character.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is not in the wrong if their reason for ending the relationship is valid. Littering is a public issue, and it's about personal values. The author isn't an environmentalist, but they care about not trashing the planet. David's casual attitude suggests it's a regular habit, which the author finds unattractive.\n\nSarah argues it's a small thing, but the author is making a judgment based on character. People have different deal-breakers. For some, littering is a red flag because it shows disrespect for the environment and possibly for others. The author isn't making a big deal out of a one-time mistake; they observed a consistent behavior that clashed with their values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer depends on whether the reason is justifiable. Since the author's values are about caring for the environment and David's actions contradict that, it's a valid reason. The friend's opinion doesn't make it wrong; people have different priorities. So the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue the relationship over this issue.\n"
