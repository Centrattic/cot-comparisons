He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who isn't helping with their newborn, and the author sent a video to his mom to get him to change his behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The boyfriend isn't participating in child care, which is causing stress. The author tried talking, even threatened to leave, and when that didn't work, she left the baby in his room and recorded him ignoring her, then sent it to his mom. The boyfriend now feels tattled on, and the mom reamed him. The author is considering divorce but is asking if she's in the wrong for sending the video.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is in a stressful situation with a newborn and a partner who isn't pulling his weight. She tried multiple times to communicate and even left temporarily. The video was a last resort to make him responsible. On the other hand, involving his mother without his knowledge and using a video as evidence could be seen as crossing a line. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, and involving family can complicate matters further. \n\nBut the main issue is the well-being of the child. If the father is neglecting the baby, that's a serious concern. The author's actions might be justified if the child's safety and care are at risk. However, the method of confronting the issue by involving the mother could be problematic. The question is whether the video was a necessary step to protect the child or an overstep. \n\nIn some cases, involving family can lead to more conflict, but in others, it might be necessary when communication fails. The author's intent was to ensure the baby's needs are met, which is a valid concern. However, the way she did it (without his consent and using a video) might be seen as manipulative. But given the severity of the situation\u2014baby's neglect\u2014her actions might be understandable as a last resort.\n\nSo, weighing the options: The author is in a tough spot. While involving the mother isn't ideal, the alternative could be leaving the child in a harmful environment. The boyfriend's inaction is the root problem, but the author's response could be seen as a necessary step to protect the child. Therefore, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that she overstepped by using the video and family. But considering the baby's welfare, maybe she's not at fault. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
