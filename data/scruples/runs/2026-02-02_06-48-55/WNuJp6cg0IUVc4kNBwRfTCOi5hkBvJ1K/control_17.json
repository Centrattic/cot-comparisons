He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him ignoring their crying baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays games, only helps when the author tells him, and then even asks why she can't do it. They've talked about it multiple times, and there's been some improvement but then relapse. The author tried leaving the baby in his room, then went to the gas station. When she came back, the baby was crying and he wasn't helping. She took a video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset, and the question is if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's actions were to involve the mother-in-law after repeated failed attempts to get help. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful towards the baby, which is a serious issue. The author's decision to document the incident might be seen as a last resort to get help, but she bypassed direct communication with her partner and went to his family instead.\n\nOn one hand, involving a parent (his mother) could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the couple was supposed to handle their own issues. The act of sending a video might be seen as manipulative or using guilt, especially if taken out of context. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is neglecting the child, which is a serious concern. The author might be in a stressful situation where she's desperate and feels unsupported.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on societal norms and how the action is perceived. In some contexts, involving family to address neglect could be justified, especially if the child's well-being is at risk. However, the method of tattling might be seen as undermining the relationship rather than addressing the issue directly. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is the root problem, so the author's action might be a response to that. However, sending a video without discussing it with her partner first could be problematic. She might have considered other steps, like counseling or legal measures if it's a matter of child neglect. \n\nIn terms of accountability, if the author's intent was to protect the child and the video accurately shows the neglect, then her action might be justified. But if the video was misleading or the context was not fully explained, that could make her actions wrong. The user mentions the boyfriend says the video was out of context, so maybe the video doesn't show the full picture. However, the user's explanation does suggest that the boyfriend was neglecting the baby when she was crying, which is a key point. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong) because the neglect of a child is a serious issue, and the mother-in-law's intervention might be necessary. However, the method could be questioned. But in terms of right or wrong, the neglect is the boyfriend's fault, so the author's action to seek help through his mother might be understandable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
