He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother about his neglect towards their baby. So the situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their daughter, and the author is really stressed. She tried to get him to help, he didn't, and she took a video to show his mother. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is neglecting his responsibilities as a parent. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and he's only improved temporarily. She felt at her wit's end and decided to go to the gas station to test if he would take care of the baby, which he didn't. Then she sent the video to his mom. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's trying to protect her child and hold her partner accountable. But involving the mother might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have escalated to a therapist or a mediator first instead of his mom. However, the mother did step in and reamed him out, which might have caused some family tension. But the boyfriend's neglect is a serious issue. The act of tattling might be seen as overstepping, especially since they're adults and supposed to handle their own conflicts. But the mother-in-law's involvement could have been necessary if the father is not taking responsibility. \n\nAlso, the video being taken might be seen as a form of evidence to show the reality of the situation. However, without context, maybe the video was misleading. The key point here is the child's well-being. If the father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, maybe the mother-in-law's intervention is justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were driven by concern for the child, but the method might not be appropriate. However, given the seriousness of the neglect, her actions might be seen as necessary to get help. It's a tough call. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. So the answer is B (No).\n"
