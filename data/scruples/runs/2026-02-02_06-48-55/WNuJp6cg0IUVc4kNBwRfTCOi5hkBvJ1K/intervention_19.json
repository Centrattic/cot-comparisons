He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom showing him not caring for their baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old habits. She feels overwhelmed and decided to stage a test where she left the baby with him and recorded when he ignored the baby. Then she sent the video to his mom, which led to the mom confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether her actions were justified. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is clearly struggling with her partner's lack of involvement. She's the one mainly caring for the baby, which is extremely stressful. The fact that he's not helping and even avoiding taking care of the baby when it's crying is a serious issue. The author's actions might be seen as a last-resort attempt to get help, either from her partner or from his family.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a video to his mother without his knowledge could be seen as manipulating the situation. Even though her intentions were to help the baby, the method involved deception. She staged the situation by putting the baby in his room and then leaving to create a scenario where he would be left alone. This could be considered an invasion of privacy or a setup. Also, involving the mother without consulting the boyfriend might have breached trust, which could damage their relationship further.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. While the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, the author's response might not be the healthiest way to address it. Instead of directly confronting the issue with her partner or seeking couples' counseling, she escalated the situation by involving his mother. This might not resolve the problem in the long term and could lead to more conflict within the family.\n\nHowever, considering the stress and sleep deprivation she's experiencing as a new mother, her actions might be understandable as a cry for help. The key question is whether she had other options. She did try talking to him multiple times and he didn't change, so she felt like she was out of options. But maybe there are other steps she could take, like involving a counselor or seeking legal advice, rather than involving the mother.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic and potentially harmful to the child. The author, as the mother, is responsible for the child's well-being, so her concern is valid. However, the method she used to address the issue might be questionable. While her intentions were good, the approach could be seen as underhanded, which might make her somewhat in the wrong, depending on the context.\n\nBut considering the extreme stress she's under and the fact that the father isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, some might argue that she's not in the wrong because she's acting in the child's best interest. However, others might say that she should have handled it differently without involving his mother without his consent.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. It depends on whether the means justify the ends. If the video did lead to the mother-in-law addressing the issue, maybe it was justified. But if the author used manipulation, then she could be in the wrong. However, given the severity of the situation (a child not being cared for), her actions might be seen as necessary, even if the method was questionable.\n"
