He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a parent whose boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. He's been neglecting her, playing video games instead, and only helps when prompted. The user tried talking to him repeatedly, but he relapses into old habits. In a moment of desperation, she left the baby in his care, faked leaving, and then recorded a 10-second video of him ignoring the baby when she cried. She sent this video to his mother, who confronted him, leading to his anger towards her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending the video. Let's consider various angles. First, the mother is clearly distressed about her partner not fulfilling his parental duties. The issue is that he's not helping with the baby, leading to her exhaustion and possible breakdown. The act of recording the video was a way to show his mother what's happening, but it's a private moment captured without consent.\n\nOn one hand, she's trying to get help for the baby's well-being and her own mental health. She's in a vulnerable position as a new parent and might feel she's out of options. The video serves as concrete evidence of his neglect. However, she didn't confront him directly first, and involving his mother without his knowledge could be seen as tattling, which might strain family relationships and could be considered a breach of trust between partners. \n\nAlso, the method of faking leaving and then recording might be manipulative. Even if her intent was good, the action could be seen as deceptive. Additionally, sending a short video snippet might not capture the full context, leading to misunderstandings. The boyfriend's claim that the video is out of context could be valid if there were other factors at play that she didn't show.\n\nBut considering the ongoing neglect and the impact on the child, her actions might be justified as a last resort to protect the baby. The key factors here are the well-being of the child versus the integrity of the relationship and the boundaries between partners and their families. The mother might feel she's in the right because the baby's needs are paramount, but using her mother-in-law as a mediator without direct communication could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while the intent is to protect the child, the method used involves deception and third-party involvement without prior direct confrontation. This could be seen as overstepping, especially since they were already in communication about the issue. However, given the severity and duration of the neglect, her actions might be understandable as a desperate measure.\n"
