He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author, the girlfriend, ends up sending a video of his neglect to his mom without his consent. The boyfriend is upset about that, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The boyfriend isn't taking care of their daughter, which is causing the author a lot of stress. They've tried talking about it multiple times, and the boyfriend's behavior hasn't changed. The author decides to put the baby in his room and leave, then takes a video when she comes back to find him ignoring the baby. She sends this video to his mom, leading to the mom confronting him. The author is now considering divorce but is questioning if she was wrong to tattletale.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is dealing with a very stressful situation, a new baby, and a partner who isn't pulling his weight. The neglect could be emotionally and physically taxing for the mother. The author tried to communicate and address the issue multiple times without success. Her actions, while perhaps not ideal, stem from a place of desperation to protect her child and herself.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a video of the situation to his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach of trust. It's true that the author might be in a vulnerable position, but involving his mother directly could have consequences on their relationship. The boyfriend might feel that the author didn't respect his privacy or that she handled the situation in a way that bypassed their communication. However, the core issue is the neglect of the child, which is a serious matter.\n\nThe key here is whether the mother's actions were justified given the circumstances. The father's behavior could be considered neglectful, and the author's goal was to get help for her child. The method might be questionable, but the intent was to protect her daughter. In some cases, involving family might be seen as a necessary step when communication within the couple isn't working. However, there's a fine line between seeking support and overstepping boundaries.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms and typical approaches to such situations. In many cases, people might advise trying other methods before involving in-laws, like couples counseling or legal steps if necessary. But in this case, the author has tried multiple times to address the issue directly. The father's return to old habits after a week of improvement might indicate a pattern of not taking responsibility.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing the need to protect the child with maintaining trust and respecting the partner's autonomy. The author's actions might be seen as a last resort, especially if she felt she couldn't trust him. However, the method of involving his mother without his knowledge could be problematic. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because the father's behavior is the root issue, and her actions were to safeguard the child. But there's also the aspect of how she handled the situation, which could affect their relationship dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach might have been unideal, the underlying issue of the father's neglect is significant. The decision to involve his mother might be seen as a desperate move to address the problem when all else has failed. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The answer depends on whether the action was justified by the necessity to protect the child versus the breach of trust by not discussing it directly with her partner first.\n"
