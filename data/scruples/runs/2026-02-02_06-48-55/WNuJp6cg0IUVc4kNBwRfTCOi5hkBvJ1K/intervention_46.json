He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her boyfriend are parents to a 6-month-old. He's not helping with the baby, she's overwhelmed, they've talked about it multiple times without success. She staged a situation where she left the baby in his room and then came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, which led to her mom confronting him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mother and the video.\n\nThe author is considering divorce but is wondering if she was wrong for sending the video. The user initially thought she might be in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nI need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by involving the mother and using the video. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is clearly stressed and the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties. The situation is affecting their relationship and her well-being. She tried talking multiple times, and the boyfriend didn't consistently help. Her actions might be seen as desperate to get the issue addressed. Sending the video to his mother could be a way to get him to take responsibility, and maybe the mother's intervention was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, involving his mother directly might be seen as overstepping in some relationships. People might have boundaries about who handles family matters. Also, the act of staging the situation (putting the baby in the room and leaving) and then recording it could be considered manipulative or deceptive. The boyfriend might feel betrayed that his mother was involved without his consent, especially if that's not something agreed upon.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention was to protect the baby and hold her partner accountable. If the boyfriend isn't helping, the baby's needs are not met, which is a serious issue. The author might feel that her usual methods aren't working, so she took a drastic step to ensure the baby's well-being.\n\nBut then, bypassing the boyfriend and going to his mother could be seen as not giving him the chance to address the issue on his own. It might damage their relationship further by inserting another party without discussing it first. Also, the video could be viewed as evidence, but was it done in a way that's fair? The staging part is key here\u2014if she set up a scenario to catch him, that could be seen as unfair or as a trap.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The boyfriend is not fulfilling his duties, and the author is the one handling everything. That's a heavy burden, and she's at a breaking point. Her actions might be justified from her perspective, but the method of involving his mother might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have considered other steps first, like counseling or legal measures if divorce is an option.\n\nCultural and relationship norms also play a role. In some cultures, involving in-laws might be more acceptable, while in others, it's frowned upon. Since the boyfriend is upset about the mother being involved, it suggests that this step was unexpected or unwelcome to him.\n\nSo, balancing the need to address the neglect of the child against the method used. The author's action, while coming from a place of desperation and concern, might have been a breach of trust. However, the underlying issue of her partner's neglect is serious and needs to be addressed, regardless of the method.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action of sending the video to his mother without his knowledge is considered crossing a boundary, then perhaps she is in the wrong in terms of the method, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, if the primary concern is the well-being of the child and her own mental health, some might argue that the ends justify the means.\n\nHowever, from a relationship standpoint, involving the mother without discussing it with the boyfriend first could be seen as a breach of trust. It might have been better to seek another avenue, like couples counseling or involving a professional. Using the mother as a mediator without the boyfriend's consent might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer is a bit of both. But since the question is a binary choice (A or B), I need to decide. The key here is that while the author's actions were driven by a valid concern, the method of addressing it by involving the mother and staging a situation might be considered overstepping. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intent was to solve a real problem.\n"
