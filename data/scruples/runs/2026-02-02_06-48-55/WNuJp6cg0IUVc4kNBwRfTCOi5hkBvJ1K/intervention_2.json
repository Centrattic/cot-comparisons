He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, refuses to take care of her, plays video games instead, and only helps when the author tells him to. They've tried talking about it multiple times, and he improves briefly but then goes back to his old ways. The author tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, which made her mom call him out. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe main points to consider: The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, the author is clearly stressed and has tried to communicate multiple times without success. The author's action of sending the video to his mom could be seen as a last resort. But is it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the mother is a parent of the boyfriend, so involving her might be a way to get through to him. The author did try all other avenues first. However, bypassing direct communication and involving his mother could be seen as undermining the relationship. Also, the video is a private moment, and sharing it without consent could be problematic. \n\nBut then, the baby's well-being is at stake. If the boyfriend isn't stepping up, the author has a responsibility to act in the baby's best interest. The video serves as evidence of neglect. However, the method of confronting the issue through the mother might not be the best approach, but given the circumstances, the author might feel it's necessary.\n\nIs the author wrong for sending the video? It's a tough call. On one side, she's acting to protect her child. On the other, she's involving his mom and using a video which could be seen as manipulative. But considering the boyfriend's pattern of behavior and the author's repeated attempts to resolve the issue, maybe her actions were justified. The key here is whether the action was necessary to protect the child. If the boyfriend had been neglecting the child, then the mother's involvement might be warranted. However, the method of using a private video might be crossing a line, but given the context of a neglected child, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, some might say that the author shouldn't have gone to his mom, as it's a breach of privacy and could strain family relationships. Others might argue that the child's welfare is paramount, and the boyfriend's refusal to help justifies that action. In many cultures, involving family in such matters can be controversial, especially if done without the partner's consent. But when there's a child involved, the priorities shift towards ensuring their safety and well-being.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the severity of the situation. Since the baby is being neglected, the author's actions, while maybe not the best method, were driven by a desire to protect her child. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the manner in which she did it (using a video and involving his mom) could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the circumstances, it's understandable. So likely, the answer is B.\n"
