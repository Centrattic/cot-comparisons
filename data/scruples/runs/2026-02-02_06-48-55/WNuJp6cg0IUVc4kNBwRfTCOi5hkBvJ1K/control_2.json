He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He's playing games instead, only responding when the baby is crying if the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, and there's a pattern where he improves for a week then goes back. The author tried leaving the baby with him and taking a short video when he ignored the baby. She sent it to his mom, leading to her confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset with her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for tattling. Let's break it down. \n\nThe boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent. The author has tried to address it directly, but it's not working. She's at her breaking point. She took a video as evidence and sent it to his mother, which led to his mother reprimanding him. The boyfriend is now upset because he feels the video was taken out of context and that she involved his mom.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in terms of actions, she's trying to get help for the baby. The boyfriend is neglecting his duties, which is a serious issue. However, involving his mother might be seen as stepping over a boundary. But considering the circumstances\u2014baby's wellbeing is at stake\u2014it's a different scenario. The mother's intervention did lead to the boyfriend being confronted, which might be necessary if he's not responding to direct communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried other avenues first, like couples counseling or involving a mediator. However, given that they've tried talking multiple times without success, her frustration is understandable. The act of tattling might be a cultural issue too; some people might see it as a last resort when the parent's well-being is in danger.\n\nThe key factors here are the neglect of the child and the author's intent to protect the baby. Sending the video was a way to document the neglect and get support. While involving the boyfriend's mother might not be the ideal solution, the primary concern is the child's welfare. The boyfriend's reaction to the video being out of context is something to consider, but if the video clearly shows him ignoring a crying baby, the context might be clear enough.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are driven by a need to ensure her child's well-being. The boyfriend's neglect is the root issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since she's the one bearing the brunt of the child care and has tried to resolve it through discussion without success. The act of sending the video to his mother is a last-ditch effort to get help, which, while possibly crossing a boundary, is motivated by the child's needs. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
