He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after multiple attempts to address it, the author felt desperate and sent a video as proof.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for five years and has a newborn. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is causing significant stress for the author. They've discussed it multiple times, and he's made temporary improvements but relapsed. The author felt she couldn't trust him, so she staged a situation to prove his neglect.\n\nSending the video to the mother might be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. The boyfriend now feels that his mother was involved without his consent, which could strain their relationship further. However, the mother's reaction was to confront him, which might have led to some positive change temporarily.\n\nThe key point is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. While the boyfriend's behavior is concerning and neglectful, the author's method of addressing it by involving his mother without his knowledge could be seen as manipulative or an overstep. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like couples counseling or legal advice, especially since she's considering divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions stem from a place of desperation and a desire to protect her child. The neglect is real, and she felt she had exhausted other options. However, involving the mother without discussing it with him first could be seen as bypassing their communication and trust issues.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends. The author's intentions were to ensure the baby's well-being, but the method might have been problematic. So, while the boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior is a major issue, the author's choice to involve his mother without transparency could make her partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, she is in the wrong for the method she used, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
