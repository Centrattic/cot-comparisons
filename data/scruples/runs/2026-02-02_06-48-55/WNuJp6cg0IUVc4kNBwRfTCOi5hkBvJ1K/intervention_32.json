He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, especially when she's crying. The author tried talking to him multiple times, and when she finally put the baby in his room and left, he ignored the baby. She recorded a video and sent it to his mom, which led to the mom confronting him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue, especially with a child involved. Neglecting a child's basic needs like feeding, comforting, or attending to their cries can be considered a form of child neglect, which is a legal and ethical concern. The mother-in-law's reaction might have been harsh, but the underlying issue is the boyfriend's neglect.\n\nThe author's action was to inform the mother about her son's behavior. While it's true that she went to the gas station instead of leaving permanently, her intention was to gather evidence of his neglect. Using a 10-second video to show his inaction when the baby is crying seems like a justified step when other methods have failed. However, involving the mother directly might be seen as bypassing the partner, which could be a point of contention. But given the severity of the situation\u2014child neglect\u2014the priority is the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was to protect the child. While direct confrontation with the boyfriend didn't work, escalating to the mother might be necessary if the boyfriend is not responsive. However, there might be cultural or family norms about how to handle such issues. But from an ethical standpoint, ensuring the child's safety and care is paramount. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, and the author felt she had no other options left after multiple attempts.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong (Answer B) because she took action to address a serious neglect situation when other methods failed, prioritizing the child's needs over the relationship.\n"
