He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a video of their boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for five years, had a daughter six months ago, and since then the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, only helps when the author tells him, and doesn't hold the baby unless she's calm. The author tried multiple times to talk to him, he improves briefly but then goes back. She decided to put the baby in his room, left to get gas, and came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to the mom confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is clearly stressed and dealing with a partner who isn't fulfilling his parental duties. The baby's well-being is at risk. Taking a video as evidence might be seen as necessary to protect the child. On the other hand, involving the boyfriend's mother without talking to him first could be seen as bypassing him, which might be considered tattling. However, the boyfriend hasn't responded to previous communication, so maybe the author felt it was the only way left.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. In many cultures, parents are expected to share their concerns with each other first, but if one partner is unresponsive, especially regarding child welfare, others might step in. The key here is the baby's safety and well-being. The author's actions could be justified as protecting the child, especially if the boyfriend was repeatedly neglecting his duties. However, sending the video to his mother might not be the best approach, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. It's a last resort after all other methods failed. So the author might not be in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
