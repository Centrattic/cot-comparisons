He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, and after the birth of their daughter six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays games and only takes care of her when she's screaming if the author tells him to. Even then, he questions why the author can't do it. He holds the baby only when it's calm and he's watching TV, and he doesn't take turns at night when the baby cries. They've discussed it multiple times; he improves briefly but then goes back. The author tried leaving to go to the gas station, but when she returned, the boyfriend was ignoring the crying baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, which led to his mom scolding him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's lack of support in parenting, the author's attempts to address the issue directly without success, and the decision to tattle on him by sending a video to his mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, parents are expected to share responsibilities, especially after a child is born. The boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful and not contributing to caregiving, which is a significant problem. The author has tried to talk to him, even to the point of considering divorce. The last effort was to leave and check, then document the issue. Sending the video to his mom could be seen as a desperate move, but maybe justified given the severity of the situation. \n\nHowever, involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent might be crossing a boundary. People might argue that it's a private matter and that the mother should be informed, but others might say it's an invasion of their relationship. The boyfriend is upset because she took the video out of context, which could mean he feels the video was misleading. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014his repeated neglect, the author's exhaustion, and the baby's well-being\u2014it's possible the author's actions were in the best interest of the child. The question is whether the ends justify the means. In some cases, involving family for the child's safety is acceptable. The author didn't falsify the evidence; she just showed a real instance. \n\nOn the other hand, using a video to tattle might seem like an escalation. They should have addressed the issue together first, maybe with counseling. However, since he keeps reverting to old habits despite her direct talks, she might have felt it was the only way left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The boyfriend is clearly not fulfilling his parental duties, which is a big issue. The author's action might be seen as necessary to get his mother's intervention. But others might think she should have handled it within the relationship without involving family. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. If I consider the child's well-being and the boyfriend's consistent neglect, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the method of involving family without discussion is considered inappropriate, then maybe she is. Since the options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong), I think the correct answer is B, no, because the author's intent was to protect the child and the boyfriend's behavior is inexcusable.\n"
