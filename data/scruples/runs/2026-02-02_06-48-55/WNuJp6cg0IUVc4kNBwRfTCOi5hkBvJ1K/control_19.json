He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, opting to play video games instead. The mother has tried talking to him multiple times without success. She even staged a situation where she left, went to the gas station, and took a video of him ignoring the baby. She sent the video to his mom, who then confronted him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Let's consider the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend not fulfilling his parental duties. The mother is trying to get help, but when direct communication fails, she uses a more drastic measure. Sending the video to his mother could be seen as a breach of privacy or overstepping, depending on cultural norms. However, the mother's actions are driven by the baby's well-being and her own exhaustion from lack of help. The boyfriend's response is to be upset about the video and the involvement of his mother, which might indicate he's defensive or unwilling to confront the issue directly.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mother's priority is her child's welfare. If the father isn't taking care of the baby, she's trying to make him accountable. On the other hand, involving his mother could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if it's not a common practice in their family. However, given the severity of the situation (a child's needs being ignored), some might argue that the ends justify the means. The video is a factual recording, so \"taking it out of context\" might not be accurate if it's a true representation of his behavior. The boyfriend's unwillingness to improve despite multiple warnings adds to the justification for her actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, there's a balance between protecting the child and respecting the partner's autonomy. Since the boyfriend isn't responding to her requests and the situation is affecting the child's care, the mother's action could be seen as necessary. However, the method of involving his mother might have been a misstep, but not necessarily making her wrong. The answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because her intention was to ensure the baby's well-being, even if the approach was contentious.\n"
