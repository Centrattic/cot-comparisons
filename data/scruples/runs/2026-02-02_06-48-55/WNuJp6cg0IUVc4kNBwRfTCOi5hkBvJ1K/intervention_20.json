He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author tried multiple times to address this, and when she left the baby in his room to check on him, he ignored the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's intention was to show her boyfriend's mother the reality of the situation, which she claims he's been ignoring. By sending the video, she's involving the mother, which the boyfriend now sees as \"tattling.\" The question is whether her actions were justified or if she overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, she's dealing with a serious issue\u2014her partner not fulfilling parental responsibilities. The baby's needs are critical, and she's struggling alone. Sending the video to the mother might be a way to get support or make the boyfriend realize the severity through his own family. In that sense, her actions could be seen as necessary to protect the child's well-being and her own mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother without consulting the boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships have boundaries, and bringing in family might be considered an intrusion unless agreed upon. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken without his knowledge, and sharing it with his mom could be seen as underhanded. The phrase \"tattling\" implies that she's reporting him in a way that's not direct, which can be hurtful and damaging to their relationship.\n\nAlso, the method she used\u2014leaving the baby in his room to check if he'd respond\u2014might be ethically questionable. Testing a partner's responsiveness in such a critical situation could be risky, especially with an infant. If the baby had been harmed, that would be a serious consequence.\n\nThe question then is about the balance between the urgency of the issue and the method used to address it. The author's actions were driven by desperation and a lack of resolution from previous attempts. However, involving the mother directly might have been a last resort that crossed a line in terms of relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. While the issue of parental neglect is serious, the method of addressing it by involving family without direct communication might be seen as the wrong approach. The author could have considered other steps, like involving a mediator, seeking counseling, or legal advice, before escalating to involving the mother. However, given the context of repeated failures to resolve the issue, her actions might be understandable from her perspective.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. If the author's actions were necessary to protect the child and her own well-being, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if there were more appropriate steps she could have taken without involving the mother, then she might be. Since the situation is a last-ditch effort after multiple failed attempts, and the issue is about the baby's care, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. However, the method of involving the mother without direct confrontation could be seen as the wrong approach, making her in the wrong.\n"
