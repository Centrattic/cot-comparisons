He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple dealing with childcare responsibilities after their daughter was born. The boyfriend isn't helping, and the author sent a video to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend refuses to care for the baby, only helps when prompted, and ignores her when she cries. The author tried discussing it multiple times, even mentioning divorce, but he relapses. Then she stages a situation by leaving the baby in his room and recording a video when he ignores her. She sends the video to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic. Not helping with a newborn is a serious issue. However, the author's approach might be questionable. Sending a video without discussing it directly with her partner first could be seen as crossing a line. Involving his mother might not be the best approach, as it could strain family relationships and might not resolve the core issue. Also, staging the situation by putting the baby in the gaming room and then going to the gas station could be seen as manipulating the scenario to get evidence, which might not be fair.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is clearly in a stressful and potentially harmful situation. She's trying to make her partner take responsibility. The act of sending the video to his mother might be a last resort, given that prior attempts to communicate have failed. However, the ethical dilemma here is whether involving the mother is the right approach. In some cultures, involving family might be common, but in others, it's seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author's intention was to make her partner accountable, but the method might not be the most constructive. Instead of involving the mother, maybe seeking couples counseling or legal advice would be better. The act of staging the situation and recording could be seen as manipulative, even if her intentions are good. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the method she used, even though the problem with her partner is valid. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of how she handled it, not the situation itself.\n"
