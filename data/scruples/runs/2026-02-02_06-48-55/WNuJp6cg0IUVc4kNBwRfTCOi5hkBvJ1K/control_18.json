He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video of their boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, and since the baby was born six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, ignores the baby's crying, and only helps when the author insists. They've discussed it multiple times, but he keeps reverting. The author tried a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then taking a video when he ignored the baby. She sent it to his mom, which led to his mom confronting him, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's behavior towards the baby, the author's actions, and whether those actions were justified. The boyfriend's neglect is a major issue, especially since caring for a newborn is crucial. The author has tried to communicate, but he hasn't changed. She's at her breaking point, leading her to take drastic steps.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The act of sending the video to his mother could be seen as tattling, but the context is serious\u2014child neglect. The mother-in-law intervened, which might have been necessary if the father wasn't responding to any other measures. However, involving the boyfriend's mother without discussing it with him first could be seen as bypassing their relationship and possibly escalating the conflict. \n\nBut the video was only 10 seconds long, and the author's intention was to show the neglect. If the video was a genuine example of his behavior, then it's a valid action to protect the child. The boyfriend's reaction might be defensive, but the underlying issue is his consistent neglect, which is the real problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried other methods, like seeking professional help or mediation, before involving his mother. However, given that he's been unresponsive to all other communication, the author might feel this was the only way left to make him take notice. \n\nIn terms of ethics, protecting the child's well-being is a priority. The author's actions, while possibly harsh, were aimed at ensuring the baby's needs were met. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning and could have serious consequences if not addressed. \n\nThe mother-in-law's involvement might have been a trigger for the boyfriend's anger, but if the neglect continues, the author might need to consider legal steps or further intervention. The central question is whether the author's action was justified given the situation. Since the boyfriend's behavior is harmful and he's not improving despite multiple warnings, the author's tattling could be seen as a necessary action to protect the child, even if it strained their relationship further.\n"
