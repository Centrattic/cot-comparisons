He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, only when prompted. The author tried talking, but he keeps going back to old habits. She put the baby in his room, went to the gas station, came back to find him ignoring the baby, took a video, and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with a significant issue: her partner not fulfilling parental responsibilities. They've tried talking, he's made temporary changes but reverted. She's exhausted, considering divorce. The key point here is whether tattling to his mom was wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. On one hand, she's trying to protect her child and hold her partner accountable. On the other, involving his mother without his consent might overstep. But considering the child's well-being is paramount. If the father isn't helping, it's a serious issue. However, the method of addressing it could be questionable.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe she should have involved a professional or social services if things were that bad. But given the circumstances, she's desperate. The video serves as evidence, which his mom used to confront him. The boyfriend is now upset because he feels it's an invasion of privacy. But the mother-in-law's reaction did lead to him being reamed, which might be good for him to realize his faults.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the culture and what's considered acceptable. In some views, involving family is okay if it's for the child's sake. Others might say it's a breach of trust. But since the main issue is the child's welfare, her actions might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong. But need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe she should have talked to him directly again before involving mom. But he's not listening. So, given the circumstances, B makes sense.\n"
