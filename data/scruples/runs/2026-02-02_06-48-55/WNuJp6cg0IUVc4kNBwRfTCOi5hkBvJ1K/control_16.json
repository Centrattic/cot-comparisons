He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend not taking care of their daughter, and the author sending a video of him ignoring the baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend has a history of not helping with the baby, only doing so when prompted, and then the author tried to involve his mother by sending a video. The boyfriend is upset that she involved his mom and claims the video was out of context.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's at her breaking point. She's been trying to communicate with her boyfriend, but he keeps going back to old habits. She tried a last effort by leaving, but he didn't take action. The video was a way to get his mother to intervene because he wasn't responding to her. \n\nBut does that make her wrong? Well, involving family, especially the mother-in-law, can be a sensitive issue. Some people might see it as crossing a boundary, especially if they hadn't discussed involving family before. However, the author's actions were driven by the baby's well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in seeking help through his mother, especially if they had exhausted other communication methods. On the other hand, sending a video without context could be seen as deceptive, even if the intention was to show the truth. However, the user mentioned the video was about 10 seconds and she provided an explanation, so maybe the context was included.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. They've been together for five years, and it's been a problem since the baby. The author has tried to resolve it, but he hasn't followed through. That could indicate a pattern of neglect, which is a valid concern. The mother's reaction might be justified if the video was taken out of context, but the situation described seems to be a real instance of neglect.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it depends on cultural or personal values. Some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the mother, while others might say she had no choice left. But the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The author's action was a response to his inaction, so she might not be in the wrong. However, the method of involving family might be questionable. Still, given the circumstances, it's a tough spot, and the main issue is the neglect of the child.\n\nI think the answer would lean towards No (B), the author isn't in the wrong because she was trying to address a critical issue for their child's well-being, and the boyfriend's actions were the root problem. The method might be debatable, but the intent was to protect the baby and seek help when all else failed.\n"
