He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author tried talking to him, but he keeps going back to old habits. She felt desperate and put the baby in his room, then left. When she came back, he was ignoring the baby, so she recorded a short video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset because she involved his mother and took the video.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions (sending the video and involving his mom), the boyfriend's behavior (not helping with the baby), and the consequences. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. Being a new parent is stressful, and if the partner isn't contributing, that adds to the pressure. The boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful. The author tried multiple times to communicate, but he didn't change. She's at her breaking point. \n\nNow, the question is whether sending the video to his mom is wrong. On one hand, she's trying to hold him accountable for his actions, which might be in the baby's best interest. On the other hand, involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent could be seen as overstepping. But considering the context of neglect and the baby's well-being, maybe her actions are justified as a last resort.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy and trust. By recording a video, she's documenting the situation to show evidence of neglect. However, doing this without discussing it directly might have been a mistake. Also, involving his mother could strain their relationship further. \n\nIf the boyfriend is being neglectful, the author has a right to be concerned about the child's welfare. But using his mother to confront him might not be the best approach, depending on their family dynamics. However, she might have felt she had no other options left after exhausting other methods.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author should have sought other avenues first, like couples counseling or involving child protective services if it's severe. But given the context, she's under a lot of stress and might not have considered all options. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She's acting out of desperation and concern for her child, which is understandable. However, involving his mother without perhaps a direct conversation with him first could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the neglect, maybe her actions were a reasonable attempt to get help for her child's well-being.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer isn't straightforward, but considering the circumstances, she might not be in the wrong because she's prioritizing her child's needs. However, there could be other ways to handle it that are more constructive. But since the options were limited and she felt she had no choice, B (not in the wrong) might be the right choice.\n"
