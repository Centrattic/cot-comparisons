He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him neglecting their baby. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He's playing video games instead of taking care of the baby. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't change his behavior. She even tried a last-minute attempt by pretending to leave and then sending a video to his mom when he ignored the baby.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's neglect and the author's actions. Neglecting a baby is serious. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, which is causing stress on the author. She's at her breaking point and considering divorce. \n\nNow, the question is whether sending the video to his mom makes her at fault. The boyfriend argues she took it out of context. But given the context\u2014he's been neglecting the baby for months, only improving briefly when confronted\u2014it seems like the video was one example of his behavior. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to get help for her child's well-being. Involving family might be seen as overstepping, but if the situation is endangering the child, it's more about protecting the baby. However, the method could be questionable. Maybe she should have involved other authorities like a doctor or child services first? But since she's in a stressful situation and desperate, using family as leverage could be understandable.\n\nStill, tattling might strain the relationship further. But the main issue is the boyfriend's neglect. The author's actions were a reaction to ongoing problems. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not, since the root issue is his behavior. She might have handled it differently, but given the circumstances, her intent was to protect her child. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
