He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him not taking care of their baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, instead playing video games. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, and he sometimes improves but then relapses. She decides to stage a scenario where she leaves the baby in his room and takes a video when he ignores the baby's cries. She sends it to his mom, who then confronts him. He's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of involvement with their child. As a parent, he has responsibilities, and not fulfilling them is a problem. The author has tried communication, but it's not working. Her actions led to his mom getting involved, which he doesn't appreciate. \n\nOn one hand, she's doing it to hold him accountable for the baby's well-being. Parents should care for their children, and if he's not doing that, she's trying to make sure the child is safe. The video serves as evidence of his neglect. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't go through proper channels first. She didn't involve his mom before, only when she felt she couldn't handle it anymore. Staging a situation to capture proof might be seen as manipulative. Also, involving a parent (his mom) could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since he might feel it's a family matter. The act of taking a video without his consent could be considered invasive or deceptive.\n\nBut then, considering the stakes\u2014childcare and safety\u2014the author's primary concern is the baby's welfare. If he's not responding even after multiple warnings, her actions are aimed at forcing accountability. The mom's reaction suggests that her actions were necessary to wake him up.\n\nHowever, there's a line between seeking help and tattling. By going to his mom, she's involving family without his knowledge, which he might find disrespectful. The method of using a video could be out of context, as he might have had a reason that wasn't shown. Also, staging the situation (leaving him alone with the baby knowing he might neglect her) could be seen as a trap, which isn't fair.\n\nBut given that the baby's needs are critical, and he's repeatedly failing to meet them, the author's frustration is justified. The key point is whether she used the right approach. While involving the mother might not be the ideal first step, the underlying issue is serious. In some cases, external intervention is necessary when a partner is not fulfilling responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the means were appropriate. If the video was a necessary measure to protect the child, maybe not wrong. But the method of involving the mother without discussion might be in the wrong. However, considering the child's welfare, maybe she's right. But in terms of the relationship, she crossed a line. It's a tough call. I'm leaning towards her being in the right because the child's safety is paramount, but others might say she should have handled it differently. Hmm. The options are A or B. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But considering the circumstances, maybe not. So, final answer B.\n"
