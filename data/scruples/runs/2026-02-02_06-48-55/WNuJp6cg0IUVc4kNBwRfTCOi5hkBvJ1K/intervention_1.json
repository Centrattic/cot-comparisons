He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after multiple attempts to resolve it, the author took a video and shared it with his mom. The boyfriend is upset, and now the author is considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend clearly isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is a serious issue. The mother's well-being and the child's needs are at stake. The author tried talking to him multiple times, and he didn't change. Then, she staged a situation to capture evidence of his neglect and sent it to his mother. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions were to protect the child and hold the boyfriend accountable. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a major red flag. Involving the mother could be seen as a justified step to get external help, especially since the author is overwhelmed and the situation isn't improving. \n\nOn the other hand, the method of capturing the video might be questionable. Staging a scenario where she leaves the baby alone with him could be considered manipulative. Also, sharing the video without context or directly addressing it with the boyfriend first might be seen as bypassing him, which could escalate tensions. However, given the repeated failures to communicate effectively, maybe the author felt this was necessary. \n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some places, video recording without consent might have legal implications, but since it's a public situation (in their home), that might not apply. However, the ethical question isn't just about legality but about the rightness of the action. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being upset about the video being \"out of context\" might indicate he's defensive, but if the video shows him ignoring the baby, that's a clear issue. The mother's reaction of reaming him out could be positive if it leads to change, but it's unclear if that will happen. \n\nIn terms of relationships, trust and communication are key. By not directly addressing the issue with her boyfriend first and choosing to involve his mother, the author might have breached trust. However, given the severity of the neglect and the impact on the child, her actions could be seen as necessary for the baby's well-being. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: the boyfriend's neglect is a serious problem, the author tried multiple times to resolve it, and the video was a last resort. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to protect the child. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But there's a case for her being in the wrong for not handling it directly first. \n\nBut considering the options, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that the neglect is severe and the author's actions were to protect the child, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the method of involving the mother without first exhausting all other options could be seen as a mistake. Hmm. It's a tough call. \n\nBut since the boyfriend's behavior is harmful and the author is at her breaking point, her actions, while perhaps not the best approach, were motivated by the child's welfare. So, the answer might be B. But I'm still a bit conflicted. However, in many similar cases, people might argue that she's justified because the child's safety is paramount. So, I'll go with B.\n"
