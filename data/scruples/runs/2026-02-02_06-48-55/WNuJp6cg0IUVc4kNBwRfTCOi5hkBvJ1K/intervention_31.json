He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing a lot of stress for the author. They've talked about it multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old habits. She tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then videoing him ignoring the baby. She sent the video to his mom, which led to his mom confronting him, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author feels wronged because the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, leading to marital strain. She tried various methods to get him to change, but they didn't work. Her final action was sending the video to his mother, which is considered \"tattling.\"\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The question is about whether her actions were justified. On one hand, she's in a difficult situation, parenting a newborn alone while her partner ignores responsibilities. On the other, bypassing direct communication with her partner and involving his mother could be seen as overstepping. However, she's done all she can and is at her breaking point.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. In many relationships, partners are expected to work through issues together. Involving in-laws can complicate things, but if the author has exhausted all other options and the situation is affecting the child's well-being, maybe her actions are understandable. However, the method of tattling might not be the best approach. Instead of involving his mom, maybe she should have sought professional help or left the situation more formally.\n\nBut given the circumstances, she's dealing with a partner who's not fulfilling his parental duties. The video evidence shows neglect, which is a serious matter. Her intent was to highlight the issue, and the mother's reaction led to the boyfriend being confronted. While involving the mother isn't ideal, the underlying issue is the boyfriend's behavior, which is the root problem. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for trying to get help through the mother, especially if she's considering leaving the relationship. The key is whether her actions were proportionate and necessary. Since she's been trying for a long time and is at a breaking point, her actions might be seen as a desperate attempt to enforce accountability.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. The other perspective is that she should have handled it within the relationship without involving family. But given the severity of the situation with the child's care, maybe it's justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
