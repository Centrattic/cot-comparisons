He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sent a video of their boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the child care, refuses to take care of the baby unless prompted, and the author is at a breaking point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author tried multiple times to address the issue directly with their partner, which is the right approach. When communication fails, the next step might be involving others, but the method chosen here is sending a video to the mother. That's where the controversy is.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is concerning, especially since it's affecting the child's well-being. Parents have a responsibility to care for their children, and if one parent is neglecting that, it's a serious issue. The author's intention was to get support from the boyfriend's mother to address the problem, which they felt was necessary after exhausting other options.\n\nHowever, directly sending a video without discussing it with the boyfriend first could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the boyfriend's actions are wrong, the method of confrontation might have been handled differently. The mother's reaction suggests that this was unexpected, which could strain the relationship further. The boyfriend feeling that the video was taken out of context might indicate that the situation isn't as straightforward as it seems to the author.\n\nThe line between seeking support and tattling can be thin. While the author's actions were driven by concern for the child, bypassing the boyfriend and going to his mother might have been a misstep. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and this action could be seen as undermining the boyfriend's autonomy and their ability to resolve the issue themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. If he's not fulfilling his parental duties and the author has tried everything, the author might feel justified in seeking external help. However, the method of doing so without a direct confrontation first might not be the best approach. The question is whether the ends justify the means here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intentions were to protect the child and address neglect, which is valid. But the method of involving the mother without prior discussion might have been a mistake. The boyfriend's reaction could also be part of a pattern of avoiding responsibility, but the author's action might have been a last resort.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be questioned. The mother's reaction and the boyfriend's anger suggest that the method was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid. So, the answer might tip towards the author being in the wrong, but it's not clear-cut.\n"
