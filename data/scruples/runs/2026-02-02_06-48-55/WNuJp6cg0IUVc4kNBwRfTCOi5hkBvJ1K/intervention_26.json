He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom where he's ignoring the baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend isn't helping with their daughter, especially when she's crying. The couple has talked about it multiple times, but he keeps reverting to his old behavior. The author, feeling desperate, put the baby in his room, pretended to leave, went to the gas station, and when she returned, he was ignoring the baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to the mom confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset she involved his mom and claims the video was out of context.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. From a moral standpoint, the main issue here is involving the mother in a private family matter, especially by sending evidence without discussing it directly with the boyfriend first. The author might have felt justified because the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, but using the mother as a mediator in this way can be seen as undermining the relationship. Parents often expect their children to handle family issues themselves before involving the other parent's family. Additionally, recording without consent could be a privacy issue, though in an emergency or urgent matter, that might be excused. However, the method of confrontation by involving the mother might have been a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior towards their child is clearly problematic. The author is in a stressful situation with a newborn and feels unsupported. She's tried talking to him, and he hasn't made lasting changes. The act of sending the video might be a last resort to get help, but the appropriate step might have been to seek couples counseling or his father's involvement if necessary, rather than the mother. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to involve the mother? Was there a less invasive way to handle it? The answer likely depends on cultural norms and the relationship dynamics, but generally, involving in-laws in such a way without prior discussion might be seen as wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
