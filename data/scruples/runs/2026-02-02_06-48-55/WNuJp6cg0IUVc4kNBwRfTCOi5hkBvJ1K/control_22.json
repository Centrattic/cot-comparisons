He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author is really stressed. They tried talking about it, but he doesn't change much. The author then puts the baby in his gaming room and leaves for a bit, takes a video of him ignoring the baby, and sends it to his mom. The boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and says the video was out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities. The author has tried multiple times to communicate this, but he reverts to old behavior. The author is at a breaking point. She does this drastic action as a last resort to get him to change. Is it justifiable?\n\nOn one hand, involving the mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's not discussed with the boyfriend first. However, the situation is about the well-being of the baby. If the father is neglecting the child, maybe that's a valid concern. But the method of using a video could be problematic. Was the video a fair representation? The boyfriend claims it's out of context. Also, sending it to his mom without his consent could be seen as manipulating the mother to intervene, which might not be the best approach. \n\nBut considering the severity of the issue\u2014childcare and parental neglect\u2014it's a serious matter. The author might feel desperate and think that this is the only way to make the boyfriend take it seriously. However, there might be other ways to handle it, like going to counseling or legal help if necessary. Using the mother might be a form of manipulation, but it's also a way to get support from family. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong. If the boyfriend is neglecting the child, the author is trying to protect the child. But the method might be questionable. Sending a video to his mom without his knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, but the intent is to protect the baby. It's a tough call. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the issue is serious, but the approach might not be the best. However, the answer here is binary (A or B). \n\nI think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. Because the situation involves childcare neglect, and the author is trying to address a serious problem that's been ongoing and unresponsive to normal communication. The method is extreme, but the intent is to protect the child, which could be justified. However, some might argue that involving the mother without consent is wrong regardless, but given the context, maybe it's understandable. So leaning towards B.\n"
