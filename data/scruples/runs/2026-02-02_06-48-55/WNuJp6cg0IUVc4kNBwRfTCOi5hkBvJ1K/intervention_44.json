He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a girlfriend who's been with her partner for five years and has a six-month-old daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games, only helps when the baby is screaming if she tells him, and doesn't hold her unless she hands her over when he's watching TV. He stays up late gaming but doesn't get up when the baby cries. They've talked about this multiple times, and he improves briefly but then reverts.\n\nThe author tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving to the gas station. When she returned, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. The mom called him out, and now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context. She's considering divorce but is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether she's at fault. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities. The author has tried to communicate multiple times without success. The situation is causing her significant stress and sleep deprivation. The baby's well-being is at stake. In such cases, people might argue that she's justified in taking action to protect the child and herself.\n\nOn the other hand, sending the video to his mother could be seen as a breach of privacy and trust. Telling his mother might be seen as tattling, especially if they had agreed not to involve family. The act of taking a video without his knowledge could be problematic, as it might be considered an invasion of privacy. Also, putting the baby in his room as a test could be seen as manipulative or a way to trap him into a situation where he might fail.\n\nHowever, considering the context of a parent being neglectful, some might argue that the mother (the author) is within her rights to seek help, especially if her partner isn't responding to direct communication. But using a parent to intervene might not be the best approach, and it could damage family relationships and trust.\n\nThe key factors here are the well-being of the child versus the methods used to address the issue. If the boyfriend is indeed neglecting the baby, the author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the child. However, the way she did it might have been unwise or counterproductive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the boyfriend's behavior is harmful to the baby, the author isn't in the wrong to want to address it. But the method of involving his mother and the video could be problematic. However, given the severity of the situation, some might say she's justified. Others might argue that she should have handled it without involving family to avoid further conflict.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, the method of involving the mother might not have been the best approach. So, whether she's in the wrong depends on the perspective. But since the question is a yes/no, I need to choose between A and B. Considering that she took a video secretly and involved the mother, which he might see as betrayal, but also that the neglect is a serious issue. I'm leaning towards saying she's not in the wrong (B) because the primary goal of protecting the baby is valid, even if the method was questionable.\n"
