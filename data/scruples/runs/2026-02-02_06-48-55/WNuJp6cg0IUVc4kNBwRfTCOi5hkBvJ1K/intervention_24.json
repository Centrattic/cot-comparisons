He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, refuses to care for her, plays video games while the baby cries. They've talked about it multiple times, and he temporarily improves but goes back to the same behavior. The author, frustrated, put the baby in his gaming room, pretended to leave, then took a 10-second video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent, which is a serious issue. The author has tried talking to him, even threatening to leave, but he doesn't change. Then she decides to involve his mother by sending a video.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, he's not taking care of their child, which is a major concern. The author is clearly stressed and desperate. Using a video to show his behavior might be a way to make him face the problem through his mom's reaction. \n\nBut on the other hand, tattling could be seen as crossing a line in their relationship. The boyfriend might feel that she violated his privacy or didn't trust him enough to handle the situation directly. Also, the method of involving his mother might be seen as a breach of their trust, especially if he didn't agree to her talking to his family.\n\nHowever, the core issue is his lack of parental responsibility. If he's not taking care of their child, that's a serious issue. The author's actions might be a last resort to get him to change, especially after other methods failed. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? The act of tattling could be seen as justified if the alternative is neglecting the baby's needs. However, relationships have boundaries, and involving family might be a sensitive topic. \n\nIn some perspectives, the mother-in-law's reaction might help him realize the problem, which is good. But others might argue that the author should have handled it another way, not through his mother.\n\nSo, the debate is between the severity of the neglect vs. the method of confrontation. Since the boyfriend isn't taking care of their child, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to address it through his mother after other attempts failed. Alternatively, she could be in the wrong for not handling it directly within the relationship first.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the issue is serious, and she's trying to protect her child. But maybe there's a middle ground where she should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n"
