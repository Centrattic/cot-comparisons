He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe situation is about a couple who has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend (now maybe husband) isn't helping with the baby, plays video games instead, and only takes care of the baby when the author tells him to. The author tried talking about it, but he doesn't change. Then, she decides to put the baby in his gaming room, leaves to get gas, and when she comes back, he's ignoring the crying baby. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom, which leads to the mom calling him out. Now the boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and says the video is out of context. The author is considering divorce and is wondering if she's in the wrong for tattling.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of involvement with their child. The author is struggling with the baby's care and feels unsupported. She tried communication, which didn't work. Then she decides to take drastic action by staging a situation (putting the baby in his room and leaving) to capture evidence of his neglect. She shares this with his mother, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. Not helping with a crying baby, especially when the mother is already under stress, could be seen as neglectful. However, the author's method of handling it might be problematic. Staging a scenario to get evidence could be seen as manipulative or deceptive. Even though her intent might be to protect the child, the means of doing so by involving his mother without his consent might overstep. The boyfriend has a right to privacy and autonomy in his relationship, even if he's acting poorly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position with a new baby and is trying to hold her partner accountable. The boyfriend's refusal to help is a serious issue, and the author is seeking support from his mother, which is a common family dynamic. However, sharing a staged video might not be the most constructive approach. It could damage trust and relationships further, especially between the couple and the boyfriend's mother.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some cases, staging a situation could be seen as entrapment, but since it's a personal matter and not a legal case, that might not apply. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The boyfriend's mother was involved, which might be appropriate if the child's well-being is at risk, but the method of doing it could be questioned.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as justified if the child's safety is a concern. However, the tattling aspect might not be the best approach. Direct communication with the boyfriend, perhaps involving a counselor or mediator, might be more effective than involving his mother. The author's decision to involve his mother without his knowledge could be seen as going behind his back, which might be considered wrong if there's a trust issue. But if the boyfriend isn't responsive to communication, the author might feel she's out of options.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic and the author's concern is valid, the method she used to address it by staging a situation and involving his mother might be considered in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the means justified the ends. The author's intent was to protect the child, but the approach could have been more constructive. So, balancing both sides, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if her underlying concerns are valid.\n"
