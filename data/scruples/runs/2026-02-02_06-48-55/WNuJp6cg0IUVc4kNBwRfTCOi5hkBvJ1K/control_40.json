He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter. The author tried talking to him multiple times, even threatened to leave, but he keeps going back to not helping. Then she put the baby in his room, left, got a video of him ignoring the baby, and sent it to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has made multiple attempts to resolve this, but he's not improving. The video was a last resort after she couldn't trust him. She didn't actually leave; she went to the gas station, which might be a point against her because she didn't follow through on her threat. But her main goal was to get her mother-in-law to intervene.\n\nIs tattling considered wrong here? It's a judgment call. On one hand, involving family can be seen as meddling, especially if there's a lack of communication. But in this case, the author was desperate and had tried everything else. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a major red flag. The video serves as evidence of his neglect.\n\nThe key points are: he's not helping with the baby, she's exhausted, she tried to address it directly, and the video was to get support. The mother's reaction might be harsh, but the boyfriend's actions are the root problem. The author's action could be seen as necessary to protect the child, even if she didn't handle it perfectly. However, she could have communicated better with her boyfriend first instead of involving his mother. But given his lack of responsiveness, maybe it was justified.\n\nSo, the answer is B, meaning she's not in the wrong. Her actions, while maybe not the best approach, were driven by necessity and the well-being of the child. The boyfriend's behavior is the real issue here.\n"
