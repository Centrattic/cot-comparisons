He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they have a 6-month-old daughter. Since the baby's birth, her boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, only helps when the baby is screaming if she tells him to, and even then, questions why she can't do it. He only holds the baby when she's calm and he's watching TV. He stays up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby cries. They've talked multiple times, and he improves for a week then goes back. She's considering divorce. She tried a last effort by putting the baby in his gaming room and leaving, then going to the gas station. When she came back, the baby was screaming and he ignored her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, explaining the situation. His mom called him and reamed him, then he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong for tattling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boyfriend's behavior. He's not helping with his own child, which is a serious issue. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, and he hasn't changed. The situation is affecting her mental health and the baby's well-being. She's at her breaking point.\n\nShe put the baby in his room and left to see if he would help. When she came back, the baby was crying and he ignored it. She documented this, which is a way to show evidence. Then she sent the video to his mom. The boyfriend is upset she involved his mother and claims the video is out of context. The mother called him and reamed him. Now, the author is being blamed for tattling.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's trying to get her partner to take responsibility. Sending the video to his mom might be a breach of trust, but her intention was to get her partner to help with their child. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, so the author's action could be seen as a last resort to protect the child. However, involving family might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, is she wrong?\n\nOn one hand, she's trying to protect the baby. On the other, she went behind her partner's back and involved his mom. The boyfriend might feel her action was untrusting. But the boyfriend's actions are worse. Maybe the author's action is justified because the child's well-being is at stake. Alternatively, she should have tried other methods first, but she's already tried talking multiple times. The video is a factual record of the neglect. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
