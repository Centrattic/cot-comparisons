He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sent a video to her boyfriend's mother is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The girlfriend tried multiple times to address the issue, even going so far as to stage a situation where she left the baby in his care while she went to the gas station. She recorded a 10-second video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mother, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend's behavior is a major issue\u2014he's not fulfilling his parental duties, which is causing the author significant stress. They've had multiple discussions about this, but he keeps reverting to old habits. The author's actions were a last attempt to make him take responsibility, using her mother-in-law as leverage. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The possible angles are: Did she cross a boundary by involving the mother? Was there a better way to handle it? The mother-in-law's reaction and the boyfriend's feeling that the video was taken out of context are also factors.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. On one hand, involving family can be seen as overstepping, especially if the couple hasn't resolved the issue directly. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014parental neglect and the well-being of a child\u2014it's understandable that she felt desperate. The author tried multiple approaches, and this might have been a last resort. \n\nIn many cases, couples are encouraged to handle their issues without involving parents, but when it comes to the safety and well-being of a child, the lines can blur. The act of recording a video could be seen as manipulative, but it also serves as evidence of the ongoing neglect. The mother contacting the son might lead to accountability, but it could also create more tension between the couples.\n\nI think the key here is the context of the situation. The author was at her wit's end, and the neglect of the child is a serious matter. While involving the mother might not be ideal, her intention was to protect the child and get help. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because the circumstances are extreme. However, there's also the argument that she should have tried other avenues first or addressed it within the couple before involving family. But given that she tried repeatedly and he wasn't changing, her actions might be justified.\n"
