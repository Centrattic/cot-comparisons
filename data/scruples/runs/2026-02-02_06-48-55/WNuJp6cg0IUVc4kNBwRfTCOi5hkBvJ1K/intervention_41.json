He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend not caring for their baby to his mother. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games instead, only helps when the author tells him, and then even questions why she can't do it herself. The author tried confronting him, but he only improves briefly. In a moment of desperation, she left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she returned, she found the baby crying and he was ignoring her. She took a video, sent it to his mom, and his mom reamed him out. Now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context. She's considering divorce but is asking if she's at fault.\n\nI need to assess whether her actions were justified. The key points here are the boyfriend's neglect, the author's efforts to resolve the issue (talking multiple times), and her final action of involving his mother. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, ensuring the child's well-being is crucial. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author tried communication but it didn't work. When she felt the situation was dire enough that she couldn't trust him, she took a drastic step. However, involving his mother without consulting him might be seen as violating trust, even if her intention was to protect the child. \n\nBut maybe she's in the right because the child's safety and care are paramount. Alternatively, she might be wrong for not trying other avenues first or for not discussing with him before involving his family. The line between protecting the child and breaching privacy or trust is thin here. \n\nIn some perspectives, using a video to evidence neglect could be necessary for the child's welfare. However, the method of involving his mother without his knowledge might be seen as underhanded. But if the boyfriend wasn't responsive to any other methods, maybe this was a justified action to force him to take responsibility. \n\nThe question is whether the means (sending the video to the mother) were appropriate. If the author's intention was to protect the child, and the father's actions were genuinely neglectful, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the video was a setup (putting the baby in his room knowing he wouldn't help), it could be seen as manipulating evidence. However, the situation seems real\u2014she left to get gas, returned to find the baby crying and him ignoring. So the video was a real instance of neglect. \n\nIn some cases, involving family might be the only way to get help, especially if the parent is not responsive. But in a relationship, going to the other parent's mother might be crossing a boundary. However, the well-being of the child might override that. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author's actions were driven by desperation and the need to protect the child. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to address neglect. So perhaps she's not in the wrong. But others might argue that she should have handled it differently, like involving child services or seeking legal help instead of her partner's mother. \n\nBut given the context, and that the mother-in-law did intervene and reamed him out, maybe the action was necessary. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because her priority was the child's welfare, even if the method was problematic.\n"
