He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother by sending a video of him ignoring their baby. The situation is that their relationship has been deteriorating since the daughter was born six months ago. The boyfriend doesn't help with childcare, prefers to play video games, and only engages with the baby when the author is there. They've discussed it multiple times, but he doesn't change consistently.\n\nThe author tried a last effort by leaving the baby with him and going to the gas station, then sent a video to his mom when he ignored the baby. The mother called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethics here. The author is concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. Sending a video to the mother might be seen as a breach of trust, but it's also an attempt to get support for the child's care. \n\nIn some contexts, involving family, especially parents, can be necessary when there's a concern about a child's safety. However, the method might be questionable. The author didn't ask for the mother's help directly but instead sent the video without context, which the boyfriend claims was taken out of context. The video was only 10 seconds, which might not show the whole picture. \n\nBut the core issue is the boyfriend's behavior. If he's consistently neglecting the baby, the author has a right to be concerned. The act of sending the video was to highlight the neglect, even if it was a short clip. It's a tough situation where the author is under stress and seeking help. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as overstepping by using this tactic. The boyfriend might feel that the mother's involvement is an intrusion, especially if the couple had not resolved the issue among themselves first. However, the author mentions they tried talking multiple times without success. \n\nI think the key here is the child's well-being. The author's action was driven by a concern for their daughter's needs, which is a justifiable reason. While the method could have been better, like involving the mother-in-law with more context or seeking professional help, the intent was to address neglect. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
