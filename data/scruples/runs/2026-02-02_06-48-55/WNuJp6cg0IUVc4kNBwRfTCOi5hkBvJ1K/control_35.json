He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with the baby, leading to the author taking this action as a last resort.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties. The author tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he relapses into bad behavior. She felt she couldn't trust him, so she staged a scenario to catch him in the act. Taking a video and sending it to his mother seems like a desperate move to get him to change, but she's now blamed for tattling.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's consistent neglect and the author's attempts to resolve it before involving his mother. While it's not ideal to involve a parent, the context shows the author was at her breaking point. The boyfriend's actions are the root problem\u2014refusing to care for the baby despite discussions. The mother's reaction might be to defend her son, but the father's behavior is concerning. The author's action was a last-ditch effort to make him take responsibility. So, she's not in the wrong because the responsibility for the baby's care is shared, and she's trying to ensure the child's well-being. The boyfriend's failure to support the child is the main issue here.\n"
