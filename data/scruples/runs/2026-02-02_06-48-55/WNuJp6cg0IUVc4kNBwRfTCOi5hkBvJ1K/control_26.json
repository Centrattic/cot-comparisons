He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a newborn baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author, the mother, tried to get him to help but he wouldn't, so she took a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context. She's considering divorce but is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The boyfriend is refusing to care for the baby, only helps when told, and isn't consistent. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he relapses into old habits. In her frustration, she put the baby in his room, left to get gas, and when she came back, he was ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom to get her to intervene. Now he's angry, and she's wondering if she's wrong for doing that.\n\nThe question is whether her actions were justified. Let's think about the ethical aspects here. The baby's well-being is a primary concern. If the father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, there's a valid concern about the child's care. The mother is overwhelmed and trying to get help. However, the method she used involved tattling on her partner to his mother, which could be seen as overstepping if it wasn't the best approach to resolve the issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The mother tried talking to him multiple times, which is good. But when communication failed, she escalated to involving his mother. While the mother's intent was to get help for her child and herself, the method might be problematic. In some cultures, involving in-laws can be a sensitive issue, and it might not be the best way to handle a marital problem. However, in this case, the well-being of the child is at stake, which adds a layer of urgency.\n\nAnother angle is the video. Taking a 10-second video in that situation could be seen as capturing a moment that might be misleading if not all the context is shared. The boyfriend accused her of taking it out of context, which might mean there's more to the story. However, if the video clearly shows him ignoring the baby, then maybe the context is sufficient. Still, using a video to evidence someone's neglect is a strong action and could be seen as confrontational.\n\nThe mother is at her breaking point, which is understandable. She's dealing with the stress of a newborn and an uncooperative partner. Her actions are driven by desperation to get help, both for herself and the baby. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. \n\nNow, considering legal or ethical standards, in some places, there are laws about parental neglect. If the father isn't providing adequate care, she might have grounds for legal action beyond just involving his mother. But the question here is more about moral responsibility rather than legal.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, escalating to in-laws can sometimes cause more tension. However, if the mother's own family isn't involved, the paternal side might be the only other support. His mother's reaction was to confront him, which did lead to some change, but he's still upset with the author for her actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, she acted out of necessity to protect her child and herself. On the other hand, involving his mother without perhaps exhausting all other options could be seen as a misstep. However, she did try multiple times to resolve the issue directly with him, and he didn't change. Her actions could be justified as a last resort to ensure the baby's well-being. The video might be a bit of an overreaction, but given the circumstances, it's a way to capture evidence that he doesn't want to help. \n\nThe key here is the baby's safety and the mother's mental health. If the father is neglecting the child, then the mother's actions to intervene are understandable. However, the method of intervention (telling his mother) is where the conflict arises. But considering the severity of the issue, the mother's actions might be justified despite the method. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
