He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend isn't helping much with the baby. The author, as the mother, is clearly frustrated because he's not stepping up. She's tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old habits. \n\nIn her last attempt, she put the baby in his gaming room and when she left, she recorded a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom. Now she's getting backlash for that. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. Not helping with a newborn is a big issue, especially when the partner is overwhelmed. The author has a valid reason to be upset. But the method she used\u2014telling his mom and sending a video\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nTelling a parent about a child's spouse's issues isn't usually something couples handle privately. It might come off as tattling, which is what the title suggests. Also, recording a video without his knowledge might be a privacy issue. Even if her intentions are good, the act of involving his mother and using a video could be seen as manipulative or aggressive. \n\nOn the other hand, she's dealing with extreme stress from parenting alone and feeling unsupported. Her actions might be a last resort to get help, but maybe there were other ways to handle it, like couples counseling or a mediator. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend is definitely at fault for not helping, the author's choice to involve his mom without discussing it with him first might be considered wrong. The line between seeking help and violating trust can be thin here. So, maybe the answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points.\n"
