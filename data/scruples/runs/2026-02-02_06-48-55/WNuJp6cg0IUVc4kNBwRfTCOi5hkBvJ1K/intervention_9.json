He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author's boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. He's been sitting on the couch playing games and only helps when the baby is screaming and the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, but he improves briefly then goes back. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and went to the gas station, then took a video when the baby cried and he ignored her. She sent it to his mom with an explanation, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has tried communication, which is important. When direct communication fails, what options are left? The author's action is to involve the boyfriend's mother, which can be seen as tattling. However, the context is a newborn, and the father isn't helping, leading to the mother being overwhelmed.\n\nIs tattling on a partner to their parent ever okay? It's a gray area. On one hand, it's interfering in their family dynamics. On the other, the author might feel desperate. The act of involving the mother might have been a way to hold the boyfriend accountable, especially since previous methods didn't work. However, the method might be seen as bypassing the boyfriend's responsibility to address the issue between themselves.\n\nThe author also took a video, which could be seen as trying to capture evidence, but the boyfriend argues it's out of context. The video might not show the full picture, which could be a problem. The author's intention was to make the boyfriend's mother aware, hoping she would pressure him to change. Whether that's right depends on whether the ends justify the means.\n\nConsidering the severity of the situation\u2014parental neglect of a newborn\u2014it's a significant stressor. The author's actions might stem from feeling unable to handle the situation alone. However, involving the mother could be seen as undermining the boyfriend's autonomy. The boyfriend's anger is understandable because he might feel betrayed. The author's decision to send the video might have been a last resort, but it's a contentious method.\n\nEthically, it's important to consider boundaries. Couples should resolve issues themselves unless there's a risk to the child. Here, the baby is being neglected, which is a red flag. The author might have crossed a line by involving the mother, but the underlying issue is the boyfriend's lack of parental responsibility. The key is whether the action was necessary. If the author felt it was the only way to get help, maybe she's justified. But some might argue she should have sought other resources first, like counseling or involving child services if the neglect is severe enough.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often weighs the intention and the impact. The author's intention was to protect the baby and get help, which is understandable. However, the method of using the mother as a mediator isn't the typical approach. The boyfriend's reaction might be harsh, but the author is in a stressful situation. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. The action is understandable given the circumstances, but the method might be seen as inappropriate. However, considering the child's well-being, some might say she's justified. The answer could lean either way, but based on typical AITA responses, they might side with the author being not in the wrong because the situation is serious. But others might say she should have handled it differently. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
