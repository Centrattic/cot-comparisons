He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent the video to the boyfriend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a struggling marriage with a new baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author tried to get help by sending a video to his mother, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend's lack of involvement is causing significant stress on the mother. The author tried multiple times to address it directly, but with no lasting improvement. Then, they staged a situation to document the neglect, sent the video to the mother, which led to the boyfriend being reprimanded. Now, the boyfriend is upset about the video and the mother-in-law's involvement.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intention was to ensure the baby's well-being. However, using a staged scenario and involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent might be seen as manipulative. The key points here are consent and the method used. The author didn't trust the boyfriend, which is understandable, but the approach of tricking the boyfriend into a situation and then involving his mother without discussing it with him first could be problematic. It might be seen as a breach of trust and privacy between the couple. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly neglectful, and the author is in a vulnerable position as a new mother. The question is whether the ends justify the means. While the mother-in-law's reaction was harsh, the author's actions were a last resort after exhausting other options. However, involving family without the partner's consent can strain relationships further and might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were driven by desperation and a need to protect the baby, but the method used could be seen as underhanded. It's possible that the author is in the right in wanting the baby to be cared for, but the way they handled it might be considered wrong because it involved deceit and third-party intervention without prior discussion with the boyfriend. However, given the circumstances of neglect, some might argue that the author had no good options left.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the answer might be B (No), as the author's intentions were to ensure the baby's well-being, even if the method was questionable. But there's a case for A (Yes) as well because of the deceit involved. However, given the severity of the neglect and the author's efforts to resolve it, B seems more accurate.\n"
