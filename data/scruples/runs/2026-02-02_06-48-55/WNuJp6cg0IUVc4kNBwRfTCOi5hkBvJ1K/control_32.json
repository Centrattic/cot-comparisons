He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a relationship where the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author sent a video to his mom. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend has been neglecting his responsibilities as a parent. The user mentions that he plays video games, refuses to care for the baby unless told, and only interacts when the baby is calm. They've had multiple discussions, but he reverts to old habits. This seems like a serious issue because taking care of a newborn is a big responsibility and both parents should share it.\n\nThe user tried to leave to get gas, but upon returning, the baby was crying and he wasn't attending to her. She took a video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him out, and he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's trying to protect the baby and address the neglect. She's at her breaking point and has already considered divorce. On the other hand, involving his mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if they hadn't resolved the issue between themselves first. However, the father's behavior could be endangering the child, so maybe she had a duty to act. \n\nLegally, child neglect is a serious matter. If the father is consistently neglecting the baby, the mother might be justified in seeking help, even from family. But in terms of their relationship, she might have crossed a line by going to his mom instead of handling it directly. However, given the severity of the situation, her actions could be seen as necessary to protect the child. \n\nThe key factors here are the well-being of the child, the failure of the boyfriend to take responsibility, and the mother's attempts to get him to change. Since the boyfriend isn't responding to communication, she might have felt compelled to escalate the issue. The video itself was a short clip to show the neglect, which is a factual event. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might not be in the wrong because the child's safety is the priority. Even though she went to his mother, it was to address a serious problem that wasn't being handled. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
