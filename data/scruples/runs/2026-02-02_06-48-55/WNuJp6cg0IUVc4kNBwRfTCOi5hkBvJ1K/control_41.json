He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games, only helps when told, and then argues about it. The author tried talking to him, but he keeps reverting. She even put the baby in his room to test him, then videoed him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is a parent, and the other parent isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. She's exhausted and tried multiple times to address it. The video is proof of his neglect. But she sent it to his mother without consulting him. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, the baby's well-being is crucial. A parent not helping with a newborn is a serious issue. The video serves as evidence. Getting the mother-in-law involved might be a way to hold him accountable. But on the other hand, sharing a video without consent could be seen as violating privacy. Also, involving his mother might have bypassed direct communication between the couple.\n\nHowever, in a situation where the father is consistently neglecting responsibilities, especially towards their child, the mother (the author) is in a tough spot. She's trying to protect the child and possibly get help. The act of tattling might be a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. The video, though brief, captures a specific instance of neglect. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction about the video being out of context\u2014if the author provided the explanation, maybe the problem isn't the video itself but the method of communication. But given the circumstances, the mother might have been the right person to involve to make him aware of the severity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the welfare of the child is paramount, and the author has made multiple attempts to resolve it directly, sending the evidence to his mother might be justified. The boyfriend's behavior is the core issue here. The author is trying to protect her child and herself. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and communication. She went around him instead of trying to talk again. However, if all previous communication failed, and she felt she couldn't trust him to take action, then maybe her actions were necessary. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
