He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a woman in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. They have a 6-month-old daughter. The problem is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, just plays games, and only takes care of the baby when the author tells him to. The author is really stressed, has talked to him multiple times, and even threatened to leave. Then she decides to put the baby in his room to test him, takes a video of him ignoring the baby, and sends it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's behavior. Not helping with a newborn is a big deal. New parents need support, especially with a baby who cries a lot. The boyfriend's actions (ignoring the baby, gaming, not helping) could be neglectful. The author is trying to make him take responsibility, which is understandable. She's exhausted, trying to handle everything alone.\n\nThen she stages a situation to test him. She leaves the baby with him and goes to the gas station. When she comes back, he's ignoring the baby again. She records a 10-second video and sends it to his mom. The key here is whether her actions were justified. She might have felt desperate and needed to get his attention, but involving the mother might be seen as overstepping. Some might say she should have handled it without involving the mother, while others might argue that the mother could help intervene.\n\nThe mother's reaction is to \"ream\" him, which means she's very upset. The boyfriend is now upset with the author for involving his mom. The question is whether she was wrong to do that. \n\nOn one hand, she's trying to protect her child and get help. On the other, she might have broken trust by involving his family without discussing it with him first. However, if he's not responding to her requests, maybe she had limited options. Also, the video serves as evidence of his neglect, which could be important for her case if she decides to leave or take legal action.\n\nBut in terms of the relationship, she might have crossed a line by not discussing with him first. But considering the stress and the importance of the child's well-being, maybe it's understandable. So, the answer depends on whether the act of tattling was necessary given the circumstances. If she had tried all other options and he still wasn't improving, maybe it's not her fault. Alternatively, if she could have handled it differently, maybe she's at fault. But given that he's not changing, perhaps her actions were justified.\n"
