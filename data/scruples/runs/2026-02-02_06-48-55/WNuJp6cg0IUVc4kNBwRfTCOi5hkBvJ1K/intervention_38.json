He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. The author, after many attempts to address the issue, stages a situation to get evidence of her partner's neglect and sends a video to his mother. The boyfriend is upset, and the author is considering divorce but feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, leading to significant stress for the author. She tried talking to him repeatedly without success. The final action was putting the baby in his room and leaving to get a gas station, then sending a video to his mother. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for involving his mother with the video.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly frustrated and has tried to communicate the problem. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. However, the method she used\u2014staging the situation and involving his mother\u2014might be problematic. Tattling could be seen as underhanded, but the alternative is enduring ongoing neglect. \n\nPossible angles: Is the author justified in using a deceptive tactic to get proof? Is involving his mother an appropriate step? The boyfriend's reaction is important too\u2014he feels she took the video out of context. However, from her perspective, it was to show his neglect. \n\nLegally and ethically, parental neglect is a serious matter. If the situation were worse, authorities would need to be involved. But here, it's a family matter. The author's action might be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options. However, the method of involving the mother without the father's consent could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's behavior is inexcusable. He's not helping with the baby, which is a core responsibility post-birth. The author is in a tough spot, trying to protect her child's well-being. The video might have been a necessary step to make him face the consequences. \n\nBut the act of staging the situation could be considered deceptive. The boyfriend might argue that the scenario wasn't natural. However, the author's intent was to document his neglect when she's not around. \n\nI need to balance the boyfriend's neglect against the author's actions. While her methods might be questionable, the underlying issue is serious. The mother's involvement might be the right call to pressure him to change. But in terms of right and wrong, the act of \"tattling\" is a key point. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards her being right because the neglect is significant. \n\nSo, answer B (the author is not in the wrong) seems appropriate because the neglect is severe and she's trying to address it after multiple failed attempts. Her actions, while perhaps underhanded, are in the best interest of the child.\n"
