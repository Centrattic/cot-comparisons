He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has a 6-month-old, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He's playing video games, ignoring the baby's cries unless told. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he only improves temporarily. She even staged a situation where she left to get gas and found him ignoring the baby again. She recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, which led to him being scolded by his mother and now he's upset with her for involving her mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's break it down. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue, especially regarding a child. The author has tried to address it directly without success. Using a gas station trip as a test could be seen as a desperate measure, but maybe she felt it was necessary. Recording the video is a form of evidence, but sharing it with his mother might be overstepping, depending on cultural norms and the relationship between the individuals.\n\nIs the author wrong for tattling? Well, she's trying to protect her child and hold the father accountable. However, involving the mother might not be the best approach, especially if it's causing family conflict. The boyfriend's reaction is that the video was out of context, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. But if the video clearly shows him ignoring the baby when he should be tending to her, then the video is legitimate evidence.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a tough spot, dealing with a partner who's not fulfilling his parental duties, leading to her exhaustion and considering divorce. On the other hand, she took a step that could be seen as invasive or manipulative by involving his mother and using a test scenario. Depending on the perspective, some might say she should've handled it differently, like seeking counseling or legal advice instead of involving the mother. Others might support her actions as a last resort to protect the child.\n\nLegal aspects could also play a role. If the neglect is severe, it's a matter of child welfare, and she might have a duty to report it. But since she went to the mother instead of authorities, that's a different approach. However, the question is about moral wrong, not legal. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, maybe she should've communicated better or given him more chances. But after multiple attempts and the situation not improving, her actions might be seen as justified. The key factors are the well-being of the child versus the family conflict caused by her actions. \n\nIn conclusion, while her method might be questionable, her intent to protect the child is understandable. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether the means justify the ends. The answer might be B (No), as the neglect is serious, and her actions were a response to a critical issue, even if the approach was flawed.\n"
