He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom, and her boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games a lot and only helps if she tells him to, and even then, he's not consistent. They've talked about it multiple times, and he seems to improve briefly but then goes back to his old behavior. \n\nShe tried leaving the house with the baby in his room to see if he'd help, but when she came back, he was ignoring the baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset because she involved his mom and said the video was out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's been dealing with this for months, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up. She's exhausted and considering divorce. Her action was to take a video as evidence and send it to his mom. The key points here are: Did she have a right to involve the mother? Was the video a fair representation of the situation?\n\nOn one hand, involving a parent can be seen as meddling, but in this case, the mother might be able to influence the boyfriend. Also, the boyfriend's behavior is neglecting the child, which is a serious matter. The mother's reaction was to ream him, which might have helped. However, the author could have tried other avenues first, like counseling or legal steps. But given the circumstances, she might feel desperate.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that the video is out of context. If the video was only 10 seconds, maybe it doesn't show the full story. But the author's explanation probably provided context. Still, taking a video might be seen as surveillance, which could be an invasion of privacy. But the baby's well-being is at stake here.\n\nThe core issue is whether the means she used were justified. She was trying to get help for the baby and herself. While it's not ideal to involve the mother, the boyfriend's neglect is significant. Divorce is on the table, so maybe the author feels this is a last resort. However, sending the video without considering the relationship's boundaries could be seen as overstepping. But given the child's safety, her actions might be understandable.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the boyfriend was neglecting the child, then her actions were to protect the baby. But she might have handled it differently. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the child's welfare is the priority, and she's in a dire situation. However, some might argue that she shouldn't have gone to his mom without trying other methods first. But given the information, I think the answer is B.\n"
