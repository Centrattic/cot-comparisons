He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and she tattled on him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together five years, had a baby six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only when the woman tells him to. He plays games late, ignores the baby's crying. They've talked about it multiple times, but he relapses into old habits.\n\nThe woman tried a tactic: left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she returned, he was ignoring the baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. The mom called him out, now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context. She's considering divorce but wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend's neglect, the woman's attempts to resolve it, the use of the video as evidence, and the fallout. \n\nTo determine if she's in the wrong, I need to consider ethical and relational aspects. Is tattling on him to his mom a justified action? In many relationships, involving family can be seen as a last resort. The woman's actions were to get the mom's help to address her son's behavior. However, some might argue that she should have tried other methods first or handled it within the couple without involving family.\n\nBut given the severity of the situation\u2014neglect of a child\u2014sending evidence to the mother could be seen as a necessary step to ensure the child's well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning; he's not fulfilling parental duties, and the mother might have a responsibility to address her son's actions. \n\nHowever, the method of sending a video could be problematic. If it was taken without consent and used in a way that's not accurate, the boyfriend might feel it's an invasion of privacy. The woman argues it was to show the neglect, but if the video is out of context, that could be an issue. \n\nBut considering the stakes\u2014childcare and the mother's potential role in supporting her son\u2014it's a tough call. The woman's actions were likely motivated by desperation and concern for the baby. The boyfriend's refusal to help is a significant problem. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's possible she's not in the wrong because the issue is serious, and she tried multiple times to resolve it without success. Involving the mother might be a reasonable step to get the necessary support. However, some might say that couples should handle such matters without involving parents, especially if it leads to conflict. \n\nThe key factors are the neglect of the child and the woman's attempts to address it. If the mother's intervention was effective, maybe the woman isn't at fault. But if the video was misleading, that could be a problem. The story says it's a 10-second video showing the neglect, so if it accurately depicts the situation, then it's justified. \n\nOverall, considering the boyfriend's persistent neglect and her attempts to resolve it, the woman's actions seem justified. She's acting in the best interest of the child, and the mother's involvement might be necessary to hold the father accountable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
