He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their daughter, and the author tried various methods to get him to help, but nothing worked. She then staged a scenario where she told him she was leaving, went to the gas station, and came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom. The boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the problem. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of involvement in childcare. The author has tried to communicate and address it multiple times, but he hasn't changed. The author is at her breaking point and is considering divorce. \n\nNext, the action of sending the video to the mother. In many cultures, involving family, especially a parent, can be seen as crossing a line. But the key here is the intent. The author's intention was to get her boyfriend to take responsibility, which is understandable. However, the method involved deception (pretending to leave and using a hidden camera) and then sharing the evidence with his mother, which could be considered an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that the video was taken out of context, but the author did it to document his behavior. So there's a conflict between the author's need to enforce accountability and the boyfriend's right to privacy and autonomy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, she's in a stressful situation and trying to protect her child. On the other, using a video without consent might be a breach of privacy. The act of involving the mother could be seen as a manipulation tactic, which some might view as wrong. However, if the boyfriend was neglecting the child, then the author has a strong case for wanting to ensure the child's well-being.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. Some might say that while the situation is problematic, the author's method was extreme. Others might argue that she's justified in her actions given the neglect. The key factors are the boyfriend's neglect, the author's attempts to resolve it, and the method used to escalate the issue. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the core issue is the neglect of their child. The video was a way to show the mother the reality of the situation, and the author was at her wits end. However, the method could be debated. But given the context of a child's well-being, the author's actions might be seen as justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
