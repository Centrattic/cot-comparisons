He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent the video to the boyfriend's mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author tried talking, then staged a situation to get evidence, sent a video to the mother, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic. Not helping with a newborn is a big deal, especially causing stress on the mother. But the author's actions: staging the scenario by leaving the baby in the gaming room and then taking a video. Even though the intent was to show the boyfriend's neglect, manipulating a situation to get evidence might be crossing a line. \n\nThe mother's reaction was to call her son and ream him out, which could be harsh. The boyfriend is now upset about being tattled on. The key here is whether the means justified the ends. The author's intention was to confront the problem, but using a staged situation and involving the mother without talking directly to the boyfriend first might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, considering the boyfriend has been unresponsive to previous discussions and the author feels desperate, maybe the author felt cornered. Still, taking a video secretly and sending it to the mother could be seen as an invasion of privacy or an underhanded move. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, and the mother's involvement complicates family dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's neglect is a serious issue. The author had tried multiple times to address it without success. The act of sending the video was a last attempt to make him realize the problem. But ethically, the method used could be questionable. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points. However, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by desperation and the need to protect the child, might not be the right approach. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because of the staged situation and involving the mother, but there's understanding of the context. Alternatively, if the neglect is severe, the author's actions could be justified. But generally, manipulating a scenario to get evidence is a problem, hence A.\n"
