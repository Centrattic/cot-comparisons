He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. The author, as the partner, has tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. She feels overwhelmed and even considers divorce. In a moment of desperation, she stages a situation where she leaves the baby in his care, then goes out and comes back to find him ignoring the baby. She takes a short video and sends it to his mother, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her actions were justified or not. Let's break it down. First, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014refusing to care for their child, which is a serious issue. The author has tried to address it directly, but he's not making lasting changes. She's at her breaking point. \n\nNow, the act of staging the situation: putting the baby in his room and pretending to leave. That part is a bit iffy. While the intention was to prove a point, manipulating the situation could be seen as deceptive. However, considering the context of parental responsibilities and the well-being of the child, maybe it's understandable. People in highly stressed situations might do things they wouldn't normally do to get help.\n\nThen there's the video and informing his mother. Sending the video to his mother might be crossing a boundary, as it's a private family matter. But again, the mother-in-law did intervene, which resulted in the boyfriend being reamed out. The author might feel that involving his mother was a last resort. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions are neglectful, and the mother's intervention might have been necessary to make him take responsibility. But using a staged scenario and involving family could be seen as manipulative. However, given the severity of the issue\u2014child neglect\u2014some might argue that the ends justify the means. \n\nAlso, the author is a parent herself, dealing with the stress of a new baby and a partner who isn't helping. The emotional toll is high, and her actions, while not ideal, stem from a place of desperation and concern for the child's well-being. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, staging the situation and involving the mother might be seen as crossing lines. On the other, the neglect is serious and needs to be addressed. In such cases, people's perspectives might differ. If the answer is based on strict boundaries and privacy, maybe she's in the wrong. But if considering the child's welfare and the lack of other options, she's not. \n\nThe community in AITA threads often considers intent and circumstances. Since the mother's reaction led to the boyfriend being confronted, maybe the author's actions were justified to get help. However, the deception in staging the scenario could weigh against her. Still, given the high stakes, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
