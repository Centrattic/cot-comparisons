He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend and girlfriend have a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, preferring to play video games. The author has tried talking to him, but he doesn't change for long. She's considering divorce. In a last attempt, she left to the gas station, left the baby with him, and when he ignored her crying, she took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the baby's well-being is a top priority. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The mother is trying to protect the child and get help from the boyfriend's mother. On the other hand, involving the mother-in-law can be a sensitive matter. Direct communication between the couple is usually expected first. Also, sending a video might be seen as using evidence to pressure his mom to intervene, which could be seen as manipulating the situation. \n\nThe author's actions were to gather proof and show the mother-in-law the neglect. But by doing so, she's bypassed her partner and gone to his mother. This might be seen as undermining the relationship. However, the alternative is the child being neglected. \n\nI think the key points are: The author's intent was to protect the child, but the method involved tattling, which is often considered a negative action in relationships. The boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's approach might not be the healthiest. However, in a situation where the child's needs aren't being met, it's hard to say she's entirely wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of informing the mother-in-law without her partner's knowledge could be seen as ethically questionable, even if the concern is valid. The correct approach would usually be to address the issue directly, perhaps seek counseling, but if that's failed, maybe involving family is a last resort. \n\nIn some perspectives, it's understandable as self-preservation and child protection. In others, it's about respecting boundaries and handling it within the couple. So, depending on the context, the answer might be either A or B. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the child's safety and well-being are at stake, and she's taking action to address it when other methods have failed. However, the method of involving the mother-in-law is a point of contention. But given the severity of the situation, her actions might be justified. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, in some cultures or viewpoints, going to the mother-in-law is seen as wrong regardless. \n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The key is whether the means justify the ends. If the ends are protecting the child, maybe the means are acceptable. So, the answer is B.\n"
