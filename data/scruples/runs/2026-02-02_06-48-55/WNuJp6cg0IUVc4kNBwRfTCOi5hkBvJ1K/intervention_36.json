He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who sent the video to the boyfriend's mom) is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old baby. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only when prompted, and even then he's not fully cooperative. The author tried multiple times to talk about it, even considering divorce. Then she staged a scenario to record him ignoring the baby and sent the video to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning\u2014neglecting childcare responsibilities, which is important for the baby's well-being. The author's actions were to involve the mother-in-law to get him to change. But is that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author is clearly struggling and feels desperate. They tried communication and it didn't work. Maybe they felt like they had no other options. But on the other hand, involving the mother might not be the best approach. It could be seen as manipulative or undermining the boyfriend's autonomy. Also, using a staged scenario to elicit a response might not be fair. The video could be taken out of context, as the boyfriend claims. \n\nIs there a right way to handle this? Maybe the author should have sought counseling or mediation instead of involving the mother. But the boyfriend hasn't changed despite prior efforts. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, the method used might be questionable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The author's intent was to address neglect, but the method could be seen as deceitful. The key factors are the intent vs. the action. If the author is in the wrong, it's because they bypassed direct communication and used a potentially manipulative tactic. If not, it's because the boyfriend's neglect is unacceptable and the author is trying to protect the child.\n\nI think the answer would depend on cultural or family norms too. In some contexts, involving family might be acceptable. But generally, without prior discussion, it's a no-go. The author might not be entirely in the wrong given the circumstances, but their approach could be criticized. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. \n\nGiven that the author tried multiple times to address the issue and the boyfriend didn't change, maybe the author's actions, while unorthodox, were justified. But the method of using a staged video and involving the mother might still be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the deceptive tactics used, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the valid concerns about the child's welfare. The user's own opinion was A, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is the neglect of the child, which is serious. While the method could be debated, the intent was to address a critical problem. However, others might say the approach was wrong regardless. It's a tricky balance between the severity of the issue and the method used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate directly, instead using a covert tactic. But given the boyfriend's consistent behavior, maybe they had no choice. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a serious problem. Since the neglect is ongoing and harmful, the author's intent was to protect the child. The method might be flawed, but the intent is understandable. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, but the question is about being in the wrong. If they're in the wrong, it's because they broke trust by involving the mother. If not, because they were protecting the child. \n\nGiven that, I think B is the better answer, but it's a close call. The answer is B.\n"
