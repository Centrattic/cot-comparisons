He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author felt desperate. She staged a situation to catch him, took a video, and sent it to his mom. The boyfriend's mom confronted him, and now he's upset with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together five years, and after the baby, the boyfriend isn't supporting her. They've talked about it multiple times, but he keeps going back to not helping. The author felt like she couldn't trust him, so she did this as a last resort. \n\nNow, the action in question is tattling to his mom. Was it wrong? Well, involving his mother might be a breach of trust between the couple. Usually, couples are supposed to handle things themselves before involving family. However, the author is in a tough situation where the baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend's behavior could be neglectful, which is a serious issue. The author might have felt she had no other options left.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions were to get help for the baby and maybe make her boyfriend take responsibility. On the other hand, using a staged scenario and sending a video could be seen as manipulative, even if the underlying issue is real. There's a difference between seeking help for a child's well-being and using underhanded tactics. Also, the boyfriend might feel betrayed, which is a valid feeling in the relationship.\n\nBut considering the severity of the neglect, maybe the author had valid concerns. However, the method she chose could be problematic. Instead of involving his mother, maybe she should have tried other avenues first, like couples counseling or consulting a professional. But since she mentioned trying multiple times and he relapses, she might feel that direct action was necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But usually, in such situations, the act of involving family without the partner's consent and using a staged event might be considered crossing a line. However, the root issue is serious. The community's response in an \"Am I the Asshole?\" context would likely consider both the neglect of the child and the method used. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, but the approach she took is questionable. So maybe the answer is a bit nuanced, but the question asks for a strict A or B. \n\nLooking at similar cases, people often argue that while the issue is valid, the method (like involving parents without a conversation) makes the person the asshole. However, in cases of child neglect, the concern is more serious. The key here is whether the author's method was justified. Since she did put the baby in a situation to test him, that's manipulative. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because of the deceptive tactic, even if the problem is real. But others might argue B (No) because the neglect is severe. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because the method used is problematic, even if the intent was good.\n"
