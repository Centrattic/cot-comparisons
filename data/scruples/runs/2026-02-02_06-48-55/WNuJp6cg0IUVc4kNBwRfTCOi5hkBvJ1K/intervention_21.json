He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him neglecting their baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and the author feels overwhelmed. After multiple failed attempts to communicate, she puts the baby in his room, pretends to leave, goes to the gas station, and records a video of him neglecting the baby. She sends it to his mom, leading to her son being reamed out, and now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet's consider the ethical aspects. The author is trying to get help for a neglected child. The boyfriend's behavior could be endangering the baby. However, sending a video to his mother without his consent is a privacy invasion. She didn't confront him directly first, which might be seen as a lack of trust. On the other hand, the baby's well-being is critical. Maybe the author felt she had no other options left after trying for months.\n\nLegally, recording someone without consent can be an issue, depending on location, but the main focus here is moral/ethical. The mother-in-law's reaction might have been harsh, but the intent was to protect the child. The boyfriend's neglect is a serious issue. Is the author wrong for taking this step to protect the baby, even if the method was questionable? Alternatively, is it wrong to involve family without addressing the issue directly?\n\nAnother angle: The author might have been desperate and felt no other options. But bypassing the boyfriend and going straight to his mom could be seen as manipulative. However, the neglect is a red flag for potential child abuse. Maybe the right action was to involve authorities instead of family, but she didn't do that. \n\nSo, the author's actions were extreme but with good intentions. The boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic. The key is whether her method was appropriate. While involving the mother might not be ideal, the underlying issue of neglect is severe. It's a tough call. The answer could be that she's not entirely at fault, but there are aspects where she could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she took a drastic step without direct confrontation, maybe she's partially at fault. But given the context of potential child neglect, some might say she's justified. It's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because protecting the child's safety is paramount, even if the method was flawed. Or A if the method was wrong regardless.\n"
