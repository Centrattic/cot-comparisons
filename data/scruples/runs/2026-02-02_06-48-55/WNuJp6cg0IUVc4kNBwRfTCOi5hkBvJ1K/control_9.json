He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and this has been going on after they had a child. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. Then she decides to put the baby in his gaming room and leave, only to find out he ignored the baby. She takes a short video and sends it to his mom, which leads to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author did wrong by sending the video to his mother. The boyfriend is not fulfilling his parental duties, and the author is overwhelmed. She tried to address it, but he didn't change. So she takes a drastic step to involve his mom. \n\nSending the video could be seen as tattling, which might be a breach of privacy or overstepping. But on the other hand, the baby's well-being is at stake. The author is in a difficult situation, trying to protect the child. But maybe she should have handled it differently, like involving child protective services or seeking legal advice instead of his mother. \n\nHowever, the mom did step in and confronted him. The boyfriend is upset because of the video and the context. The author's intention was likely to get help for the child, but the method might be questionable. The question is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn some cases, involving family can be a way to address issues, but it can also cause family conflicts. The author might not be in the wrong if her primary concern was the child's safety. However, if there are other avenues she didn't explore first, that could be a point against her. But given that she tried talking and he didn't change, maybe her actions were necessary. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be B (No), because she's acting out of concern for the child, even if the method is questionable. But there's a chance others might see it as AITA (A). Hmm.\n"
