He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, plays video games instead, and only helps when the author tells him to. They've had multiple discussions, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. The author tried leaving to check on him, took a video when he ignored the baby, and sent it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset about involving his mother and the context of the video.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend's neglect. The author's action was sending a video to his mom. Is she wrong for doing that? Well, in terms of parental responsibility, if a parent is neglecting their child, that's a serious matter. However, involving family can be a sensitive issue. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to get help for the child's well-being. If the boyfriend is consistently not caring for the baby, that's a red flag. The video serves as evidence of his neglect. On the other hand, going to his mother might be seen as an overstep, especially if they hadn't resolved the issue themselves first. The boyfriend might feel that his privacy was violated by the video, even though the situation is serious.\n\nBut considering the context: the author has tried multiple times to address the problem directly without success. She's at her breaking point, so her action is a last resort. The mother's reaction (reaming him) indicates she agrees the behavior is bad. However, the method of communication might have been inappropriate. Maybe she should have involved other authorities first, like a healthcare provider or social services, but given the situation, she might not have thought of that.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural context and the dynamics between the families. In some cases, involving in-laws can be seen as meddling, but when a child is at risk, it's more about protecting the child. However, the way she presented the video might be taking advantage of the mother's influence to pressure the boyfriend, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut considering the severity of the issue\u2014child neglect\u2014it's a serious matter. The author's action, while not the most ideal, is motivated by the child's well-being. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But there's a balance between protecting the child and respecting the boyfriend's autonomy and privacy.\n"
