He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author, the mother, is really frustrated because he plays video games instead of caring for their daughter. They've talked about it multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old behavior.\n\nSo, the author decides to test him. She tells him she's leaving, but actually goes to the gas station. When she comes back, the baby is crying and he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom with an explanation. The mom calls the boyfriend and reams him out, and now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video. The author is considering divorce but is asking if she's the asshole for this action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. She's a new parent dealing with sleep deprivation and the stress of a newborn. Her partner isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, which is causing her significant stress. She's tried talking to him, but he doesn't follow through. This leads her to take drastic steps to get her message across.\n\nSending the video to his mother could be seen as a last resort. She might feel that she's not being heard and that the situation is endangering the baby. However, involving his mother without consulting him might cross a boundary. The boyfriend could feel that his mother was unnecessarily involved in a private family matter. The act of taking a video could be seen as manipulative if the context isn't clear. The 10-second clip might not show the full picture, which could be why the boyfriend says it's taken out of context.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is also problematic. Refusing to care for the baby unless prompted, staying up late but not helping, and being dismissive when asked to help are serious issues, especially with a newborn. The author's actions might be a justified attempt to highlight the problem when all other methods have failed. However, using his mother as a mediator without his consent might not be the best approach. There's a balance between protecting the child and respecting the partner's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical consideration of involving family in private matters. While the mother's intention was to get her son to take responsibility, the author's method might be seen as overstepping. The video could be a form of evidence, but sharing it with his mother might be seen as invading his privacy or manipulating the situation. The boyfriend's reaction, being upset about involving his mother, is a valid concern because it's a breach of trust in their relationship.\n\nHowever, given the context of the extreme stress and lack of support from the partner, some might argue that the author's actions were a necessary step to ensure the child's well-being. The key here is whether the end justifies the means. If the video effectively got the message across to the boyfriend (through his mother) that his behavior is unacceptable, then maybe it's justified. But if the method was dishonest (like faking leaving) and using a third party inappropriately, it's a problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way she handled it could have been better. Instead of involving his mother, she might have sought other avenues, like couples counseling or involving a professional. However, given the circumstances, her actions might be seen as a last resort to protect the child and her own mental health.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior is the root issue. Her actions, while extreme, were an attempt to address a serious problem. But she could have handled it differently. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because the primary responsibility is on the boyfriend's end. The video was a way to highlight the neglect, even if the method was questionable.\n"
