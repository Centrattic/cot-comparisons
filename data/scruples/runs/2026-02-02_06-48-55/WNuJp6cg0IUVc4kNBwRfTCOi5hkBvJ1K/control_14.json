He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with the baby, which is causing a lot of stress. The author tried talking to him, he temporarily improved, then went back. She put the baby in his room, left, took a video when he ignored the baby, sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend is neglecting his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author is exhausted and trying to get help. But, she sent a video to his mom without his consent. That's a privacy issue. Even if the intent was to help, sharing private moments without permission can be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law did confront him, which might have been effective. The boyfriend's behavior is harmful, so maybe the author felt she had no other options. But, the method of sending the video could be problematic. Maybe she should have addressed it directly with him first or sought counseling instead of involving his mother. However, the boyfriend wasn't responsive to previous attempts, so she might feel desperate.\n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a tough call. While the intent was to protect the child and address the neglect, the method involved privacy violation. But the boyfriend's actions are also negligent. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort. Depending on cultural norms, some might say she overstepped by involving family, while others might understand her desperation. \n\nI think the key points are the privacy breach and the lack of direct communication. However, given the severity of the neglect, her actions might be justified as a protective measure. But ethically, sharing the video without consent is wrong. So, maybe she's partially in the wrong. But since the boyfriend is the main problem, maybe she isn't entirely. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might say A. Hmm.\n"
