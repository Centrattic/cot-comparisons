He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person who sent a video to their boyfriend's mother showing him ignoring their baby. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, and the author feels overwhelmed. They tried talking to him, even threatening to leave, but he didn't change. Then they took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: sending a video to the boyfriend's mother. Is that appropriate? Well, the boyfriend's mother called him out, which is a good outcome in one sense, but the method might be questionable. In many relationships, involving family without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend might feel that his personal issues are being exposed to family without mutual discussion first.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic. He's not participating in childcare, which is a major issue, especially with a newborn. The author has tried multiple times to address it, so it's clear it's not a one-time thing. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for sending the video. The key points here are the method of addressing the problem and the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention was to get help from the mother to make the boyfriend change his behavior. However, the approach might have been a betrayal of trust. Relationships often require partners to handle conflicts directly before involving third parties, especially family members. The boyfriend might feel that the author didn't give him a chance to resolve the issue on his own, which could damage their relationship further.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's inaction is also a serious issue. The author is under a lot of stress, and the situation is affecting their well-being and the child's care. Maybe the author felt they had no other options left. But the method of involving the mother directly could be seen as tattling, which might not be the best approach in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the boyfriend's behavior is wrong, but the author's method of addressing it by involving the mother without discussing it with him first might be considered in the wrong. The correct approach would be to try resolving it directly, perhaps with couples counseling or mediation, rather than involving family. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
