He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who sent the video to the boyfriend's mom) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games while the baby cries, only helps when the author tells him to, and won't hold the baby unless it's calm. They've talked about it multiple times, but he reverts. The author tried a last effort by leaving the baby with him and going to the gas station. When she returned, he was ignoring the crying baby. She videoed it and sent it to his mom. Now, he's upset about involving his mom and the video being out of context.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's lack of parental responsibility and the author's actions. The author's motivation was to get help from his mom, which worked (she reamed him). But the boyfriend is upset about the video and involving his mom.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has tried to address it directly without success. Sending the video to his mom could be seen as a last resort to protect the baby. However, involving the mother directly might be a breach of privacy or trust. But given the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting an infant\u2014it's a reasonable action if other methods have failed. The author's intent was to ensure the child's well-being, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, so the author's action might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it without involving his mom first. But considering the circumstances and the lack of improvement, it's a tough call. The answer likely leans toward B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions were to protect the child and address neglect, which is a serious matter.\n"
