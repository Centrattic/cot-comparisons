He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author is the parent who's handling most of the childcare, which is causing a lot of stress and conflict. She tried talking to him, but he keeps reverting back to not helping. She even staged a scenario where she left the baby with him and then took a video of him ignoring her to send to his mom. Now he's upset because she involved his mother and took the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is clearly struggling with the lack of support from her partner. Being a new parent is already tough, and if one parent isn't contributing, that can lead to burnout. The boyfriend's behavior sounds neglectful and dismissive, not taking the baby's needs seriously. The author's actions were a reaction to this ongoing problem after multiple attempts to resolve it directly.\n\nBut then there's the method she used. Tattling to his mother might be seen as overstepping. In many cultures, parents can be protective of their children's relationships, and involving a parent-in-law can complicate family dynamics. Also, taking a video without his knowledge could be considered deceptive. Even though the intention was to show the reality of the situation, the method might be seen as manipulative. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect the child and address her partner's neglect. She felt she couldn't trust him, which is a serious concern. The key here is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. While tattling might be frowned upon, the alternative could be worse if the neglect continues unchecked. On the other hand, involving a parent without discussing it first could be seen as bypassing the partner, which might not be the healthiest way to handle the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is legal and ethical aspects. If the author believes there's neglect, perhaps she should involve child services instead of a family member. But the question is about interpersonal relationships, not legal. The main conflict is between the couple and their family. The mother-in-law's reaction suggests that the approach was unexpected and possibly not the best way to handle it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's in a tough spot, but the way she handled it might not have been the best approach. Maybe there were other steps she could have taken before involving the mother. However, given the severity of the neglect, some might argue her actions were necessary. But in terms of relationship dynamics, bypassing her partner and using a video to tattle could be seen as wrong, even if the intent was good. So I think the answer is A, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
