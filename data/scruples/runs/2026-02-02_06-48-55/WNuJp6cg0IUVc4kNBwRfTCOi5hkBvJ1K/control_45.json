He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, only when prompted, and doesn't take responsibility. The author tried talking about it multiple times, but he goes back to old habits. She's at her breaking point and put the baby in his room, then left to get gas. When she came back, he was ignoring the baby's cries. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFactors to consider: The main issue is the boyfriend's neglect of the child, which is a serious matter. The author tried various methods to communicate with her partner but he didn't improve. She felt she had no other options left. Tattling to his mother might be seen as involving a third party without direct communication, but the stakes here are about child care. \n\nPossible angles: Is there a better way she could have handled it? Maybe, but given her desperation and the fact that the baby's well-being is at risk, she might feel justified. However, sending a video without context could be problematic. The boyfriend argues it was out of context. But in this case, the context is clear\u2014he's ignoring the crying baby. \n\nAlso, the mother called him out, which might have been effective. But the boyfriend is upset at the author for involving his mom. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort to protect the child. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have sought other help, like counseling or legal steps, but maybe she didn't know how. The act of sending the video might be necessary to show the mother the reality of the situation. However, involving the mother might not be the best approach, but the mother's response was to confront him, which worked. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly the main issue. The author's action, though perhaps not ideal, was to protect her child. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that she should have handled it differently, but given the circumstances, her priority is the baby's safety. So I think the answer is B.\n"
