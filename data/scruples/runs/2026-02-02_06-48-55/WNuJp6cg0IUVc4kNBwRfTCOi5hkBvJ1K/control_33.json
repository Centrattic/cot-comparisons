He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author sent a video to his mom to make her confront him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together five years and a daughter for six months. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby care, instead playing video games. The author tried talking, but he improves briefly then goes back. She's considering divorce, staged a scenario where she left, then took a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset she involved his mom and said the video was out of context. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The main issue is her decision to involve his mother. In some cultures, involving family might be common, but in others, it can be seen as overstepping. The author's intention was to get his mother to reprimand him, which worked. But did she have the right to do that without his consent?\n\nOn one hand, she's exhausted and the situation is dire with a newborn. She's trying to make him take responsibility. On the other hand, sharing private moments with a family member without consent could be a breach of trust. The boyfriend might feel she violated their privacy or didn't trust him to handle the problem themselves. \n\nIs there a better way she could have handled it? Maybe, like involving a counselor or legal steps if divorce is on the table. But she felt like she couldn't trust him, and the situation was affecting their daughter. \n\nThe video is a key element. Taking a video is a form of evidence, but using it to confront his mom might not be the best approach. However, given the context, she might have felt desperate. \n\nIn terms of right vs wrong, it's a judgment call. She's trying to protect her child, but the method is questionable. Some might say she's justified because the child's well-being is at stake. Others might say she overstepped by involving his mom. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often looks at intentions and proportionality. Her intention was to get help for the baby, but the method involved her partner's mother, which can be a sensitive issue. The answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B) because the situation is extreme and she's trying to protect her child. However, others might argue she should have handled it differently. But given the options, the answer is B.\n"
