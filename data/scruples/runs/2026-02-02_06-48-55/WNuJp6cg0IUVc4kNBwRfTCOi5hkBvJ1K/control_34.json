He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after multiple discussions, she decides to put the baby in his room and leave, then video the incident.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend refuses to help, despite being a parent. The author feels overwhelmed and has tried talking to him multiple times. She puts the baby in his room as a test, records a 10-second video, and sends it to his mom. His mom calls him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the context of the video.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is neglectful. Parents have responsibilities, and if he's not fulfilling his role, that's a serious issue. The author is trying to hold him accountable. However, involving his mother might not be the best approach. Typically, parents might prefer to handle family matters without involving in-laws. Also, using a video as evidence might come across as manipulative or an invasion of privacy, even if it's a short clip. But given the circumstances\u2014baby's welfare is at stake\u2014maybe the author's actions are understandable. She's trying to get help because she's at her breaking point. The boyfriend's response is problematic too; ignoring a crying baby is inexcusable. \n\nOn the other hand, the method of \"tattling\" could be seen as undermining the relationship. Maybe she should have sought other support first, like counseling or involving a professional. But given that he's not improving despite her efforts, her actions might be justified. The key is whether the video was a reasonable step. Since it's a public location (his gaming room) and the baby's safety is involved, it's a gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach might be a bit extreme, the neglectful behavior of the boyfriend makes her actions somewhat understandable. The answer is B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
