He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is at fault for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite discussions. The author tried multiple times to talk to him, and he reverted back each time. Finally, she staged a scenario where she left and took a video of him ignoring the baby. She sent it to his mom, which led to him being reprimanded and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and for the video.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mother is upset because her son is neglecting the baby, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, the author tried to communicate, and she took a video as evidence. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, ensuring the baby's well-being is paramount. If the boyfriend is indeed neglecting the child, then the mother might have a reason to intervene. However, the method of intervention\u2014sending a video to his mother\u2014could be seen as invading privacy or using a trap. The author's intention was to show the neglect, but staging the situation (pretending to leave) could be considered manipulative. However, if the neglect is real and she's tried everything else, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, involving a parent in a marital dispute can be seen as crossing a boundary. The boyfriend might feel that his mother was brought into a private matter without his consent, which could strain family relations. The video itself, even if short, might be taken out of context, which the boyfriend claims. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping by using a parent as a third party to enforce responsibility.\n\nBut considering the circumstances\u2014postpartum stress, the baby's safety, and the boyfriend's consistent neglect\u2014the author is in a desperate situation. The alternatives (like involving child services) might be extreme, but the video was a way to document the issue. However, the method of using a trap could be problematic because it's deceitful, even if the intention is good.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. The author's intent was to help the baby, but the method involved deception and family intervention. If the boyfriend is truly not fulfilling his duties, the author's actions might be understandable. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the child's well-being is a top priority, and if all else failed, her actions were justified to protect the child. However, some might argue she should have handled it differently. But given the context of a 5-year relationship and repeated failures to communicate, her actions might be seen as a last resort to ensure the baby's safety.\n"
