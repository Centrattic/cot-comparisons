He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending a video of their boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user and their boyfriend have been together for five years, and they have a six-month-old daughter. Since the baby's birth, the relationship has gotten worse because the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, only helps when the baby is crying if the user tells him to, and he refuses to hold the baby unless the user hands her over when he's watching TV. He also stays up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby wakes up. They've talked about this multiple times, and the user has even threatened to leave, which made him improve briefly. \n\nIn a last attempt, the user put the baby in his gaming room and told him she was leaving, but she went to the gas station. When she came back, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video of this and sent it to his mom with an explanation. The mom called him and reamed him out, and now the boyfriend is upset with the user for involving his mom and taking the video. The user is considering divorce but is unsure if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend is neglecting his parental duties, the user tried to resolve the issue multiple times without success, and then took the step of informing his mother. The question is whether sending the video was wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the boyfriend's actions. Neglecting a baby's needs is serious. He's not fulfilling his responsibilities, which can affect the child's well-being. The user has tried to talk to him, and even when he improves for a week, he goes back to ignoring the baby. This suggests a pattern of behavior that isn't changing despite efforts. \n\nThen, the user's actions: she put the baby in his room and left, then came back to find him ignoring her. She took a video as evidence and sent it to his mom. Her intention was likely to get his mother to intervene since previous methods didn't work. But now the boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and \"took the video out of context.\" \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, the father's behavior is concerning. The user is trying to protect the baby's well-being. However, involving the mother might be seen as bypassing the boyfriend's autonomy. But given that he's not taking responsibility, maybe it's justified. Also, sharing the video could be seen as necessary to show the truth, especially if the boyfriend is denying the issue. \n\nBut legally or socially, there might be nuances. In some contexts, sharing private moments without consent could be problematic. However, the situation involves child welfare, which is a higher priority. If the boyfriend's behavior is endangering the child, then the user's actions could be seen as justified. \n\nHowever, the user didn't go to the authorities first. She went to the boyfriend's mom instead. That might be a point against her. But if the mother is in a position to influence the boyfriend, maybe that's a better step than immediately involving legal or child services, especially if the user hasn't done that yet. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might be overstepping by using his mother as a mediator. But given the boyfriend's lack of improvement despite multiple warnings, maybe it's a necessary step. \n\nIn terms of the relationship, the user is clearly frustrated and has tried all options. The boyfriend's response is to be upset about the video and involving his mom, which could indicate he's defensive and not taking the issue seriously. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user's actions were a last resort to protect the baby and possibly get help. While involving the mother might not be ideal in a perfect relationship, the boyfriend's neglect is the root problem. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong, but there could be arguments either way. But given the severity of the situation, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
