He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a parent dealing with a boyfriend who isn't helping with their newborn daughter. The boyfriend is ignoring the baby's needs, playing video games instead, and the author feels overwhelmed. They tried talking about it, but the boyfriend keeps going back to old habits. In a moment of frustration, the author left the baby with the boyfriend, went to a gas station, and then took a 10-second video of the boyfriend ignoring the baby. She sent it to his mother, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has tried communication and it hasn't worked. The baby's well-being is at stake here. The act of sending the video to the mother might be seen as tattling, but the underlying problem is significant. \n\nOn one hand, tattling can be seen as interfering or not trusting the partner. But in this case, it's about a child's care. The mother-in-law intervened, which might have been necessary if the boyfriend wasn't responsive. The author's actions could be justified as a last resort to protect the child. However, maybe there were other steps she could have taken before involving the mother. But considering the situation, she tried multiple times to communicate and it didn't work. The video was a short, factual recording, not a setup. \n\nThe boyfriend being upset about \"taking a video out of context\" might be missing the point. The author's intent was to show the reality of the situation. The mother's reaction could be seen as supporting the child's needs. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's actions, while possibly harsh, were aimed at ensuring the baby's care and addressing a serious neglect. She's likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
