He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games and only helps when the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, but he doesn't change. The author tried a test by leaving the baby in his room and going to the gas station. When she came back, he was ignoring the baby, so she took a video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video.\n\nSo, the main question is whether sending the video to his mother is justified. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: She put the baby in his room, left, came back, took a video when she saw he wasn't helping, and sent it to his mom. She did this after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. Her intention was likely to get his mom to intervene since he wasn't listening.\n\nPossible angles: On one hand, she's dealing with a partner who isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, leading to her exhaustion and considering divorce. On the other hand, she went to his mom instead of confronting him directly, which might be seen as bypassing him. Sending a video could be seen as evidence, but it's also a private moment. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken without his knowledge and shared without his consent, which could be a privacy issue.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If the boyfriend wasn't helping the baby, the author might feel desperate. However, involving his mom without his consent could be seen as overstepping, especially if they were supposed to handle the issue themselves. The act of recording a private moment without consent might be problematic, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut also, the boyfriend's behavior is neglectful towards the child, which is a serious issue. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort to protect the child's well-being when other methods failed.\n\nDifferent perspectives: Some might say she's justified because the child's needs are being ignored. Others might say she should have handled it within the relationship first, without involving family.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intention was to protect the child, but the method might have been inappropriate. However, given the severity of the situation (child neglect), some might argue that her actions were necessary. But others might say that she should have addressed it directly with her partner first without involving his mother.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the answer is not clear-cut. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). Given that she's in a desperate situation and the child's well-being is at risk, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she bypassed her partner and involved his family, that could be seen as wrong. However, since he wasn't responding to her, maybe it's understandable. I think it's B (No).\n"
