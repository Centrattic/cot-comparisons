He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare despite multiple discussions. The author decided to leave the baby in his room, go out, and then send a video of him ignoring the baby to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is causing significant stress on the author. She tried communication, but it didn't work. Then she took a video as evidence and sent it to his mother. The key points are the boyfriend's behavior, the attempts to resolve it, and the method she used to involve his mother.\n\nOn one hand, ensuring the baby's well-being is crucial. The boyfriend's neglect could be harmful, so the mother-in-law's intervention might be necessary. However, the method the author used\u2014using a video and going behind her boyfriend's back\u2014might be seen as invasive. Did she give him enough notice or warnings before taking this step? She mentioned trying communication, but maybe there were other steps she could have taken first, like involving a counselor or legal measures if there's a custody concern.\n\nOn the other hand, being a new parent is stressful, and the author is clearly overwhelmed. The boyfriend's behavior isn't just inconvenient; it's neglectful. If she's considering divorce, the situation is dire. The act of sending the video to his mother could be seen as a last resort to get help. However, involving family can sometimes escalate tensions and isn't always the best approach. It might have been better to document the incidents and seek professional help instead.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the tattling aspect. But if the baby's safety is at risk, the tattling might be justified. However, the method could be questionable. Did she have a duty to protect the child, and if so, is going to the mother the best way? Maybe she should have involved child protective services or a family lawyer instead of the mother-in-law, who might not be the best mediator here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend might feel betrayed by his mother's intervention, especially if he didn't expect that. The author did mention that she told him she was leaving and then went to the gas station, but he still ignored the baby. The video was a direct proof of his neglect. If the mother-in-law reamed him out, that could lead to his own introspection, but it's also possible that this approach damaged the relationship further.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intentions were to protect her child, which is a valid and important goal. However, the method chosen might not have been the most ethical or effective. There's a balance between protecting the child and maintaining trust and communication in the relationship. The author might have felt desperate, but escalating the conflict by involving family without the boyfriend's consent could be seen as wrong, even if her intentions were good.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were necessary for the child's well-being. If the boyfriend's neglect was severe and immediate, then her actions could be justified. However, if there were other steps she could have taken without involving family, that might have been better. The act of \"tattling\" isn't inherently right or wrong, but the context here is critical. The author's desperation and the child's safety are key factors.\n"
