He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, which is causing significant stress. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he relapses into old habits. She even staged a scenario where she left and put the baby in his room, then recorded him ignoring her. After sending the video to his mom, he's upset, and she's considering leaving him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's neglect and the author's actions. The video was a way to show his mother the reality of the situation. He's not taking care of the baby, which is a serious issue affecting the child's well-being. The author felt she couldn't trust him, which led her to stage the situation. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, tattling might be seen as bypassing direct communication, but in this case, he's not being receptive to her concerns. The video serves as evidence of neglect, which is a serious matter. Parents have a duty to care for their child, and if one parent is not fulfilling that, it's a valid concern. Involving family might be a last resort when all other methods fail. \n\nHowever, the method of staging the situation (putting the baby in his room and then recording) could be seen as manipulative. But given the severity of the issue, it's understandable she felt desperate. The boyfriend's behavior is harmful, and the mother-in-law's reaction might have been necessary to wake him up. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. Since the neglect is ongoing and affecting the child's well-being, her actions might be seen as protective rather than tattling. So, the answer would likely be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
