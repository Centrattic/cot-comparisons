He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend, and after having a daughter, things have gotten really bad. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, plays video games a lot, ignores the baby when it's crying, and she's been trying to talk to him about it without success. \n\nShe tried a last effort by leaving and going to the gas station, but when she came back, the baby was crying and he wasn't doing anything. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the main issue is the boyfriend not fulfilling his parental duties. She's the one handling all the baby's needs, which is causing a strain on their relationship. She's been trying to communicate this to him, but he keeps regressing. \n\nShe took a video as evidence, which is a bit of a \"tattling\" move. But considering the circumstances\u2014her daughter's well-being is at stake\u2014it might be understandable. However, sending the video to his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. She might have thought that involving his mom was necessary to make him take responsibility, but maybe there were other ways to handle it first, like consulting a counselor or legal options if they were married.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend isn't stepping up, and the mother is trying to protect her child. The act of tattling here is a parenting issue. But in the U.S., parents have the right to involve family members in such situations, especially if there's a child's welfare involved. However, the method of using a video without consent might be questionable, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe mother might feel justified because the father isn't helping, but the tattling could have caused more conflict. But if the father is neglecting the child, then the mother has a duty to act. The key points are the father's neglect and the mother's attempt to get him to help. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the mother is right in trying to protect her child, then sending the video might not be in the wrong. However, using his mother's involvement could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's a cultural expectation that parents shouldn't interfere in adult children's relationships. But the child's needs come first, so the mother's actions, while maybe harsh, could be understandable.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's trying to protect her child and hold the father accountable. However, some might argue that she should have handled it differently, like seeking professional help instead of involving his mother. But given the severity of the neglect, her actions might be justified.\n"
