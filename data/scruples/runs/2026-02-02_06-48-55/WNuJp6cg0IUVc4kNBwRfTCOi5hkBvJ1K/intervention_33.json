He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation involves a lot of conflict about childcare responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author feels overwhelmed. She tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't follow through. Then she takes a video of him ignoring the baby and sends it to his mom, leading to conflict. \n\nThe key points are: the author's actions of tattling and using a video. Is that justified? Well, she's in a stressful situation, possibly dealing with postpartum stress or exhaustion. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. Sending the video to his mom might be seen as involving family in a personal conflict, which could be considered a breach of trust. But on the other hand, she's trying to address a problem that's affecting their child's well-being.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She did try to talk to him, but he didn't change. Maybe the video was a last resort to get his mother involved. However, involving in-laws can complicate things. The boyfriend feels betrayed because she took the video and shared it. That could be a valid point\u2014his reaction might stem from feeling that his privacy was invaded or that the situation was misrepresented.\n\nBut considering the child's welfare, if the father is neglecting the baby, is it wrong to take action? There's a line between privacy and child neglect. If the author genuinely believes the child is being harmed by his neglect, then she's acting in the child's best interest. However, the method of involving his mother without his knowledge might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. If the author's intent was to protect the child and she felt she had no other options, then B (not in the wrong). But if she's using the video as a manipulative tactic and not giving her partner a fair chance, then A (in the wrong). The situation is complex. The video is a direct evidence of neglect, which is a serious matter. On the flip side, involving his mother without his consent is a breach of privacy. But given that the child's well-being is at stake, maybe the author is justified. The boyfriend's behavior is the root problem here. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because neglecting a child is a serious issue. She tried to resolve it through communication first. The video was evidence, and involving his mother was a way to get support. The boyfriend's reaction is valid but perhaps he's in the wrong for neglecting the child. So, answer B.\n"
