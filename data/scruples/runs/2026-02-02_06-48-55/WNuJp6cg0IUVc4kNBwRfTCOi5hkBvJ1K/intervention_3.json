He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing a lot of stress. The author tried talking to him, even threatening to leave, but he doesn't change. She then stages a situation where she leaves and records him ignoring the baby, then sends the video to his mom. His mom confronts him, and now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the father isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, which is a serious issue because the baby's well-being is at stake. The mother is clearly distressed and seeking help. On the other hand, involving the mother might be seen as overstepping or using manipulation, even if the intention was to get him to change his behavior.\n\nI should consider boundaries. In a relationship, couples typically resolve issues between themselves. Bringing in family, especially without the partner's consent, could be seen as crossing a line. However, the mother's actions were to protect the child, which is a valid concern. The video was to show the mother the reality of the situation, which might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Did she try all possible communication methods? She said she tried multiple times and even had a temporary improvement. The staged situation might have been necessary to get evidence, but the method of sending it to his mom could have been handled differently. Perhaps she should have sought other support first, like counseling or involving child services if there's neglect, instead of involving his mother directly.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context. The act of recording without his knowledge might be ethically questionable, but it's done to protect the child. There's a conflict between the mother's duty to protect the child and respecting the partner's autonomy.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the father's neglect is a serious issue, and the mother's actions were to address that. However, using the mother-in-law as a way to confront him might not be the best approach. It could damage family relationships and the trust in the relationship. The author's intention was to help the child, but the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the situation is about the child's well-being, but the method of handling it could have been better. However, the key is whether she was wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because she overstepped by involving his mother. If B (no), it's because the neglect is severe and she had valid reasons.\n"
