He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a woman whose boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. He plays video games a lot and only helps when she's crying and she tells him to. She's tried talking to him, even threatening to leave, but he keeps going back to his old habits. So, she's at her breaking point. She decides to test his commitment by leaving the baby in his room and going to the gas station. When she comes back, the baby is crying and he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video of him not responding and sends it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent. The author has tried multiple times to communicate the problem, but he hasn't made lasting changes. The situation is affecting their relationship and her mental health. She's considering divorce, which is a major step, and this action was part of a last-ditch effort.\n\nSending the video to the boyfriend's mother could be seen as a way to hold him accountable, especially since he's not heeding her requests. However, involving his mother might be a breach of privacy or trust between the couple. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken without his consent and shared in a way that's damaging to his reputation. The mother's reaction (reaming him) could cause tension in the family, and the boyfriend is upset that his partner went around him to talk to his mom.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is in a difficult situation with a newborn and a partner who isn't supporting her. The video was taken to document a real issue when the baby is in distress. The key point here is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. If the boyfriend is truly neglecting their child, then taking action to protect the child's well-being is important. However, the method of involving his mother without his knowledge could be problematic. Normally, in a relationship, partners should address such issues directly, and involving family might be seen as a step too far unless there's a valid reason to believe the child is in danger.\n\nBut since the author has already tried multiple times to communicate and the boyfriend hasn't changed, maybe she felt that she had no other options left. The fact that she had a video evidence could be necessary to show the reality of the situation, especially if she's planning to take legal steps like divorce. However, sharing it with his mother might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have gone to child services if there was neglect, but the situation is more about parenting responsibilities rather than immediate danger.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending the video. On one side, she's trying to protect the baby and herself. On the other, she's taking a step that could be seen as violating their relationship's trust. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural norms or specific legal contexts, but generally, involving family in a dispute can be seen as crossing a line unless it's for the child's safety. Since the author was considering divorce, maybe she's justified in trying to gather evidence, but the method of involving the mother might not be the right approach. However, given the circumstances, her actions could be understood as a last resort. But the key is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend is not helping, but she's taking a step that could be seen as manipulative or overstepping.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's in a desperate situation trying to protect the baby and herself, and the video was to show the reality. However, another perspective is that she shouldn't have involved his mother without his knowledge. But given that he's not helping and she's at her limit, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
