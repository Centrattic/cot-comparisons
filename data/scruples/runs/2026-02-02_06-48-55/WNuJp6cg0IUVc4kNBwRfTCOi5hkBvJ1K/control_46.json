He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, refuses to care for the baby unless prompted, and ignores her needs while he plays video games. The author tried multiple times to address this, even telling him she can't handle it, but he only improves for a week. Then she puts the baby in his gaming room, leaves for a gas station, and comes back to find the baby screaming while he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom, who then calls him out. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's consistent neglect of the baby, the author's attempts to communicate and resolve the issue, and her decision to involve the mother. The question is whether her actions (sending the video) make her at fault (AITA).\n\nSo, in terms of ethics, is the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic. Neglecting a child is a serious issue. The author tried communication but it didn't work. She felt she couldn't trust him, so she did an experiment by leaving the baby with him and then documenting the neglect. Then she involved his mother, which is a parent of her partner. \n\nNow, in many cultures, involving a parent in a conflict between partners can be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. However, the situation here is about child neglect, which is a significant concern. The mother-in-law's reaction might have been harsh, but the author's intent was to get help for the baby. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? On one hand, she's trying to protect the child, which is a valid priority. On the other, she didn't discuss with the boyfriend's mom before sending the video. However, given the urgency of the situation and the repeated neglect, her actions could be justified as a last resort to ensure the child's well-being. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling betrayed, but the author's main concern was the child's care. \n\nIt's a tough call. If the boyfriend was truly aware of the problem and not responsive, then the author's actions might be seen as necessary. However, involving family without discussing it first can strain relationships. But considering the severity of the issue (child neglect), the author's actions might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
