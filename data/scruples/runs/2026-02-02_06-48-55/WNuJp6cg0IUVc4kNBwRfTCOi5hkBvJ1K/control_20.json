He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't taking care of their baby, especially when the baby cries. The author tried to confront him multiple times, but he only improves temporarily. She decided to test him by leaving the baby with him and going to the gas station, then sent a video of him ignoring the baby to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset, and the author is considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author feels overwhelmed and unsupported. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. She took a video as evidence and shared it with his mother. The boyfriend claims she took the video out of context. The question is whether she's at fault for this action.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a red flag. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get consistent results. Her action of sending the video to his mom could be seen as trying to get support or hold him accountable. However, involving his mother without his consent might breach trust, which is important in a relationship. \n\nBut wait, the baby's well-being is a priority. If the author felt she couldn't trust him and was in a crisis, maybe the action was justified as a last resort. On the other hand, the video was a 10-second clip, and if it's taken out of context, it might not show the full story. The boyfriend might have had a reason, even if it's not valid, for not attending to the baby at that moment. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to leave the baby with him while she went to the gas station\u2014was that a reasonable test? If she didn't have the baby's safety at risk during that time, maybe it was a necessary step. But if she left the baby unattended, that could be a problem. The scenario says the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her, so maybe she left her there to see his reaction. \n\nIn legal terms, sharing such a video without consent could be an issue, but in family dynamics, when one parent is neglectful, the other might need external help. The mother-in-law's reaction and the boyfriend's response are part of the fallout. The author is at her breaking point, so her actions might be seen as desperate rather than malicious. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the video was a means to protect the child and get her partner to take responsibility, maybe not. However, the method of involving his mother and using a video might have been a breach of privacy and trust, which can damage the relationship further. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because she's trying to protect her child and address a serious issue. But there's a nuance here. Involving his mother might not be the best approach, but the author's intentions are valid. The boyfriend's neglect is the main problem, and she's taking steps to make him aware of the consequences. However, the ethical aspect of sharing a private moment without consent complicates it. \n\nBut considering the well-being of the child and the fact that the boyfriend wasn't responding to direct communication, the author might be justified. The question is whether the ends (trying to get him to take responsibility) justify the means (involving his mom with a video). In some cultures or family dynamics, this is a common step. In others, it's seen as overstepping. \n\nThe author is considering divorce, so she's already at a breaking point. The act of sending the video was a way to show his mom the reality of the situation, which might be a valid action if other attempts failed. However, the boyfriend's upset about the video being out of context is a point to consider. Maybe the video isn't the full story, but the neglect itself is the bigger issue. \n\nI think the answer is B because the author's actions were driven by the need to protect her child and address neglect, which is a serious matter. While involving his mother isn't ideal, the boyfriend's refusal to help is the root problem. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to hold him accountable, especially if it's a last effort before divorce.\n"
