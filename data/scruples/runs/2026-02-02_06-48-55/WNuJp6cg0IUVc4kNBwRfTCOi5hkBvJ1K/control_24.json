He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only doing so when the author tells him to. He plays games instead, and even when the baby cries, he doesn't respond unless prompted. They've talked about this multiple times, but he goes back to old habits. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and went to the gas station. When she came back, the baby was crying, he was ignoring her. She took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions: she took a video to show her boyfriend's neglect to his mother. The boyfriend got upset because she involved his mom and said the video was out of context. The author is considering divorce but is wondering if she was wrong to send the video.\n\nHmm. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning. Not helping with a newborn, especially when the author is clearly overwhelmed. The author tried multiple times to communicate, but no change. The video was a last resort. Sending it to the mother might have been intended to get her to help, but it could be seen as involving family unnecessarily. However, the mother might have been a better avenue than the boyfriend, who's not listening.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's in a stressful situation. The baby's well-being is at stake. She tried to get through to her partner but failed. Using the mother as a last resort could be understandable. On the flip side, involving his mother might be an overstep, especially if they were supposed to handle it themselves. But given the circumstances, the mother might have been able to influence the boyfriend's behavior, which the author couldn't. Also, the video itself\u2014taking a 10-second clip might seem like taking it out of context, but if it's a clear example of neglect, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe question is whether the method was wrong. The author's intention was to protect the child and get help. But methods can be debatable. However, in cases of child neglect, taking action to ensure the child's safety is often seen as justified. The mother reamed him, so maybe the author's action had a positive effect. The boyfriend being upset about being tattled on is his reaction, but the author's action was to address a serious issue.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong. Her action was a response to neglect, and she tried to involve family to get help after multiple failed attempts. The method is questionable, but the intent is protective.\n"
