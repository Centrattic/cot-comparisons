He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who asked the question is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, had a baby six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, plays games instead, only helps when the mother asks, and doesn't pick up the baby unless she hands her over. The mother has tried talking to him, and he improves briefly but then goes back. She's considering divorce and did this \"last ditch effort\" by putting the baby in his room and leaving to get gas, then came back and found him ignoring the baby, took a video, sent it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset she involved his mom and says the video is out of context.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is clearly overwhelmed. The father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which affects the child's well-being. She tried multiple times to communicate, but he's not consistent. Putting the baby in his room and leaving could be a test to see if he'd step up. When she comes back and he's ignoring the baby, she documents it. Sending it to his mother might be an attempt to get support or make him realize the issue. But maybe she shouldn't have involved his mom without talking to him first, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother-in-law can be a sensitive issue. It might cause tension in the relationship and could be seen as undermining the boyfriend. However, the father's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious matter. If the mother feels she's at her breaking point, maybe she had no better option left after exhausting other methods. But did she handle it the right way?\n\nThe boyfriend might feel betrayed that his mother was brought in without his knowledge. However, the act of sending the video could be justified if it's to protect the child. But the video being a short clip could be misleading if taken out of context. The mother's intention was to show neglect, but the boyfriend argues it's out of context. Without knowing the full context, it's hard to say if the video is misleading, but the mother's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, was she wrong? It's a tough call. She's in a stressful situation, and maybe she felt she had no other options. However, involving the mother without discussing with the boyfriend might have been a misstep. But given the circumstances, she might not be entirely at fault. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the father's neglect is a serious issue, and she's trying to hold him accountable. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because she bypassed communication and involved family. But considering the potential harm to the child, maybe B is better.\n"
