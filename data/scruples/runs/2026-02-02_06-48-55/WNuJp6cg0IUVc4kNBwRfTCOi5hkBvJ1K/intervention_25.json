He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together five years and has a six-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby; he's playing video games instead. The author has tried talking to him, but he only improves for a week each time before reverting. She took a video of him ignoring the baby after she left to go to the gas station and sent it to his mom. Now he's mad at her for involving his mom and for the video, and she's considering divorce.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it was wrong for her to send the video to his mother. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities as a father. The author is clearly struggling and has tried to resolve the issue through communication without success. The baby's well-being is at stake. Sending the video as evidence to his mother could be seen as a last resort to get him to take responsibility. His mother intervened, which might have led to some change.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother without his consent might be seen as crossing a boundary. People often feel that personal family matters should be handled within the couple first. By involving his mother, she might be seen as undermining their relationship and causing additional stress. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt betrayed, which could worsen their situation.\n\nBut considering the context, the author is in a vulnerable position as a parent. She's being overwhelmed by the baby's needs without support. The boyfriend's behavior is not just neglectful but also dismissive of her efforts. The video was a direct example of his neglect. In such cases, people might argue that the ends justify the means, especially when a child's welfare is involved.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how to address the issue. Maybe there are other ways, like involving a counselor or professional help, before involving in-laws. But in her desperation, she might not see those options. The key question is whether her actions were justified in protecting her child's welfare, even if it meant breaching privacy or trust in the relationship.\n\nI think there's nuance here. While tattling can be seen as wrong, the severity of the neglect and the lack of response to previous attempts to address it might mitigate that. However, it's possible that the mother-in-law's intervention could be negative or not effective, but in this case, it worked. Still, the act of involving the mother without the partner's consent might be considered overstepping, even if well-intentioned.\n\nI'm torn. The author's actions were driven by the need to protect her child, which is a strong justification. But the method of doing so could be seen as crossing a line. However, if all other options have been exhausted and the child's well-being is at risk, maybe it's understandable. But in terms of the relationship, it's a breach of trust. So, is she in the wrong? If the focus is on the child's needs, she's not. If the focus is on the couple's privacy and trust, she is. The answer likely depends on cultural or personal values. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and considering the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, which often looks at social norms, I think the community might split. But in the end, the mother's decision to prioritize the baby's welfare despite the relationship consequences might be seen as understandable, making her not in the wrong. But maybe the act of involving the mother without consent is seen as wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Given the circumstances, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the child's safety is paramount, and she's reached the end of her rope.\n"
