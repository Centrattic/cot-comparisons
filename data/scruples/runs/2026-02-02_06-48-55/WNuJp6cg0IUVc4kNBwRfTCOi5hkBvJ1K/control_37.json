He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him not caring for their baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only does so when the author tells him, and even then he's resentful. They've talked about it multiple times, but he goes back to his old ways. The author tried a move where she left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, which led to his mom confronting him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the context of the video.\n\nSo, the key points are whether the author's actions were justified. The author is in a tough spot here. Her main issue is that her partner isn't fulfilling his parental duties, leading to exhaustion and possible breakdown of their marriage. She tried to communicate and he didn't change, so she took a drastic step to get his attention.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. A parent should be responsible for their child's needs, and refusing to do so is neglectful. The author is trying to protect her child and herself by making her partner take responsibility. However, the method she used\u2014inviting his mom into the situation and using a video as evidence\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary. Inviting in a family member might be seen as not handling the issue directly between them first, which could be a point against her. But considering the context, she's in a vulnerable situation with a newborn, and the stakes are high for the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have addressed this within the relationship first, maybe through counseling or other means, rather than involving his mother. However, given that he hasn't changed despite multiple discussions, and the author feels she can't trust him, her actions could be viewed as a necessary step to protect the child.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, being upset about the video and context, might be missing the point. The video is evidence of neglect, and his mother's reaction leading to a confrontation could be a turning point. The author's main goal is the child's welfare, so her actions were likely motivated by concern, not just to get back at her boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intentions were to protect the child, which is a strong justification. However, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach of trust. But in the context of parental neglect, some might argue that the higher priority is the child's safety and well-being, making the author's actions understandable, even if the method is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But it's a close call. The key factors are the boyfriend's neglect and the author's desperate attempt to make him take responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
