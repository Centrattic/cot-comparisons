He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a mother dealing with a boyfriend who isn't helping with their baby. He plays video games a lot and only helps when she tells him to. They've talked about it, but he doesn't change. She tried leaving the baby in his room and went to the gas station, came back to find the baby crying and he wasn't helping. She took a video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities. She's been trying to address this for a while, and he's not changing. She's at her breaking point. Her action of sending the video to his mom was to get him to take responsibility, right? But she's worried about tattling. \n\nOn one hand, involving family can be seen as crossing a line. People might think that it's their own issue to resolve, and bringing in the mother could be seen as undermining their relationship. However, the mother's role sometimes is to support the child in such family matters. Also, the boyfriend wasn't taking care of the baby, which is a critical issue. The baby's well-being is at stake. \n\nShe did try multiple times to talk to him and he didn't change. The video was a last resort to make his mother aware, leading to his mother reaming him out. That worked, but now he's angry. So, was her action wrong? \n\nIf the mother is supportive and involved, maybe it's okay to reach out. But if she's not supposed to interfere, then maybe she overstepped. The key here is that the mother's involvement led to the boyfriend being reprimanded, which might have been necessary for the baby's care. \n\nBut from a relationship standpoint, using the mother as an intervention without discussing it with the boyfriend first could be a problem. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting a baby\u2014it's a serious matter. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the mother's well-being and the baby's safety are critical. The boyfriend's neglect is a significant issue, and involving the mother might have been necessary to address it. The author was at her wits' end, and her action was a last-ditch effort to get help. While it's not ideal to involve family without discussing, the circumstances justify it. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
