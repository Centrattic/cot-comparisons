He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together 5 years, has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, preferring to play games. The mother sent a video to his mom after he ignored the baby, leading to conflict. Now she's considering divorce but is asking if she's at fault.\n\nThe key points here: the man's refusal to help with childcare, the mother's attempts to communicate which didn't work, and her action of involving his mother with evidence. The question is whether her action was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the main issue is the father's neglect. If a parent isn't taking care of their child, that's a serious problem. The mother is trying to make him take responsibility. However, involving the mother-in-law can be sensitive. But in this case, the mother had a valid reason\u2014her partner wasn't fulfilling his duties, and she documented it. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms or family dynamics. But since the father's actions are harmful, using evidence to hold him accountable isn't necessarily wrong. The mother is in a stressful situation, and her actions were to ensure the child's well-being. Even though involving family can be tricky, the intent here seems justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
