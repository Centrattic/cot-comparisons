He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend isn't helping with their baby daughter, refuses to take care of her, plays video games instead, and when he does help, it's only when the author is available. They've talked about it multiple times, and the boyfriend improves briefly but then goes back. The author tried to leave the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she came back, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of involvement in parenting. The author is clearly stressed and overburdened. She's trying to get her partner to take responsibility, which is a valid expectation in a parenting partnership. The boyfriend's behavior seems negligent, and the author feels desperate.\n\nNow, the action in question is sending the video to the boyfriend's mother. Tattling is often seen as wrong, but in this case, the mother called him out, which led to the boyfriend being upset. The author's intention here was to get the mother to intervene, which worked. But did she overstep?\n\nOn one hand, involving the mother might be seen as bypassing the boyfriend directly. The author had already discussed the issue multiple times with him, so maybe she felt it was necessary to get another family member involved to make a change. On the other hand, sending a video could be seen as an invasion of privacy or using emotional leverage against the boyfriend, which could be considered manipulative.\n\nBut then, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning regarding child neglect. The author is trying to protect her child and herself by ensuring the father takes responsibility. If the boyfriend's actions were truly neglectful, then involving the mother might be a valid step to protect the child. However, since the author might be in a committed relationship, maybe she should have tried more direct methods first, like couples counseling or mediation, before involving the mother. But given that she's tried multiple times and the boyfriend isn't improving, her options might be limited.\n\nThe key factors here are the boyfriend's neglect, the author's desperation, and the justification for involving the mother. If the boyfriend's actions are truly neglectful, then the author's action could be seen as justified to protect the child. However, if the mother was not previously aware of the situation, the author might have a duty to inform her if the child is in danger. On the flip side, if the author's method of involving the mother was through a private video without consent, that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of morality, the line between justified action and tattling depends on intent and context. If the author's intent was to protect the child, then it's more understandable. But if it's to manipulate the boyfriend by using his mother, it's a different story. Given the description, the author's primary concern is the child's well-being and her own mental health, so her actions might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by concern for her child and the need to address a persistent issue that wasn't resolved through direct communication. Involving a parent might be a necessary step when other methods fail, especially in cases of potential neglect.\n"
