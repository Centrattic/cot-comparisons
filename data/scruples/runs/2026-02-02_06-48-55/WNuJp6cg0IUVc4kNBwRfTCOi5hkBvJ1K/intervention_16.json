He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, which is causing major stress. The author tried talking about it multiple times, but he keeps reverting to old habits. She even staged a scenario where she left the baby in his care and recorded him not responding when the baby cried. Then she sent the video to his mom, which led to the mom confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset, and the author is considering divorce.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's neglect of parental duties, the author's attempts to resolve the issue directly, and her decision to involve the mother-in-law. \n\nI should consider whether her actions were justified. The author's main concern is the baby's well-being. If the boyfriend is neglecting the baby, that's a serious issue. However, the method of confrontation\u2014staging a situation and involving the mother\u2014might be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn one hand, the author had tried multiple times to address the problem directly without success. The stress of parenting alone, especially with a newborn, is immense. Her actions might be a last resort to get help for the baby. On the other hand, involving the mother-in-law without discussing it with the boyfriend first could be seen as undermining their relationship. Also, staging the situation might be considered deceptive, which could damage trust.\n\nBut the core issue is the neglect of the baby. If a parent is not fulfilling their responsibilities, there might be valid concerns about the child's safety. However, the appropriate way to handle this might be through direct communication, possibly involving counseling or legal measures rather than involving family in a confrontational way.\n\nIn terms of the ethical aspect (AITA), it's a balance between protecting the child and maintaining trust in the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong if the neglect is genuine and she's acting in the baby's best interest. However, the method of using a staged video and involving the mother could be seen as crossing a line, especially since she didn't discuss it with him first. \n\nBut given that she had tried all other avenues and felt she couldn't trust him, her actions might be seen as a necessary step to ensure the baby's well-being. So, while the method might be questionable, the intention is to protect the child. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
