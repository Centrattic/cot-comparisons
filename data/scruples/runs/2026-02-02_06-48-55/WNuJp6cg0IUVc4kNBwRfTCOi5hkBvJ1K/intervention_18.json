He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. He's not helping with the baby, even after multiple discussions. The author feels overwhelmed and has tried to communicate the problem but hasn't seen lasting changes. She put the baby in his room and left, then recorded a video when he ignored the baby. She sent this to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. Sending the video to his mother could be seen as involving family in their personal issues without the boyfriend's consent. It might be a breach of trust if they agreed not to involve family. However, the boyfriend's behavior is harmful to the child and their relationship. The author is in a vulnerable position, caring for a newborn alone, which is stressful and could justify her actions as a last resort to get help.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother could escalate the situation and might not be the best approach. The boyfriend might feel that his privacy was invaded by the video, even if the intent was to show neglect. There's a balance between protecting the child and respecting the partner's autonomy.\n\nBut considering the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting a crying baby\u2014some might argue that the author's actions were justified to highlight the problem and get support. However, using a video might be seen as manipulative or exaggerated, depending on context. The key is whether the video accurately represents the situation or if it was taken out of context as the boyfriend claims.\n\nIn summary, while the boyfriend's neglect is serious, the author's method of addressing it by involving his mother might be considered a breach of trust. However, the underlying issue is significant. The answer could hinge on whether the video was a fair representation and if there were other options tried. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be A (yes) because she bypassed direct communication and used a video, which could be seen as manipulative. But others might say B (no) because the neglect is a critical issue. The user initially thought A, but the answer might depend on the cultural or personal ethics involved.\n"
