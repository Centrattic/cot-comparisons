He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they have a 6-month-old daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games a lot, only helps when she tells him, and there's a pattern of neglect. She's tried talking about it multiple times, and he improves temporarily but then goes back to his old ways. She's considering divorce and made a move where she left the baby in his room, went to a gas station, and when she came back, the baby was screaming and he wasn't helping. She recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014he's not fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious matter. The parent (author) is struggling and has tried to communicate, but it's not working. The act of sending the video to his mother is the key point here. \n\nOn one hand, involving his mother might be seen as crossing a boundary. Usually, parents don't like their adult children's partners reporting them to other family members. It could be seen as undermining the couple's ability to resolve issues on their own. But on the other hand, the situation involves the well-being of a child. If the father is neglecting the baby, the mother might feel desperate and justified in seeking help from the grandfather or grandmother, especially if her own attempts to address the issue have failed. \n\nThe video itself is 10 seconds, which might be a short clip but could show the neglect. However, taking a video without the boyfriend's knowledge might be seen as deceptive. But given the context, she might have felt it was necessary to document the problem, especially if she's planning to involve others or take legal action.\n\nAnother angle is the method she used. Instead of confronting him directly or seeking professional help like counseling, she involved his mother. This could strain family relationships and might not be the best approach. But considering the stress and exhaustion she's under, maybe she felt it was the only option left. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context. But if the clip accurately shows him neglecting the baby, then the context is clear. The mother's intention was to make him take responsibility. \n\nBalancing these factors: while involving his mother isn't typical, the severity of the neglect (a baby's needs being ignored) might justify it. The author is in a tough spot, trying to protect her child and her own well-being. The boyfriend's inaction is a major issue, and the mother's actions could be seen as a last resort. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might say yes because she bypassed direct communication and involved family. Others might say no because the neglect is serious and she's acting in her child's best interest. Given the circumstances, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the neglect is significant and she's trying to hold the father accountable, even if the method was unconventional.\n"
