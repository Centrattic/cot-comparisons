He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're in a relationship with their boyfriend, they have a baby, and he's not helping with childcare. The author is frustrated because he plays games instead of taking care of the baby. They've talked about it, but he keeps reverting to his old behavior. Then, in a moment of desperation, the author puts the baby in his gaming room, pretends to leave, goes to the gas station, and records a video of him ignoring the baby. They send it to his mom, which leads to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their boyfriend's lack of involvement with their daughter. This is a valid concern because parenting requires teamwork, and one parent shouldn't bear all the burden. The boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful, which is a serious issue. \n\nBut then the author decides to \"tattle\" by sending the video to his mom. The key here is the method they used. They lied about leaving to get the reaction, recorded the video, and involved the mother. This could be seen as deceptive because they didn't confront the boyfriend directly with the evidence but instead went to his mom. The boyfriend might feel that this was a breach of trust, especially since they fabricated a scenario to catch him in the act. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly at the end of their rope. They've tried multiple times to address the issue and are considering divorce. The video was a last-ditch effort to force a change by involving his mother, who had the reaction they hoped for. But using deception to get evidence, even with good intentions, might be ethically questionable. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother stepping in and reaming him out could have been effective, but the author's actions might have damaged their relationship further. The boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and feeling like the video was taken out of context. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe the author should have sought counseling or legal advice instead of involving the mother. But given the circumstances, the author's actions come from a place of desperation and trying to protect their child. However, the method involved deception and involving family without the boyfriend's knowledge, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had a legitimate reason to be frustrated, but their approach might have been inappropriate. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because of the deceptive tactics used, or B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to address neglect. \n\nI need to consider if the act of tattling is wrong. In some contexts, it's seen as a betrayal, but in others, it's a necessary step to protect a child. The line is blurry. Since the boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, the author's intent was to help, but the means might be questionable. Maybe the answer is A because of the deception and going behind his back, but if the neglect is serious, it's also B. \n\nHmm. Given that the author is considering divorce and the situation is severe, maybe their actions are understandable, making the answer B. But the method of deception and using the mother's authority might be seen as wrong. I'm leaning towards A, but not sure. \n\nWait, another angle: The author's actions could be seen as justified if the neglect is severe and the mother's reaction is positive. However, the deception involved (pretending to leave) could be a problem. But in high-stress situations, people might do things they wouldn't otherwise. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The neglect is serious, so using a video to show the mother is a way to get help. However, involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent is a breach of trust. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't address it directly first. But they did try multiple times. \n\nOverall, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the underlying issue is significant, and the author's intent was to protect their child and address neglect. Even if the method was questionable, the intent was good. Or is the method the problem? \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because they used manipulation (pretending to leave) to get the video. That's a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author's actions involved deception and went behind the boyfriend's back, which is considered wrong even if the intent was good. So, the author is at fault for the method used, even if the issue is valid. So the answer would be A.\n"
