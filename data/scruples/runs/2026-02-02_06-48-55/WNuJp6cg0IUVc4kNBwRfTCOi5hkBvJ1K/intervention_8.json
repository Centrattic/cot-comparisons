He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother about him neglecting their baby. The author and her boyfriend have been together five years, and since the daughter was born six months ago, things have gotten bad. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, plays video games instead, and only helps when the author tells him to. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and then sent a video to his mom after he ignored the baby. The boyfriend is now upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful, which is serious because it's about child care. The author is clearly stressed and has tried talking to him multiple times without success. Her action of sending the video to the mother might be seen as a last resort. However, going to his mother might not be the best approach, as it could be seen as crossing a boundary by involving family without his consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is not fulfilling his parental duties, which is a major issue. The author is in a stressful situation, possibly with postpartum issues, and is trying to protect her child. Sending the video as evidence might be a way to get help when other methods failed. The boyfriend being upset about the mother's reaction could be valid if the video was taken without consent, but the context is that the baby was being neglected. \n\nThe key factors here are the well-being of the child and the appropriateness of the author's actions. While involving the mother might not be ideal, the primary concern is the child's safety and care. The author's actions might be justified if the boyfriend is truly neglecting the child. However, there's a balance between protecting the child and respecting the boyfriend's autonomy. \n\nI think the answer depends on the severity of the neglect. If the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely harmful, the author's actions are in the child's best interest. But if the video was taken without a clear understanding of the situation, maybe there's a context issue. Since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, tattling might have a negative connotation, but when it comes to child neglect, it's a different scenario. The author might be acting out of desperation. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the child's welfare is the priority, and the author tried other methods first. However, the method of involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent might be ethically questionable, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
