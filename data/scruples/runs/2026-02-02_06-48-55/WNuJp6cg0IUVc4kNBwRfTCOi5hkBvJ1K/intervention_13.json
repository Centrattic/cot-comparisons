He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing a lot of stress for the author. She's been trying to talk to him, even threatening to leave, and finally took a video to send to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's actions. If he's not helping with the baby, especially when the baby is crying, that's a big issue. New parents need support, and if one parent isn't contributing, it can lead to a lot of strain. The author has tried talking multiple times, even to the point of threatening to leave, but there's no change. That suggests that maybe the boyfriend isn't responsive to direct communication.\n\nThen there's the act of sending the video to his mother. On one hand, involving a parent in a marital issue isn't typical. It might be seen as crossing a boundary. But on the other hand, the author is clearly desperate. She's tried everything else and felt that she couldn't trust her partner. The situation might be so dire that she felt she had no other options. However, taking a video secretly could be problematic. Even though the baby was crying and the boyfriend was ignoring it, the act of recording without his consent could be an issue, depending on the laws in their area. Also, using a parent to confront him might not be the best approach for resolving their conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's upset because he feels the video was out of context. Maybe he had a reason for not getting the baby that moment, or maybe he was in the middle of something. Without context, the video could be misleading. But then again, if the baby was crying and he was ignoring it, that's a serious matter. The author might feel that the video was the only proof needed to show his neglect.\n\nI need to weigh the boyfriend's neglect against the author's decision to involve his mother. While the author's actions might be seen as overstepping, the underlying issue of his not helping with the baby is a significant problem. Divorce is a big step, and the author seems to be at her breaking point. But in terms of right or wrong, the act of sending the video without his knowledge and to his mother could be considered crossing a line, even if done out of desperation. However, the neglect of a child is a serious matter, and the author might have felt she had no other way to make him take responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. She did try to handle it herself first, but the method of involving his mother and using a video might be seen as inappropriate. But the context of his behavior being harmful to the baby complicates things. Maybe there's a middle ground here, like involving a professional or seeking counseling. However, given the options, the author's actions, while perhaps unorthodox, might be understandable given the circumstances. But legally and ethically, involving a parent without discussing it first is a problem. Still, the neglect aspect is serious. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the boyfriend's actions are worse, but the method might be questionable. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not if he is. If the focus is on her actions, maybe it's a yes. But if the focus is on the overall situation, maybe not. Hmm.\n"
