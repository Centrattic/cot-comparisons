He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter, and the author tried to convince him by pretending to leave and then sending a video to his mom when he didn't pick up the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple is married, five years together, and the breakdown started after the baby. The boyfriend isn't taking any initiative in caring for the baby, only responding when told, and even then, he questions why she can't handle it. The author tried to talk to him, but he only improves for a week before reverting. She's considering divorce but sent a video to his mom as a last resort. Now, he's upset because she involved his mother and took the video out of context.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did the wrong thing by using this method. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The answer should be A or B. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to get help from his mother to make him take responsibility. But involving his mother in a private family matter, especially through a video, could be seen as crossing boundaries. However, the alternative is that the author is overwhelmed and the father isn't helping, which is a serious issue for a newborn's well-being.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action might be seen as manipulative. She pretended to leave to provoke a reaction, then captured evidence. Sending it to his mom without his consent could be invasive. On the other hand, if the father is neglecting the child, the author has a responsibility to ensure the baby's safety and well-being. His mother might be a support system he's close to, and this could be a way to communicate the problem without direct confrontation.\n\nBut the problem is how she approached it. Instead of addressing the issue with him first or seeking couples counseling, she took a step that involved his mother. It's possible that the boyfriend feels betrayed because she went to his mother without his knowledge. The mother's reaction (reaming him) might have made him defensive, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was justified. In some cultures, involving in-laws might be common, but in others, it's considered a breach of privacy. The author is in a stressful situation, and the father's behavior is harmful. However, the method of using a video as a \"gotcha\" could be seen as underhanded. The right approach would be to have an honest conversation, seek professional help, or involve other family members if necessary, but doing so secretly could damage trust.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the justification and the method. If the author is in the right, it's because the child's welfare is at stake. If she's in the wrong, it's because she handled it secretly and through the mother, which might not be the best approach. The community often looks at such situations from the perspective of intent and the well-being of the child. Even though the method was questionable, the intent was to protect the child. However, the act of tattling and using a video might be seen as manipulative. \n\nI think the answer is A, but the reasoning is important. The author's action could be seen as crossing a line by using a deceptive tactic and involving the mother, but the underlying issue is serious. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the effectiveness. Since the method was manipulative and without consent, the answer is A.\n"
