He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him neglecting their baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing a lot of stress for the author. She's tried talking to him multiple times, and even after he temporarily improves, he goes back to neglecting their child. This is a serious issue because the baby's well-being is at stake. The mother is clearly overwhelmed and frustrated.\n\nNow, the author's action was to send a video to his mother as a last resort. She did this after he failed to respond to her previous attempts to communicate. From her perspective, she might feel like she's out of options and needs to involve family to make him take responsibility. However, involving the mother without discussing it with the boyfriend first could be seen as crossing a boundary. Relationships usually have boundaries about how and when to involve family, especially in such sensitive matters.\n\nBut then again, the situation is about the baby's care. If the boyfriend is consistently neglecting the child, there might be a valid concern about the child's safety and well-being. In such cases, some people might argue that the mother has a duty to act in the child's best interest, even if it means bypassing her partner. However, the method of involving the mother without prior discussion could be problematic. It might have been better to seek other avenues, like counseling or contacting child protective services, before involving his mother directly. \n\nThe boyfriend feels wronged because she presented the video without context and involved his mother. That's a valid point too. He might feel betrayed or that she's undermining his parenting abilities in front of his family. On the other hand, the mother might see the video as evidence of his neglect.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, she's acting out of desperation to protect her child. On the other, she didn't communicate her intentions to her partner first, which could damage their relationship. The key factors are the well-being of the child versus the breach of trust in the relationship. If the neglect is severe enough, her actions might be justified. But if there were other steps she could have taken without involving his mother, maybe she's at fault. The answer hinges on the severity of the neglect and the appropriateness of her actions. I'm leaning towards her being in the wrong because bypassing the partner and involving the mother without a discussion might have been a hasty decision, though her intentions are understandable.\n"
