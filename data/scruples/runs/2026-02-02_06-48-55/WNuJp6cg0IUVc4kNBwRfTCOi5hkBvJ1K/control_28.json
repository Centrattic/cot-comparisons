He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, and since the baby was born six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, only helps when told, and even then, he questions why she doesn't do it. She's had multiple conversations with him, and he temporarily improves but then goes back. She tried leaving the house to check on him, took a video, and sent it to his mom. His mom confronted him, he's upset with her for involving his mom and the context of the video.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the boyfriend's behavior towards the baby, the mother's response, and the author's actions. \n\nThe boyfriend is clearly not fulfilling his parental responsibilities. The author is the primary caregiver, which is taking a toll on her. She tried multiple times to address the issue, and he isn't making a consistent effort. Her decision to use a video to show his mother is a last resort because he's not changing despite her efforts. \n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother-in-law can be a sensitive issue. Some might argue that she should have handled it within the relationship first. However, given the circumstances where the boyfriend isn't changing, maybe involving the mother was necessary to get through to him. \n\nThe video was 10 seconds, and she sent it with an explanation. The mother called him out, which worked in making him aware. The boyfriend is upset with her for tattling, but his actions are the root problem. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Arguably not, because the core issue is his neglect. She tried all possible steps. The video was a factual capture of his behavior. However, involving the mother might have been a line she shouldn't have crossed. But given the severity of the neglect, maybe it's justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The boyfriend's actions are the main problem. The author's actions were to seek help when all else failed. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
