He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author sent a video of him ignoring the baby to his mom. The boyfriend is upset because she involved his mother and took the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together for 5 years, and their relationship has deteriorated since the baby was born six months ago. The boyfriend refuses to care for the baby, only helps when she's screaming, and doesn't hold her unless it's under specific circumstances. The author tried talking about it multiple times, and even when the boyfriend improves briefly, he goes back to old ways. She considered divorce but did a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving. When she came back, the baby was crying, and he was ignoring it. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to the boyfriend's anger.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending the video to his mother. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The author is dealing with a significant issue: her partner isn't fulfilling his parental duties. They've tried communication, but it hasn't worked. Sending a video to his mother could be seen as tattling or trying to get her to change his behavior through third-party intervention. On the one hand, she's trying to address a real problem that affects their child's well-being. On the other, involving his mother might be a breach of privacy and could cause family tension. \n\nBut is it really in the wrong? The boyfriend is a parent, and the child's needs aren't being met. If the mother is a significant figure in his life, maybe the author felt that was the only way to make him take responsibility. However, sending the video without his consent might be crossing a line. He might feel that it's an invasion of privacy and that she's not handling the issue between them. The fact that he improved for a week suggests there's potential for change, but maybe she's losing patience. \n\nThe ambiguity here is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The video was 10 seconds, so it's a short clip, but taking a video without consent could be problematic. Also, involving the mother might not be the best approach. Typically, couples are encouraged to handle such issues themselves first, unless there's a child safety concern. If the baby's well-being is at risk, maybe the author is justified. But if it's more about the stress on the relationship, then involving the mother might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the user says they've talked about it multiple times, and the boyfriend isn't consistent. The author's actions might stem from desperation. However, the method of tattling and using a video could be seen as manipulative or a lack of trust. The boyfriend might feel that she's not respecting his family or that she's using guilt tactics. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intent and the method. The intent was to help, but the method involved a third party. If the mother is someone who's active in his life and can influence him, maybe it's a last resort. But generally, sending a video to a parent without the other partner's knowledge could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the alternative is the baby not being cared for. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and the couple's dynamics. If the author felt that the child's safety was in jeopardy, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if it's about stress and the boyfriend's unwillingness to help, then using his mother might be crossing a line. The author might be in the right in terms of wanting the baby to be cared for, but the method is questionable. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes, B for no. The user thinks A, but I need to decide. If the action was a necessary step to ensure the baby's well-being, then maybe B. But if it's a breach of trust and privacy, then A. The situation is complex, but since the boyfriend is the parent and the child's needs are unmet, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way she did it, without direct communication or maybe trying other avenues first, could be seen as wrong. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The baby's welfare is a priority, but the method of involving the mother might not be the best approach. However, the boyfriend was already unresponsive to direct communication. In such cases, some might argue that she's justified. Others might say she should handle it within the relationship. Since the user is asking from a moral standpoint, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong because the baby's care is at stake. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is A because it's involving a parent, which can be seen as tattling. Hmm. I need to make a choice here.\n"
