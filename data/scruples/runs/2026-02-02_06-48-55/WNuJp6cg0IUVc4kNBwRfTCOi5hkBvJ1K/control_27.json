He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend not taking care of their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has a 6-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and only holds her when calm. They've talked about it multiple times, and he briefly improves but then goes back to the same behavior. The author is considering divorce but tried a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving for a gas station. When she came back, the baby was crying and he was ignoring it. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for doing that? \n\nThe user wants a yes (A) or no (B). Let's break it down. The key points here are about taking action to get help for the child and the method used. The author is in a stressful situation with a partner who isn't fulfilling his parental duties, leading to exhaustion and possible neglect. She tried communication, which didn't work, so she escalated by involving his mother. \n\nOn one hand, involving the mother might be seen as crossing a boundary if the couple was supposed to handle it themselves. But on the other hand, the baby's well-being is at stake. The video was a short clip to show the issue, which the mother used to confront him. The boyfriend is upset because it's his mom, but the author's main concern was the child's welfare. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the mother-in-law might have been the only person to influence the boyfriend to change. The author's action could be justified as a last resort to protect the child. However, some might argue that she should have handled it differently, like through legal means or a counselor, rather than involving family. But given the context of repeated failures in communication and the immediate danger to the child's well-being, her action might be seen as necessary. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the primary responsibility is to the child's safety, and she took a step to address neglect. However, others might argue that she overstepped by involving the mother. But since the boyfriend's behavior was harmful, the author's action was a protective measure. So leaning towards B.\n"
