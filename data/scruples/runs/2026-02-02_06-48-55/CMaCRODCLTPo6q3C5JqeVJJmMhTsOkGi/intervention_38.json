Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The author had to remind her multiple times to stop holding her belly to avoid making it obvious. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author is trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they paid for a wedding photoshoot and wanted the focus on the wedding itself, not maternity photos. They had to correct Kate's posing because her intention was to highlight her belly, which might have been distracting from the main event. The author could be seen as prioritizing the overall event's aesthetics over Kate's personal desire to showcase her pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate is a bridesmaid, and expecting her to pose like everyone else might not account for her current condition. Pregnancy can affect how someone stands or poses, and maybe she was trying to be genuine. If the author didn't communicate their expectations beforehand, it's possible that Kate wasn't aware of the author's preferences. However, the author did ask her to stop, so they had the opportunity to clarify their wishes.\n\nIt's also important to think about the dynamics of the relationship. Kate might feel that her body and her pregnancy are being policed, especially in a public event like a wedding. The author's insistence could be perceived as insensitive, even if their intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding. But if the author had explained that they wanted a cohesive look for the wedding party without individual features standing out, that might have been different.\n\nAnother angle is the professional photoshoot cost. The author invested money into the photos and might be concerned about how the final product looks. If Kate's posing was making her look different, the author might be trying to maintain a consistent aesthetic. However, respecting her pregnancy and her comfort should also be considered.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, sometimes people in larger groups or events might have preferences about how photos are taken. If the author was clear about wanting a unified look, Kate's actions could be seen as disregarding that. But if the author didn't set expectations beforehand, maybe it's a miscommunication.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is now upset and the author feels like they're being avoided adds to the tension. The author might need to consider if their actions were justified or if they could have handled it more sensitively. Maybe instead of repeatedly asking her to stop, they could have had a private conversation to explain their perspective without making Kate feel criticized.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to have a wedding photoshoot, so they have a valid point. But Kate's feelings about her body and pregnancy are also important. If the author approached it with sensitivity and respect, maybe there's room for both perspectives. However, since the author did correct her and it led to hurt feelings, it's possible that the author didn't handle it in the most considerate way. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not finding a compromise or explaining their reasoning better.\n"
