Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was the bride, and one of the bridesmaids, Kate, was pregnant. The bride asked Kate not to hold her belly in the photos, which Kate took as being told to hide her pregnancy. The bride's reasoning is that she wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not on Kate's maternity. Now, Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid says Kate is mad because the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nSo, to determine if the bride is in the wrong, I need to consider several factors. \n\n1. **Intent vs. Perception**: The bride's intent was to have the wedding photos look good and focused on the event, not maternity shots. However, her request was perceived by Kate as being critical of her body. The key here is whether the bride's request was reasonable and how it was communicated. If the bride simply asked Kate to pose naturally without emphasizing her belly, that's a common request in group photos to maintain a uniform look. But if the tone or method was harsh, that could be an issue.\n\n2. **Communication Style**: The bride had to remind Kate multiple times. How did she phrase her requests? If she was polite and explained that the focus was on the wedding, it's more understandable. If she was dismissive or rude, that could be problematic. The description here doesn't mention the tone, so we have to assume it was just repeated reminders without context.\n\n3. **Kate's Reaction**: The fact that Kate is upset and hasn't communicated since the wedding might indicate she felt embarrassed or disrespected. The other bridesmaid's comment that Kate feels the bride was trying to hide her pregnancy adds to that. However, the bride's perspective is about the photos being a professional shoot for the wedding, not maternity, which is a valid concern. The bride probably wanted the photos to look cohesive and not have one person standing out in a way that shifts focus.\n\n4. **Expectations and Social Norms**: It's common in weddings for photos to be coordinated, and people are usually expected to dress and pose in a way that fits the event's theme. Asking someone to avoid a specific pose that might draw attention is a standard part of photo sessions. However, pregnancy is a natural part of life, and the bridesmaid might feel that showing her pregnancy is important to her. The conflict arises from differing expectations.\n\n5. **Financial Aspect**: The bride mentions paying for the photoshoot, so she might feel entitled to have the photos reflect the wedding's theme. However, this doesn't automatically mean she's right in her approach. It's about balancing the bride's wishes with the comfort of the attendees.\n\nConsidering all this, the bride's main issue was not considering how her request affected Kate. While the bride has a right to have the photos focus on the wedding, the fact that Kate felt her pregnancy was being hidden (even if that's not the intent) could mean the bride didn't handle it sensitively. The bride's request, while understandable from a photo perspective, might have overlooked Kate's feelings about her body and the significance of showing her pregnancy. \n\nHowever, the bride's action was within her rights as the one paying for the photos. The problem might be more about communication and empathy. The bride could have had a conversation with Kate beforehand about the photo style, perhaps suggesting a different pose or dress that both accommodates the pregnancy and the photo needs. But since the bride did ask politely and Kate still insisted, maybe the bride was within her rights to enforce the pose for the photos.\n\nIn the end, the question is whether the bride was wrong. If she didn't have any malicious intent and was just trying to maintain the aesthetic of the photos, she's not inherently wrong. However, the impact on Kate's feelings might mean she could have handled it better. But according to the question, we need to decide if she's in the wrong, not if she could have been more sensitive. \n\nGiven that the bride's actions were to maintain the focus of the wedding photos and not to hide Kate's pregnancy (as per the bride's perspective), the answer is likely B (the bride is not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here where the bride might have been less considerate, but based on the information given, the bride's actions don't cross into being in the wrong. The key is that the bride's request was about the photos, not about Kate's body. So, the answer is B.\n"
