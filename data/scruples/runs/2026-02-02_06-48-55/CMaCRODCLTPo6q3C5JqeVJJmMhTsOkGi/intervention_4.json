Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is the bride who paid for the wedding photos. Kate was holding her belly to show it off, which the author asked her to stop doing. The author's reasoning is that it's a wedding photo, not a maternity shoot. Kate is upset about this, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The other bridesmaid confirmed Kate's feelings.\n\nNow, considering the roles here. The bride has the right to decide how the photos look, especially since she's paying for the professional shoot. The wedding photos are supposed to focus on the couple and their wedding day, not individual features of the guests. However, Kate was pregnant, which is a natural body condition. The bride's request might be seen as insensitive if she's dismissing Kate's pregnancy, but it's also about the overall aesthetic of the wedding photos.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? If Kate was making a deliberate effort to show her belly, which the bride didn't want in the pictures, the bride's request is about maintaining the intended look. On the other hand, if Kate was just naturally showing her belly because of her pregnancy, asking her to hide it might be seen as rude. But in this case, the user mentions that Kate was \"deliberately holding\" her belly, which suggests she was doing it intentionally to show off. So the bride's request is about maintaining the photos' focus, not about Kate's natural appearance.\n\nKate might feel hurt if she thought the bride was trying to hide her pregnancy, but the bride's reasoning is about the photos' purpose. The bride might not be in the wrong here. However, handling it politely is important. Maybe the bride could have considered a compromise, like allowing some photos where Kate could show her belly if it fit the composition. But since the bride ultimately has the final say on her wedding photos, she isn't necessarily wrong for asking Kate to adjust her pose.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The bride has the right to direct how the wedding photos look, especially when she's paying for it. Kate's deliberate action to show off her belly might be seen as not respecting the bride's vision. The bride's request is about the photos, not about Kate's body, so she's justified in asking her to adjust.\n"
