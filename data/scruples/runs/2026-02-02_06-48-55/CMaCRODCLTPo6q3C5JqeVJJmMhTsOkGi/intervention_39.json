      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a bride who had their wedding a few weeks ago. One of their bridesmaids, Kate, was 7 months pregnant. The dress had a flowy skirt that could accommodate the belly. During the wedding photos, the author noticed that Kate was holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos. The author asked her to stop holding it and to pose like everyone else, and had to remind her multiple times. After the wedding, Kate didn't respond to messages, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset that the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspective of the author. They paid a lot of money for professional wedding photos, and they wanted the photos to focus on the wedding party and the wedding itself, not on maternity shots. The author felt that Kate was intentionally showing off her belly in a way that might distract from the main event. So the author intervened to keep the photos consistent with the rest of the wedding party's poses.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that she was being asked to hide her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her body and a significant life event. She might have wanted to include her pregnancy in the photos as a way to celebrate it, especially since she was a bridesmaid and perhaps felt it was appropriate. The author's repeated reminders could be seen as dismissive of Kate's feelings or her situation, making her feel like her pregnancy was something to be hidden.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Weddings are personal events, and the bride usually has the final say in how photos are taken. However, there's also the aspect of respecting the bridesmaid's feelings. If the bride didn't want the pregnancy to be the focus, that's her choice, but the way she handled it might have been harsh. The author might have approached it differently, like discussing with Kate beforehand what the style of the photos would be, rather than correcting her during the shoot. That could have avoided hurt feelings.\n\nAnother angle: Was Kate's action of showing her belly inconsiderate? Maybe not. She was within her rights to want to showcase something important to her. The author might not have considered that Kate was trying to celebrate her pregnancy in a public event. However, the author also had the right to maintain the aesthetic of the wedding photos as they envisioned.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It might depend on communication. If the author had discussed the photo style with the bridesmaids in advance, there wouldn't be an issue. Since the author didn't mention that, and instead corrected Kate during the shoot, maybe the author could have handled it better. However, the author's intention was to have wedding photos, not maternity shots, so their actions were based on their own priorities. \n\nBut the fact that Kate felt it was a personal slight, and the author had to remind her multiple times, might indicate that the author was dismissive of Kate's feelings. The author could have compromised, like allowing the belly to be visible but in a way that still fit the overall photo theme. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had the right to set the tone for their wedding photos, the way they handled the situation might have been inconsiderate. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have been more empathetic. However, since the question is a binary choice between A and B, I need to decide if A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given that the author acted based on their own priorities and the context of a wedding they paid for, but also failed to communicate beforehand, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But the social aspect and the bridesmaid's feelings complicate it. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's feelings. Hmm. It's a tricky one. I think the key point is that the author's actions were based on their own preferences, but the way they enforced it might have been rude. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author made a choice based on their own priorities for their wedding, and the situation is about their own event, they might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that they should have been more accommodating. Given that the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but the answer could be nuanced, but in the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person was inconsiderate. If the author's intention was to have wedding photos and not maternity ones, and they weren't being malicious, maybe they aren't the asshole. However, if their actions were unkind or dismissive, they might be. The fact that Kate felt hurt and the author didn't consider her feelings beforehand could tip it towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm still not sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's the bride's event and they have the right to decide the photo style. Alternatively, maybe A, because they could have handled it with more sensitivity. I think in the AITA context, the community often sides with the person who had the right intention (the bride's) but might still find them somewhat in the wrong for not handling it better. However, since the author's actions were not malicious and were about their own event, the answer is likely B.\n"
