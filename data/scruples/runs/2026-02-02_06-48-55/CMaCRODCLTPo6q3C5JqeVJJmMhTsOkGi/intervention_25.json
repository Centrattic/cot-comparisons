Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) was in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author paid for a wedding photo shoot, and Kate was being obvious with her belly in the photos. The author asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset. The other bridesmaid says Kate is mad because the author was \"trying to make her look fat, not pregnant.\" The author feels like the photoshoot is for the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nHmm. So, the author's main point is about controlling the photoshoot for their wedding. Kate might feel her pregnancy was being downplayed. But the author paid for the shoot to focus on the wedding, not maternity. However, is it polite to tell someone not to show their pregnancy in photos? \n\nOn one hand, Kate is pregnant, and she might want to share that part of her life. But the author is the one paying for the photos, and they might not want the focus to be on Kate's pregnancy during their wedding. But is it rude to ask someone to not show their belly in photos? It's a bit of a personal choice. The author didn't forbid her entirely, just asked her to stop. Maybe Kate felt her body was being controlled, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author could have considered Kate's feelings first. Maybe they could have talked about the photoshoot style beforehand instead of during the event. However, the author might not have known Kate would want to show her belly so obviously. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author had the right to tell Kate how to pose. Since Kate was a bridesmaid, the author's wedding is the main event. But Kate's pregnancy is a personal aspect. The author might not be in the wrong because they are the one paying and organizing the photoshoot. However, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is if they are in the wrong. Since they asked her to stop, and she felt it was to make her look fat, but the author's intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they are responsible for the photoshoot and the event. However, maybe they could have communicated better. But the answer is either A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. I think it's a B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to direct the photoshoot. Kate might have overstepped by being obvious, and the author corrected her. It's a sensitivity issue, but the author's main responsibility is their own wedding event.\n"
