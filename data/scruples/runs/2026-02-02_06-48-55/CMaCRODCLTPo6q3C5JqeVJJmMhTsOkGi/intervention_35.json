Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, hold her belly during the wedding photos. The author had to remind Kate multiple times to not show off her belly. The key points are the author's intent versus Kate's feelings.\n\nFirst, the author probably wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. They paid for a wedding shoot, so they might feel it's about their big day. But Kate might see her pregnancy as a natural part of her body and feel it's okay to showcase it, especially since it's visible in the dress anyway. \n\nThe author's actions could come off as dismissive of Kate's personal experience. Even if the author didn't mean to be, repeatedly asking her to stop might make Kate feel self-conscious. The fact that they stopped talking after the wedding and another bridesmaid mentioned Kate being upset adds context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to request how the photos are taken. It's their event, and they might be concerned about the aesthetics. But the line between being considerate and being controlling is thin here. Kate might have felt her autonomy was ignored. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They had a right to ask for how the photos are posed, but the way they handled it might have been insensitive. The key is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to have wedding photos, but the impact on Kate's feelings was negative. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people don't realize that others might want to celebrate their pregnancy. The author might not have considered Kate's feelings, assuming she wouldn't mind. But it's possible both have valid perspectives. \n\nI think it's a mix of both. The author isn't necessarily the asshole, but there's room for improvement in communication. Maybe they should have discussed expectations beforehand or found a balance between the wedding aesthetic and Kate's comfort. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but with the nuance that there's a lesson here about considering others' feelings.\n"
