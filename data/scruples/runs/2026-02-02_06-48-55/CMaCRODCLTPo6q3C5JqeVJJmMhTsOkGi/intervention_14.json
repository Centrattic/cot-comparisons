Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid was showing off her pregnant belly during photos, and the author told her to stop. The key points are the author's reasoning versus the bridesmaid's feelings.\n\nFirst, the author wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not a maternity shoot. They paid for professional photos, so they might have a valid point about wanting the photos to look elegant and not have other elements distracting from the main event. The author's intention was to keep the photos consistent with how everyone else posed.\n\nBut then, the bridesmaid felt upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. That's a sensitive issue. Pregnancy can be a personal matter, and the bridesmaid might have felt her body was being criticized. Maybe she wanted to show off her pregnancy as a positive thing, and the author's repeated requests came across as dismissive of that.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is about the event's purpose. Weddings are about the couple and their union. While the bridesmaid's pregnancy is a significant life event, the wedding photos are not the place to focus on it unless the couple plans it that way. The author didn't prohibit the bridesmaid from being pregnant but from emphasizing it in the photos, which is a different matter.\n\nIt's a balance between respecting the bridesmaid's feelings and maintaining the integrity of the wedding photos. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing the photo style beforehand, but the action itself could be seen as reasonable. The bridesmaid's reaction might be overreacting, but the author could have been more considerate in their approach.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The main reason is that the author is responsible for the event they paid for and has the right to set the tone for the photos. However, there's a nuance where communication could have been better to avoid hurt feelings.\n"
