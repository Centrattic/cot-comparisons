Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a bride who didn't allow her pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The bride felt that the photoshoot was for the wedding, not maternity pictures. She asked the bridesmaid to stop holding her belly to show it off, and had to remind her multiple times. Now the bridesmaid is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe bride's reasoning is that she paid for a wedding photoshoot, not maternity shots. She probably wanted the focus on the wedding party and the event itself. But the bridesmaid might feel that her pregnancy is an important part of her identity, and not being allowed to showcase it could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the bride might not have considered how her requests were coming across. Maybe she could have been more considerate in her approach. For example, she could have had a private chat with Kate before the photoshoot to explain her preference without making her feel embarrassed. Publicly correcting her multiple times might have been seen as dismissive.\n\nBut then again, the bride has the right to decide how the photos should look. It's her wedding, and she's entitled to set expectations for the photoshoot. However, the way she handled it might have been insensitive. \n\nI should consider cultural norms here. Some people might view showing off a pregnancy as a positive thing, while others might not want the photos to focus on anything else. The key issue is communication. If the bride had discussed her concerns with Kate beforehand, maybe they could have found a compromise. \n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is now avoiding the bride suggests that there's some hurt feelings. The bride's actions, even if well-intentioned, might have come across as dismissive of Kate's pregnancy. \n\nIn conclusion, while the bride isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting the photos to focus on the wedding, her method of handling the situation could be seen as lacking empathy. However, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might depend on how the bride communicated her request and whether there was a prior understanding between them.\n"
