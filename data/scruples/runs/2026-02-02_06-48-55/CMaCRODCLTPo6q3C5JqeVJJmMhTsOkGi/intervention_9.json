Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is the bride who didn't want her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to hold her belly during the wedding photos. The bride had to remind Kate a few times to pose normally. Now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The bride is confused because she paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride's perspective: she's paying for professional wedding photos, and she wants them to look good. If Kate was intentionally showing off her belly in a way that might not look as nice in the photos, the bride might feel it's her right to ask her to adjust the pose. The bride might also not want the focus to be on the pregnancy during the wedding photos, which are supposed to be about the wedding itself.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate is pregnant, and maybe she felt that the bride was being insensitive. Being asked to not show her belly could come across as trying to hide her pregnancy, which could be hurtful. Especially if Kate was proud of her pregnancy and wanted to include it in the photos. The bride's insistence might have been seen as a way to make Kate feel self-conscious about her body or her new role as a mother-to-be.\n\nNow, the question is whether the bride was wrong. It depends on the context. The bride had the right to request how the photos should look, but the way she did it might have been inconsiderate. Maybe she didn't consider Kate's feelings. If Kate was trying to be included in the photos in a way that was natural for her, the bride's repeated reminders could have been perceived as dismissive of her pregnancy. \n\nHowever, the bride could argue that she was just trying to maintain a consistent aesthetic for the wedding photos. The dress was flowy, so maybe the belly wasn't too noticeable, but Kate's hands on her belly made it more obvious. The bride might have felt that the photos should focus on the wedding, not on individual features like a pregnancy.\n\nBut considering that Kate is a bridesmaid, her role is to support the bride, and the bride has the right to direct the photos to some extent. However, the bride should also be considerate of Kate's feelings. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like discussing it privately and explaining the reasoning, rather than repeatedly asking in front of others or during the shoot.\n\nThe fact that Kate is upset and the bride didn't hear from her might indicate that the bride's approach was hurtful. The bride's main concern is the photos, but Kate might have felt that her pregnancy was being downplayed, which is a significant life event. \n\nIn summary, the bride might not be entirely in the wrong because she has the right to control the photos. However, the way she handled it could be seen as insensitive, leading Kate to feel disrespected. So there's a balance here. The bride's intention was to get good wedding photos, but the execution might have been tactless. Therefore, the answer might be a bit nuanced, but since the options are only A (wrong) or B (not wrong), I need to decide based on the main points.\n\nIf the bride was just asking for normal posing and not being malicious, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her actions were perceived as trying to hide Kate's pregnancy, then she might be. The key is whether the bride's actions were reasonable and considerate. Since the dress was already accommodating, maybe the bride's insistence was unnecessary. So I'm leaning towards A (wrong) because the bride should have been more considerate of Kate's feelings, even if her intention was about the photos.\n"
