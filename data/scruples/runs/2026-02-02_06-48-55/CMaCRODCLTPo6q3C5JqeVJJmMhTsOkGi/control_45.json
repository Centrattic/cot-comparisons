Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, hold her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author specifically mentions that Kate was about 7 months pregnant and that her dress had a flowy skirt, which should accommodate the belly. The author noticed Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The author then asked her to stop, and had to remind her multiple times. Afterward, they felt Kate was avoiding them, and another bridesmaid confirmed Kate was upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent was to have wedding photos, not maternity photos. They had to correct Kate's posing multiple times. The financial aspect of the photo shoot is also mentioned as a reason for not wanting maternity-style shots. However, Kate felt offended and upset, thinking the author was trying to hide her pregnancy.\n\nNow, considering perspectives. The author's stance is that they had a paid photo shoot for their wedding, which is a significant investment, and they wanted the photos to reflect the event as it was. They might feel it's reasonable to correct someone's pose for consistency, especially if it wasn't the focus. On the other hand, Kate might feel her body's natural state (pregnancy) is valid and that the author was being inconsiderate, possibly trying to make her feel self-conscious.\n\nBut the author's actions were direct and corrective. They didn't seem to overreact; they asked her to stop holding her belly, which is a reasonable request if the photos are supposed to be part of the wedding event. The fact that Kate's dress was designed to accommodate the belly (flowy skirt) suggests that the belly wouldn't be hidden anyway. So, maybe the author thought that showing the belly was okay as is, but Kate was intentionally trying to accentuate it, which the author wanted to prevent. \n\nHowever, the issue is whether the author was wrong in making that request. The author's right to ask for their desired outcome in the photos they paid for is a point. But Kate's feelings of being made to feel fat or unappreciated is another. The problem here is that the author might not have considered Kate's feelings, perhaps not realizing that the act of holding her belly for photos could be a way for her to celebrate her pregnancy, which the author might not have acknowledged. \n\nBut from the description, the author's actions were direct and necessary to maintain the integrity of the wedding photos. They didn't make a personal attack, just a request to pose normally. The fact that Kate took it as a personal slight and became upset might be more about her own feelings than the author's intent. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to ask for the photos as per their vision, and the conflict might stem from miscommunication rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
