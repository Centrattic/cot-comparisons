Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a wedding and paid for professional photos. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The author noticed Kate was holding her belly to show it off in the photos, and asked her to stop. They had to remind her a few times. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is confused because they wanted the photos to be about the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's intent versus Kate's perception. The author's main concern was the photos being part of the wedding, not focusing on pregnancy. They had to correct Kate multiple times, which suggests Kate was intentionally trying to show her belly. The author didn't want to highlight the pregnancy, perhaps to keep the photos focused on the wedding day.\n\nBut from Kate's perspective, she might feel her body and her pregnancy are a natural part of her identity, and being asked to hide it could be seen as disrespectful. The author's action might be viewed as prioritizing aesthetics over Kate's comfort or her right to express her body as she is. However, the author paid for the photos to capture the wedding event, not a maternity shoot, which is a valid point too. \n\nThere's also the social aspect. Bridesmaids are part of the wedding party, and their role is to support the bride. The author as the bride might have the right to direct how the photos look. However, the way the author handled it could have been more sensitive. Maybe a private conversation beforehand would have been better than publicly correcting Kate in front of the group. But the author's actions were to maintain the intended focus of the photos.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have felt that the focus was on them, the bride, and not on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. The dress was flowy, so maybe the belly wasn't an issue, but Kate's posing was. The author didn't want the photos to be about her bridesmaid's pregnancy. That's their right as the one paying for the photos.\n\nHowever, the fact that Kate is upset and feeling targeted could mean the author didn't consider Kate's feelings enough. It's a balance between personal preferences and others' feelings. The author might have been strict without considering the emotional impact, but they also have the right to how they want their photos.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author's intent was to have wedding photos, not maternity shots, which is reasonable. However, the way they handled it could have been more empathetic. But since the author explicitly asked Kate to stop, and the photos were part of the paid service for the wedding, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because they were within their rights to direct the photo shoot as they saw fit. But there's a nuance where considering the bridesmaid's feelings could have been better handled.\n"
