Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the bride) is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the bride had a professional photo shoot as part of her wedding. She noticed that one of her bridesmaids, Kate, was holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos. The bride asked her to stop, and had to remind her multiple times. Now, Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The bride is confused because she paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and expectations. The bride has every right to control how the photos look, especially since it's her wedding. She's the one who hired the photographer and is the main subject. Her request for Kate to pose like others is reasonable. However, the sensitivity around body image is important. But the context is a wedding, not a maternity shoot. The bride's preference for the photos to focus on the wedding party rather than individual features is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and wants it acknowledged. But the bride's primary concern is the overall aesthetic of the wedding photos. The bride isn't being malicious; she's just setting boundaries for the photos. The fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid confirmed it suggests that maybe the bride's approach was a bit abrupt, but her intention wasn't to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the bride isn't in the wrong. She's within her rights to decide how the photos should look. The answer should be B (No).\n"
