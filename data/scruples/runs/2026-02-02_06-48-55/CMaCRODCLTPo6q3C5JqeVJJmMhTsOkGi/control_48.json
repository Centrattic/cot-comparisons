Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. So, the situation is that Kate, a bridesmaid, was about 7 months pregnant and wore a flowy dress. The author noticed Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The author asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, think about the author's perspective. She paid a lot for the wedding photos, which were supposed to be about the wedding, not maternity shots. She probably wanted the focus to be on her wedding day, not on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. She asked Kate to stop showing off her belly, which might be seen as reasonable since it's her special day.\n\nBut from Kate's side, she might feel that her pregnancy is a part of her identity and she wanted to celebrate that. Being pregnant is a big deal, and she might have wanted to share that moment. The author's request to stop holding her belly could be perceived as dismissive of Kate's body or her pregnancy, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is the one who organized the photo shoot, so she has the right to set the tone and the focus of the photos. However, Kate might feel that her feelings were hurt because she wasn't considered. But again, the author's main priority is her wedding day. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she asked politely and made it clear that the photos were for the wedding, then maybe not. But if she was harsh or made Kate feel bad, that's different. The description says the author had to remind her a few times, but there's no indication of rudeness. So, it's more about the author asserting her right to have the wedding photos as she wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more considerate. Maybe she could have acknowledged Kate's pregnancy in a positive way while still keeping the focus on the wedding. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is intent. The author's intent was to have her wedding photos without making them about others' pregnancies. Kate's reaction is about feeling disrespected. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who chose the dress for the bridesmaids. If the dress was flowy, maybe Kate could have adjusted her posing to avoid the obvious belly, but she chose to hold it. The author had the right to ask her to stop. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because it's her wedding and she has control over the photos. The bridesmaid's feelings are valid, but the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
