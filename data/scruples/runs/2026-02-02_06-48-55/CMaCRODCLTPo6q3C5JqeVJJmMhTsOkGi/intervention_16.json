Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the wedding planner (the author) was in the wrong for not letting a bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the bride wanted the photos to focus on the wedding party, not maternity shots. She had to remind the pregnant bridesmaid (Kate) to stop holding her belly to show it off. Then, after the wedding, Kate became distant, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset the bride was trying to make her look fat.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting everyone's feelings versus the bride's right to control the photos. The bride paid for the photos, so she might have a right to decide how they look. However, Kate might feel her pregnancy was being downplayed or that her personal moment was being ignored. \n\nBut the bride's request was about maintaining the wedding photos' focus. The bride wasn't making comments about Kate's weight; she just wanted the photos to look like a traditional wedding party. The fact that Kate chose to hold her belly in a way that's common in maternity photos might have been a personal choice. The bride asking her to pose like others doesn't necessarily mean she's being cruel. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the bride could have been more considerate in her approach, acknowledging Kate's feelings while redirecting her. However, the main issue is about the bride's right to set the tone for her own wedding photos. Since the bride paid for the shoot, it's her event, and she has the final say on the photos. Kate's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than the bride being wrong. But the bride's intention was to keep the focus on the wedding, not on individual features. \n\nSo, considering all this, the bride isn't in the wrong. She was within her rights to manage the photos as she saw fit. The answer should be B.\n"
