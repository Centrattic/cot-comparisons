Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the situation is that Kate, the bridesmaid, is 7 months pregnant. The author noticed Kate was holding her belly to show it off in the photos and asked her to stop. Then Kate became upset and is now not responding, with another bridesmaid saying Kate is mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pictures. She felt that the photos should focus on the wedding, not Kate's pregnancy. But Kate and others think the author was being insensitive, trying to hide Kate's pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, pregnancy is a natural part of life, and maybe Kate felt it was important to her to show her pregnancy in the pictures. The author's request might have been seen as dismissive of Kate's experience. However, the author also has the right to decide the focus of her wedding photos. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. Instead of just telling Kate to stop, maybe she could have considered a pose that incorporated the belly without it being the main focus. Or perhaps there was a lack of communication about expectations beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask politely and reminded her, which seems reasonable. But if Kate felt her pregnancy was being hidden, that's a valid feeling. It's a balance between respecting the wedding's focus and respecting Kate's personal experience.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, it might depend on intent and how it was handled. If the author was intentionally trying to make Kate look fat, that's one thing. But she said she wanted to focus on the wedding. However, the way it came across to Kate and others is that she was being made to feel self-conscious. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but could have been more considerate. However, the key here is whether she was in the wrong. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. If she had a legitimate reason (the wedding photos) and communicated it respectfully, then she's not wrong. But if her communication was dismissive, maybe she was.\n\nThe author's actions were to ask Kate to stop. That's a reasonable request if she wanted the photos to look a certain way. However, if Kate felt it was about hiding her pregnancy, the author might need to acknowledge that. But ultimately, the author is the one getting married and has the final say on her wedding photos. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
