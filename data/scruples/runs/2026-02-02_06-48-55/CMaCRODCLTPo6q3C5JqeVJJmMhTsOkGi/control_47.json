Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the bride) is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride paid for a wedding photo shoot, and she wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious, which the bride found distracting. The bride asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the bride was wrong to ask Kate to pose normally. On one hand, the bride has the right to decide how she wants her wedding photos to look. The photos are for her wedding, so she should have control over the poses and what's included. It's reasonable for her to not want maternity shots when she paid for a wedding shoot.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity right now, and not being able to show it could be hurtful. But the bride's request was about the photos, not about Kate's body. The bride didn't tell Kate to hide her belly, just not to hold it in a way that's obvious in the photos. The bride's actions were about the event's focus, not about Kate's appearance.\n\nAlso, the bride had to remind Kate a few times, which might indicate that Kate wasn't following the direction, leading to possible frustration. But the bride's intention was to maintain the wedding's aesthetic, which is her right. The fact that Kate is upset now might be more about her feeling disrespected rather than the bride being in the wrong. However, the bride didn't overstep\u2014she just asked her to pose like others. \n\nI think the bride isn't in the wrong because she's within her rights to control the photos as the event owner. The answer should be B (No).\n"
