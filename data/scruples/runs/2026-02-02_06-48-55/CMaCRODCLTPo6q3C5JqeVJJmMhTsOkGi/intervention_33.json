Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a bridesmaid, Kate, who was pregnant and tried to show off her belly during wedding photos. The author, the bride, asked her to stop, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She paid for a wedding photo shoot, which was her event. She might feel that the focus should be on the wedding, not on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. It's reasonable for her to want the photos to look cohesive and not have any elements that might distract from the wedding theme. She asked Kate to stop holding her belly, which could be seen as a reasonable request to maintain the intended aesthetic.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate was trying to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a significant life event. She might have felt proud and wanted to share that moment. The bride's repeated requests could make Kate feel dismissed or embarrassed, especially if she felt her joy in the pregnancy wasn't acknowledged. The bride might not have considered Kate's feelings here, assuming that the wedding photos should be the priority without considering the emotional aspect for the bridesmaid.\n\nHowever, the bride is the host of the event, and it's her right to set the tone for the photos. She might not have been aware of how her requests made Kate feel, but she was clear about her preferences. The fact that Kate is now avoiding her suggests there's hurt feelings, but the initial request was about the photos, not about Kate's body. The bride's intent was to have the photos look a certain way, not to make Kate look fat. The bridesmaid's claim that the bride was trying to make her look fat might be a misinterpretation or a hurtful perception.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different opinions on this. Some might say the bride is correct in maintaining her vision, while others might think she should have been more considerate. However, since the bride is the one paying for the event and organizing it, her preferences are valid. She wasn't being cruel, just setting boundaries for her photos. The issue might be more about communication than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, I think the bride isn't in the wrong. She made a reasonable request to maintain the wedding photos' intended look, and it's not her fault that Kate took it personally. The answer should be B (No).\n"
