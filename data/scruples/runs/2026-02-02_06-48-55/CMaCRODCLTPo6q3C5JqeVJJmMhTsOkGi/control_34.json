Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the bride not allowing her pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride had a professional photo shoot, and she specifically asked the pregnant bridesmaid (Kate) to stop holding her belly to show it off. The bride's main concern was that the photos were for the wedding, not maternity shots, and she paid for a wedding photo shoot. She had to remind Kate multiple times, which led to tension after the wedding. Now, Kate is upset and thinks the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she's within her rights to manage how the photos look. She paid for the service, and it's her wedding. She might have felt that the photos should focus on the wedding theme rather than highlighting individual features unless necessary. However, from Kate's side, being pregnant is a natural part of her body, and she might have felt that showing her belly was a personal choice and that the bride was being dismissive or insensitive. \n\nBut the key points here are consent and communication. The bride asked Kate to stop, which is a direct request. Kate was being deliberate in showing her belly, which the bride found distracting. The bride's intention was to maintain the wedding photo aesthetics. There's no indication that the bride was being malicious. She was trying to ensure the photos aligned with the event's theme. \n\nOn the other hand, Kate might have felt her autonomy was being challenged. However, since it's a group photo and the bride is the client, she has the right to set the photography style. The fact that Kate continued despite being asked could have escalated the situation. The bride's actions were about maintaining the integrity of the wedding photos as per her vision.\n\nSo, the bride isn't in the wrong because she made a reasonable request to maintain the photo shoot's focus. Kate's reaction might stem from a feeling of being judged, but the bride's actions were about the event's photography, not about Kate's body. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
