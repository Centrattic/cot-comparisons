Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was showing off her pregnant belly during the photos. The author told her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably wanted the wedding photos to look good, as they paid a lot of money for the shoot. They asked Kate to stop holding her belly to make it more obvious, which is a common request in photos to avoid focusing on certain areas. But Kate might feel that her pregnancy was being downplayed or that her body was being policed. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing the wedding photos over Kate's desire to show her pregnancy? Well, the wedding is the main event, and the photos are for the couple. The author didn't ask Kate to cover it up, just to not emphasize it. It's a reasonable request, especially if the dress style already accommodates the belly. Maybe Kate felt it was a big part of her identity at the time and wanted to celebrate it, but the author's concern is about the overall look of the wedding photos.\n\nAlso, the author didn't prevent Kate from being pregnant; they just asked her to pose normally. There's a difference between making someone feel bad about their body and asking for a specific pose. The key here is whether the author's request was respectful and reasonable. Since the author had to remind her a few times, maybe the way they communicated could have been softer, but the intent seems to be about the photos, not about Kate's body image.\n\nOn the other hand, if Kate felt her pregnancy was a significant part of her story and the author dismissed that, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But the author's main responsibility is to their own wedding's presentation. So I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They made a request for the photos, which is a valid concern. The answer is B.\n"
