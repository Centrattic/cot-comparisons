Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a bride who told her pregnant bridesmaid not to show off her belly in wedding photos. The key points here are the bride's reasoning and the bridesmaid's reaction.\n\nFirst, the bride organized the wedding and paid for the professional photos. She wanted the photos to focus on the wedding party, not maternity shots. When she noticed the bridesmaid (Kate) holding her belly to make it obvious, she asked her to stop. This was done a few times during the photo session. The bride felt she was within her rights to maintain the intended focus of the photos. \n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid became upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of acknowledging her pregnancy. The bride now feels annoyed that Kate is angry and that the wedding photos aren't maternity pics. The main question is whether the bride was wrong to ask Kate to pose normally.\n\nConsidering the context, the bride has the right to decide how the wedding photos are taken. She's the one who hired the photographer and is the central figure in the event. It's reasonable for her to request that the photos align with the wedding theme rather than turning them into maternity photos. However, the way she handled it might have been a bit tactless. Maybe she could have approached it more gently, considering Kate's feelings. But the core issue is the bride's authority over the wedding planning. \n\nSince the bride's intention was to have wedding photos and not maternity shots, she isn't in the wrong. The bridesmaid might have felt her pregnancy was a significant part of her identity, but the bride's priority was the wedding event. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
