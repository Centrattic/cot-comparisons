Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing her pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The answer options are A or B, where A means the author is at fault and B means they aren't.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author, who is the bride, had a wedding photoshoot with her wedding party. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant and was deliberately holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos. The bride asked her to stop doing that and posed her like the others. Now, Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The bride is confused because she paid for a wedding photoshoot, not a maternity shoot, and is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she's organizing a major event and has specific aesthetics in mind. She likely wanted the photos to look cohesive, with all the bridesmaids dressed similarly without any individual attention to their bodies. Her request for Kate to not hold her belly could be seen as wanting to maintain a certain look for the photoshoot, which is a valid concern. The bride might feel that the photoshoot was about the wedding, not about highlighting individual features, especially when the money was spent on the overall event.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and she wanted to celebrate it during her friend's wedding. By holding her belly, she might have felt she was sharing a personal milestone. The bride's insistence could be perceived as dismissive of Kate's experience, which could hurt feelings. However, it's important to note that the bride is the host of the event and has the final say in how the photos are taken, especially considering the photoshoot is part of her paid event planning.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's right to control the photoshoot and Kate's desire to express her pregnancy. The bride's actions were to maintain the intended aesthetic, which is reasonable. The fact that Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious, which the bride found disruptive, suggests that the bride's request was about uniformity and the purpose of the photoshoot. The bride isn't wrong for wanting the photos to represent the wedding as a whole, not individual features. Additionally, the response from the other bridesmaid indicates that Kate might be taking the feedback personally, which the bride might not be responsible for if she communicated her request politely and repeatedly.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the bride was firm but respectful, reminding Kate multiple times. There's no indication of rudeness or malice, just a desire for the photos to look as intended. The bride's annoyance after the fact might stem from feeling that her event's aesthetics were compromised, not necessarily from a desire to hurt Kate's feelings. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because she had the right to set the parameters for the photoshoot, and her actions were within the bounds of managing her event's visual presentation.\n"
