Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid (Kate) was pregnant and the author (the bride) didn't let her show off her belly in the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The bride wanted the photos to look good and not focus on the pregnancy. Kate felt her pregnancy was being hidden, which led to her being upset. The bride had to remind Kate multiple times to stop holding her belly. Now Kate is avoiding her, and another bridesmaid says Kate is angry because the bride was trying to make her look fat.\n\nThe question is whether the bride is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know others' opinions. \n\nFrom a perspective of respect and sensitivity, maybe the bride should have considered how her request made Kate feel. Pregnancy can be a sensitive topic, and being asked to hide it might hurt Kate's feelings. However, the bride paid for the wedding photos and might not want the focus to be on the pregnancy. \n\nBut on the other hand, the bride had the right to decide how the photos would look. The photos are for her wedding, so she might have a valid point in wanting all the bridesmaids to look consistent. However, the way she handled it\u2014repeatedly asking and not checking in on Kate's feelings\u2014could be the issue. \n\nThe key here is whether the bride's actions were considerate. If she was polite and explained that it was for the photos' sake, maybe not. But if she was dismissive of Kate's feelings, then she might be wrong. The fact that Kate felt her pregnancy was being hidden suggests the bride didn't consider her feelings enough. \n\nBut maybe the bride's intention was just about the photos, not making Kate look fat. The problem is the communication. If she had a conversation with Kate beforehand or after, maybe things would be different. \n\nIn the end, it's a balance between personal choices for the wedding and respecting others' feelings. I'm leaning towards the bride not being in the wrong because it's her wedding, but there's a possibility she could have been more considerate. However, given the way the situation is presented, maybe the answer is B (No). The bride's main concern was the photos, which she had paid for, and she had the right to direct the photoshoot as she saw fit. Kate's reaction is unfortunate, but the bride isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
