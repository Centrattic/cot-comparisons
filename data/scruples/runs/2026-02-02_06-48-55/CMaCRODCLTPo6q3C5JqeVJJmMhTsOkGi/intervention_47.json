Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author didn't let their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. The key points here are the author's actions, Kate's reaction, and the context of the event.\n\nFirst, the author had a professional photoshoot for their wedding, which is a significant event. Kate, being a bridesmaid, was part of the wedding party. The author noticed that Kate was holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos. The author asked her to stop, which Kate didn't comply with immediately. Then, after the wedding, Kate became distant, leading to her being upset because the author \"tried to make her look fat\" instead of pregnant.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. The author's main concern was that the photoshoot was for the wedding, not maternity shots. They paid for the photoshoot, so they might want the focus on the wedding itself. However, Kate was showing off her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her body. The author's request to not show the belly could be seen as trying to avoid highlighting Kate's pregnancy, which might be sensitive.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to accommodate Kate's desire to show her belly? The author might have felt that the photos should be about the wedding, not about other guests' features. However, Kate's pregnancy is a positive life event, and wanting to capture that in the photos is understandable. The author's request was polite but firm, but maybe they didn't consider Kate's feelings. The fact that Kate is upset suggests that the author's actions hurt her feelings, even if the author's intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author paid for the photoshoot, so they have some right to how they want the photos to look. However, the author's bridesmaids are part of the event, and their comfort and feelings should also be considered. The author might have been too focused on their own preferences without considering that Kate wanted to celebrate her pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But the key here is that the author's actions led to a rift with Kate. Even if the author's intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding, not considering Kate's feelings about her pregnancy's visibility could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have the right to control how other people present their bodies in the photos, especially when it's a natural part of their current state (pregnancy). So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because they didn't respect Kate's desire to showcase her pregnancy, which is a personal and joyous moment for her.\n"
