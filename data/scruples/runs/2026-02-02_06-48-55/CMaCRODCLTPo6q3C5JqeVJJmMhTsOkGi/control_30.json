Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a bride who told her pregnant bridesmaid not to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The bride (the author) was having professional photos taken for her wedding. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The bride noticed that Kate was intentionally holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos, similar to maternity shoots. The author asked her to stop and pose like the others, reminding her a few times. After the wedding, the author couldn't reach Kate, who was presumably upset. Another bridesmaid confirmed that Kate was angry because the author was \"trying to make her look fat, not pregnant.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong by asking Kate to not emphasize her pregnancy in the photos. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author paid for a wedding photoshoot, not a maternity shoot. She might feel that the focus should be on the wedding, not on any other aspects. The author could be concerned about how the photos would look, ensuring that the entire wedding party is presentable. It's possible she felt that Kate's deliberate posing was distracting from the main event and wanted all the bridesmaids to look uniform.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate was pregnant, which is a natural part of her body. Holding her belly might not have been to show off but just to support herself or due to discomfort. The author's insistence could be seen as dismissive of Kate's condition. However, the author's intention was to have cohesive photos, not to make Kate feel bad. But if Kate felt that the author was trying to hide her pregnancy, that could lead to hurt feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have considered that Kate wanted to include her pregnancy in the photos, which is a significant part of her life. However, the author's photoshoot was about the wedding, so prioritizing the event's theme is reasonable. The fact that the author had to remind her multiple times might have come off as harsh, but the initial request is understandable.\n\nCommunication is key. The author could have discussed with the wedding party beforehand about the photo style. But since the photos were already taken, maybe the author acted in the moment to maintain the intended look of the photos. However, the aftermath shows that Kate felt targeted, which complicates things.\n\nIn similar situations, people often have different perspectives. The bride's focus was on the wedding, while Kate might have felt her experience was being downplayed. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they could have been perceived as insensitive. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if her intention was purely about the photos and not to make Kate feel bad. The answer might hinge on intent versus impact. The author's intent was to have professional wedding photos, but the impact was hurting Kate's feelings. In such cases, the impact is important, but it doesn't automatically mean the author was wrong if they didn't intend to harm.\n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the community usually considers intent and context. Since the author was clear about not wanting maternity-style photos, and the photos were part of the wedding, the author's stance might be justified. However, the way it was handled (multiple reminders) might have been harsh. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just about the handling. The answer might be B (Not the Asshole) because the author's primary goal was the wedding photos, and she had a right to request how the photos are taken. Kate's reaction might be her own issue, unless the author was unnecessarily harsh. But since the author didn't have ill intent, the answer could be B.\n"
