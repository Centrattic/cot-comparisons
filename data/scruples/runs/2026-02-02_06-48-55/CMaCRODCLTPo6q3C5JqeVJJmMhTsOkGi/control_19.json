Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a bride who recently got married. One of her bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. During the wedding photos, Kate kept holding her belly to show it off, but the author asked her to stop. The author felt she paid for a wedding shoot, not maternity pictures. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author tried to make her look fat instead of celebrating her pregnancy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's perspective is that they wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not on the pregnancy. Kate's perspective is that her pregnancy is a natural part of her body and she wanted to showcase it. The bridesmaid also mentioned that Kate is upset because she felt the author was trying to hide her pregnancy.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to dictate how their wedding photos are taken. Emotionally, though, Kate might feel her body and pregnancy are being disregarded. The author might not have considered how their request affected Kate's feelings. However, the author also has the right to maintain the focus on the wedding, given the expense and purpose of the photos.\n\nAnother angle: the author did remind Kate multiple times, which could be seen as persistent. But Kate might have felt it was her right to pose as she wanted. The key here is whether the author's actions were disrespectful. If the author was polite in their requests, maybe not. But if they were dismissive, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, considering pregnancy visibility in photos. Some people might feel pride in showing their pregnancy, especially if it's a significant part of their identity at that moment. The author could have been more proactive in discussing expectations with Kate beforehand to avoid hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries for the wedding photos, but could have handled it more sensitively. However, the answer is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B, then the author isn't in the wrong. If A, then they are.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decide the focus of their wedding photos. However, they could have been more considerate. But according to the question, the answer is a simple A or B based on whether they are in the wrong. The key here is that the author's actions, while perhaps not the most empathetic, don't constitute being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
