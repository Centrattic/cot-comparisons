Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not allowing a pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The author intervened when Kate was holding her belly to make it noticeable, asking her to stop. Now Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid mentioned she's angry because the author was \"trying to make her look fat, not pregnant.\" The author is confused and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible perspectives here. The author's main point is about wanting the wedding photos to look good and not have maternity shots. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a natural part of her current state and that the author's request was insensitive. \n\nPregnancy can be a significant and personal milestone, and some people might want to showcase it, especially if it's 7 months along. The author's concern is about the photoshoot's purpose\u2014wedding photos versus maternity. However, asking someone to not hold their belly in a way that emphasizes it could be seen as dismissive of their pregnancy, especially if done in front of others. \n\nAlso, the fact that Kate was a bridesmaid, and the author had to remind her multiple times suggests that Kate felt comfortable doing it in the first place. The author's intention was to maintain the wedding photos' aesthetic, but the method of repeatedly asking might have come across as harsh. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Maybe the author could have found a compromise, like allowing some shots where the belly is visible and others where it's not, but the author chose to stop it entirely. This could have made Kate feel embarrassed or invalidated. \n\nHowever, the author paid for the wedding photos, which are centered around their event. They might not want the focus to shift to another person's pregnancy. But it's also about respecting Kate's wishes. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were justified in maintaining the photoshoot's focus. If the author communicated clearly and respectfully, maybe there's less fault. But since Kate felt targeted and the other bridesmaid confirmed she's upset, it's possible the author's approach was too direct and insensitive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a right to dictate how their wedding photos look. But there might be room for empathy and a better approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A for yes, then the author is at fault, and B for no. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because they have the right to control the aesthetic of their wedding photos. However, I should also consider if there's a middle ground. But the user said they think the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. \n\nWait, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. Instead of stopping it, maybe discuss with Kate beforehand. But in the situation, the author acted in the moment. The problem is Kate felt her pregnancy wasn't respected. But the author's perspective is about their own event. It's a tricky balance between personal preferences and respecting others' feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be understandable, they might have been too abrupt without considering Kate's feelings. But the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author paid for their wedding photos and has the right to decide the photos' composition, the answer might be B. But some might argue A. However, I think B is more accurate here.\n"
