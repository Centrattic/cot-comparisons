Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, the bride, had a wedding and didn't want the pregnant bridesmaid (Kate) to show off her belly during the photos. The bride had to ask Kate multiple times to stop holding her belly, and now Kate is upset. The bride is confused because she paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots, and feels Kate was being self-conscious.\n\nSo, who's right here? Let's break it down. The bride has the right to decide how the wedding photos are taken. She's investing money into professional photos, so she probably expects them to look like wedding photos. If Kate was intentionally trying to show her belly, the bride might reasonably ask her to stop to maintain the desired aesthetic.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate is pregnant and might feel that showing her belly is a natural part of her current state. She might have felt that the bride was being insensitive by not allowing it, especially if others in the wedding party weren't being asked to hide their body features. The fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid confirmed she's angry suggests there's hurt feelings here.\n\nBut the key point is the bride's responsibility. She's organizing the event and paying for the photos, so she has the authority to set the tone. If Kate was making a deliberate choice to draw attention to her belly, the bride's request to stop isn't unreasonable. However, if the dress was flowy and the belly was naturally showing, maybe the bride should have been more accommodating. But the story says Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it obvious, which implies she was trying to show it off beyond what the dress would naturally allow.\n\nSo, the bride's actions might be justified. She's in charge of the photos and can set guidelines. The issue is whether her request was respectful. If she was polite and gave clear directions, she's within her rights. But if she was harsh, maybe not. The story says she asked a few times, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the flip side, Kate's upset feelings are valid. She might feel the bride was being insensitive, but the bride's perspective is about the photos' purpose. It's a clash between the bride's event planning and Kate's personal expression.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong (B). The bride has the right to control how the wedding photos look, especially when she's paying for them. Kate's actions of deliberately showing her belly might have been inappropriate for the context, and the bride's request is reasonable. However, the bride should consider being empathetic and maybe offer a compromise, like a separate maternity shot if needed. But in the context of the wedding photos, the bride's stance makes sense.\n"
