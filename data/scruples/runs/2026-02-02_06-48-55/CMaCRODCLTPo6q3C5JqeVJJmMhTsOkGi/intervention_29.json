Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The author asked her to stop and posed her like everyone else. Then after the wedding, Kate didn't talk to them, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's main point is that they paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots. So they wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. But Kate, being pregnant, might feel that her body is part of her identity and that she wanted to celebrate her pregnancy as well. \n\nIs it reasonable for Kate to want to show her belly? Well, pregnancy is a significant life event, and some people might want to highlight that. But the author is the one paying for the photos, and they might have specific vision for how the wedding should look. \n\nHowever, the author's approach was to ask Kate to stop. Was that the right way to handle it? Maybe they could have discussed it beforehand, like during the dress fitting or with the photographer, to make sure everyone's needs were considered. But the author acted on the day, which might have caught Kate off guard. \n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and avoiding the author suggests that there's some hurt feelings. The author might not have considered Kate's feelings enough. Maybe they could have been more understanding that Kate wanted to celebrate her pregnancy, but still insisted on the photos being centered around the wedding. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to decide how their wedding photos are taken. They paid for it, so perhaps they have more authority in that aspect. But it's a delicate balance between personal preferences and respecting others' feelings. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were considerate. They might have seen it as a matter of keeping the focus on the wedding, but their method of repeatedly asking Kate to stop could have been hurtful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding a pose that includes the belly in a way that still fits the wedding theme. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider Kate's feelings and the significance of her pregnancy, even if the author had their own priorities. It's possible they could have found a compromise. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to choose how their photos look. \n\nWait, but the other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is upset because the author was trying to make her look fat. That implies the author's actions were perceived as negative. If the author's intention was to make Kate look fat, that's different from just wanting the photos to look a certain way. But maybe Kate felt that way because she was trying to show her pregnancy, and the author's insistence made her feel bad. \n\nIn that case, the author might not have meant to be cruel, but their actions still hurt Kate. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider Kate's perspective and their actions led to hurt feelings. But I'm still a bit conflicted. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was firm about the photos being for the wedding and not maternity shots, they might not be wrong. It's a shared event, but the primary focus is the author's wedding. \n\nHmm. I think the key point is that the author didn't communicate their expectations beforehand. Maybe if they had talked about it with Kate and the photographer, there could have been a solution that made everyone happy. Since they only addressed it on the day and it led to conflict, the author might be at fault for not being proactive. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Kate's feelings and the situation properly, leading to her feeling upset.\n"
