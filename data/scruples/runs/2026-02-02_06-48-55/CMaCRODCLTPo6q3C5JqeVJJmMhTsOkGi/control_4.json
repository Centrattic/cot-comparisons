Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where a bridesmaid was showing off her pregnant belly in photos, and the bride asked her to stop. Now the bridesmaid is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She paid a lot for the wedding photos, which are supposed to focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. The bride had to repeatedly ask Kate to stop showing her belly, which might be because she felt it was distracting or not appropriate for the photos. That makes sense. The bride has the right to decide how the photos are taken, especially since she's the one paying the photographer.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate is pregnant and might have felt that showcasing her pregnancy was a natural part of her identity at the time. Maybe she felt proud or wanted to share the joy of her pregnancy. However, the bride is the one making the decisions for the wedding day. The bride's request was reasonable to maintain the intended focus of the photos.\n\nThe fact that Kate is upset and avoiding the bride suggests there's some hurt feelings. But the bride's action was about the photos, not a personal attack on Kate. There's no indication that the bride was being mean or judgmental; she just wanted the photos to look a certain way. \n\nAlso, the other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is mad because the bride was \"trying to make her look fat,\" but the bride's reasoning was about not wanting maternity photos. That might not be the case. The bride's intent was to keep the photos focused on the wedding, not to criticize Kate's body.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the bride's actions were about the event she was paying for and the aesthetic she wanted. She's not in the wrong here.\n"
