Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was getting married and had a professional photo shoot. Kate, a bridesmaid, was about seven months pregnant. The author noticed that Kate was holding her belly in a way to make it obvious in the photos, similar to maternity photos. The author asked her to stop and pose like everyone else. She had to remind her a few times. After the wedding, Kate seemed upset and other bridesmaids said Kate was mad that the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. \n\nThe author is now wondering if they were in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author paid for the wedding photos and might not want them to focus on Kate's pregnancy. The author might have felt the photos should be about the wedding, not maternity shots. On the other hand, Kate was pregnant, and the author's request could have been perceived as trying to hide her pregnancy, which might be hurtful. \n\nBut wait, the author's main point is that they paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pictures. The author had a right to direct how the photos look, considering it's their wedding. However, maybe the way they asked Kate was a bit abrupt or insensitive. Did the author consider Kate's feelings? The author might have not realized that Kate wanted to show her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her life. \n\nBut the key here is that the author asked Kate to stop holding her belly in a way that made it obvious. The author's intention was to have the wedding party photos as part of the wedding theme, not focusing on individual features. However, Kate might have felt that her pregnancy was being downplayed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was the one who asked Kate to stop. If Kate felt that her pregnancy was not being acknowledged, maybe the author should have considered that. But on the other hand, the author has the right to direct their wedding photos. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had the right to ask Kate to pose in a way that fits the wedding photos. It's their event, and they can make requests about how the photos are taken. Kate might be overreacting, especially since the author was polite but firm in her requests. The author didn't force her to cover up, just asked for more natural poses. It's possible that Kate took it the wrong way, but the author's intentions were about the photos, not about making her look fat. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
