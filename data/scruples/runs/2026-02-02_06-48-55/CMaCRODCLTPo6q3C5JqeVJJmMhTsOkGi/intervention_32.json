Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong. The situation is about a bride who didn't let her pregnant bridesmaid hold her belly in wedding photos, and now the bridesmaid is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride paid for a wedding photo shoot, so she might feel it's about her wedding and the photos should focus on her and the wedding party as a group. She might not want the photos to look like a maternity shoot. On the other hand, Kate, the bridesmaid, is pregnant and might have wanted to show her pregnancy, which is a personal milestone. The bride had to remind her multiple times, which could be seen as being overly strict or not respectful of Kate's feelings.\n\nBut then, the bride did ask Kate to stop, which could be seen as reasonable to maintain the focus on the wedding. However, maybe the bride should have considered an alternative, like adjusting the posing to make it look natural without making Kate feel forced to hide her belly. The fact that Kate is upset and avoiding the bride suggests that the bride's actions hurt her feelings. \n\nThe bride might not be in the wrong because she's the one paying for the photos and setting the tone. But maybe she could have handled it more sensitively. For example, maybe she could have talked to Kate beforehand about the photo style instead of during the shoot. The key points are respect for the bride's wishes versus Kate's desire to show her pregnancy. \n\nIf the bride made Kate feel embarrassed or belittled, that's a problem. But if the bride just wanted the photos to look a certain way and asked politely, then maybe it's not. The fact that the bride had to remind her multiple times might indicate that Kate was being uncooperative, but the bride's initial request might not have been wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's the one organizing the event and has the right to set the parameters for the photos. However, there's a nuance where she could have communicated better. But according to the scenario, she asked politely and even had to remind, which might be within her rights. The main issue is whether showing the belly was against the wedding photo theme, which the bride could decide. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
