Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, is pregnant. The author, the bride, didn't want Kate to show off her belly in the photos by holding her hands in a way that makes the belly obvious. The bride asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The bride is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride paid a lot for the wedding photos, which she likely wants to look good and focus on the wedding. She might feel that Kate's deliberate posing for her belly was taking attention away from the main event. On the other hand, Kate could feel that her body and pregnancy are valid and that the bride is being insensitive by not allowing her to show her pregnancy as she wanted.\n\nThe bride's request was about how the photos should look, maybe to maintain a certain aesthetic. But the way she approached it might have come off as dismissive of Kate's feelings. If the bride had a different vision for the photos and communicated that respectfully, maybe there wouldn't be a problem. However, if Kate felt her desire to celebrate her pregnancy was being ignored, that's a valid concern.\n\nIt's also possible that the bride didn't consider that Kate might feel proud of her pregnancy and wanted to include that in the wedding photos as part of her identity. The bride's focus on the wedding photos as a central part of her day is understandable, but she might not have realized the importance of Kate's personal expression in those moments.\n\nThe key here is whether the bride's actions were respectful. She asked Kate to stop, which is her right as the bride, but if it was done without empathy or understanding, that could be an issue. The problem might be more about communication and sensitivity rather than who is technically right or wrong.\n\nIn the end, the bride's priority is her wedding photos, which she paid for. But Kate's feelings about her own body and pregnancy are also important. The bride might not be in the wrong for wanting the photos to look a certain way, but she could have handled it more thoughtfully. However, considering that it's the bride's day and the photos are part of that event, she's probably not the asshole. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
