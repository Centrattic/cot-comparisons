Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the bride is in the wrong for not allowing her pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the bride had a professional photoshoot planned, which she paid for, and she wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not a maternity shoot. She noticed Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos, so she asked her to stop. The bride had to remind her a few times. After the wedding, Kate stopped communicating and another bridesmaid said she was upset because the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The bride has the right to control how her wedding photos are taken, especially since she's paying for the photoshoot. However, the way she handled it might have been sensitive. She asked Kate to stop, but maybe she didn't consider Kate's feelings or motivations. Kate might have felt her pregnancy was important to showcase, especially if it's a significant part of her identity at that stage. The bride's insistence could be seen as dismissive of Kate's desire to share that aspect of her life.\n\nBut\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762, the bride also has a right to prioritize her wedding's aesthetic. She might not want the photos to focus on anything else. However, the fact that Kate was trying to show off her belly could be a personal choice, and the bride's repeated corrections might have come off as rude or insensitivity.\n\nThe other bridesmaid's comment that Kate was angry because the bride was trying to make her look fat adds complexity. The bride didn't intend to do that, but maybe her approach wasn't empathetic enough. It's possible that the bride didn't consider that Kate might feel her body was being criticized, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nSo, is the bride in the wrong? Well, she had a valid reason for wanting the photos to be about the wedding. However, the way she handled the situation could have been more considerate. She should have maybe discussed the photo plans with Kate beforehand to set expectations. Since she didn't, and her actions led to hurt feelings, she might be partially at fault. But it's a nuanced situation where both parties could have communicated better. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whose perspective we take. The bride had the right to ask for certain poses, but she might not have handled it with enough sensitivity. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider Kate's feelings adequately. Alternatively, if the bride's intention was purely to keep the photos focused on the wedding without maternity aspects, she's not in the wrong. But given the outcome of hurt feelings, maybe there's some fault. Hmm.\n"
