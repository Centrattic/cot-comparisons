Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a wedding where the author, the bride, didn't let her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the photos. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the bride had a professional photo shoot, which she paid for. She noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly to show it off, similar to maternity photos. The bride asked her to stop, and Kate became upset, feeling the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. Now they're not talking, and the bride is confused if she was wrong.\n\nSo, considering the bride's perspective: She paid for the wedding photos, which are supposed to focus on the wedding party and the event. She might feel that the photos should highlight her wedding day, not a maternity shoot. Also, Kate was a bridesmaid, so the focus is on the bride and groom. The bride might not want the photos to distract from her own day.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate is pregnant, and it's a natural part of her body. She might feel that her pregnancy is a significant aspect of her life and wanted to celebrate it. The bride's request could be seen as dismissive of Kate's current situation. However, the bride also has the right to direct how her wedding photos are taken, especially since she's paying for it. It's her event, and she might not want any part of the photos to draw attention away from the wedding itself.\n\nThe key points are: The bride's right to control the photography (since it's her event and her money), and Kate's right to express her pregnancy. However, the bride's request was about posing for the wedding photos, not about Kate's body. Kate was using the photos as an opportunity to showcase her pregnancy, which the bride might not have wanted. The bride had to remind her multiple times, which suggests Kate was persistent in her actions despite the bride's request.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for wedding photos to focus on the wedding party. Guests, even close friends, are expected to follow the bride's lead. If Kate felt her pregnancy was important to highlight, maybe she should have discussed it with the bride beforehand to find a compromise. The bride might not have considered that Kate wanted to include her pregnancy in the photos, but the fact that the bride had to repeatedly ask suggests that Kate wasn't respecting the bride's wishes during the event.\n\nThe bride might also be concerned about the photos being about her day, not about other guests' events. It's possible that the bride didn't realize the significance to Kate until after the fact, but once she noticed, she acted on her preference. The fact that Kate is now upset and avoiding the bride adds tension, but the initial request was within the bride's rights as the event organizer.\n\nSo considering all that, the bride was within her rights to ask Kate to pose appropriately for the wedding photos. The photos were her responsibility and expense, and the focus was on her wedding. Kate's desire to show her pregnancy doesn't override the bride's authority in this context. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
