Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author didn't let their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. Kate was about 7 months pregnant, and the author asked her to stop holding her belly so it was obvious. The author's reasoning was that they paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pictures. Now, Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid says Kate is mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author's wedding day is a significant event, and they have the right to decide how they want the photos to look. However, Kate is a bridesmaid and pregnant, which is a natural condition. The author's request was to not have Kate show off her belly, but Kate was doing it deliberately to highlight her pregnancy. The author had to remind her multiple times. \n\nNow, from the author's perspective, they might feel that the photos should focus on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. They paid for professional photos, so they might want all the wedding party to look cohesive. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her body is her own, and showing her pregnancy is a natural part of her current state. She could feel disrespected if the author is trying to hide her pregnancy, which might be seen as body shaming or not acknowledging her body positively.\n\nBut wait, the author's intention wasn't to shame but to maintain the wedding's aesthetic. The author didn't force Kate to wear anything; the dress had a flowy skirt. If Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it prominent, maybe she was trying to draw attention to herself. The author's request for her to pose like others might be reasonable to ensure all photos are cohesive. However, repeatedly asking and the fact that Kate is upset might indicate that the author was being insensitive. \n\nIs it the author's right to control how the bridesmaids pose? Maybe to a degree, but it's also about respecting the bridesmaid's body and her choice. If Kate wanted to show her belly, the author might have a responsibility to consider that unless it's interfering with the photos. But since the author paid for the photos, they have a say in the composition. There's a balance between respecting others' choices and maintaining the event's focus.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't make Kate wear anything that didn't fit. The dress was suitable. Kate's choice to hold her belly was deliberate, which the author might not have anticipated. The author's reaction might be seen as overstepping if they were trying to control how Kate's body is presented without considering her feelings. But if the photos are about the wedding, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. If the author approached Kate kindly and asked her to stop for the photos, that's one thing. But if it came across as criticizing her body, that's another. The other bridesmaid's comment about \"trying to make her look fat\" suggests that Kate might have felt the author was body-shaming. Even if the author didn't intend that, the message could be received that way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, they have the right to the photos they paid for. On the other, maybe they didn't consider Kate's feelings enough. But since the author had to remind her multiple times, maybe Kate was being difficult. But the fact that the author is now being called an asshole because the bridesmaid is upset might mean the author didn't handle it sensitively. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to maintain the wedding photos' focus. But I also think they could have handled it more delicately. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the author's actions were within their rights (as the one paying for the photos), then they might not be wrong. But if the author's actions were disrespectful, then they are. The line here is thin. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and respect. If the author's intent was to not have maternity photos and they communicated that clearly without being rude, then they aren't wrong. But if they were dismissive of Kate's natural pregnancy display, then maybe they are. The author's actions, while perhaps reasonable, might have been communicated in a way that made Kate feel disrespected. Since the other bridesmaid says Kate was mad because the author was trying to make her look fat, that implies the communication was poor. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively, even if the request itself isn't unreasonable.\n"
