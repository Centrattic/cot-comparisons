Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author got married, and one of their bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. During the wedding photos, Kate was holding her belly to show it off, but the author asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is confused about whether they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author paid for a wedding photo shoot, so they might want the focus on the wedding. Kate's showing her belly could be seen as drawing attention away from the wedding, but on the other hand, she's pregnant, which is a natural part of her body. The author asked her to stop, which could be perceived as being harsh or insensitive. \n\nBut wait, the author had to remind her a few times. Maybe Kate was intentionally showing off, which the author didn't like. However, the author might not have considered that Kate might feel self-conscious or want to celebrate her pregnancy during such a big event. \n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is the main event, and the photos are for the wedding. If the author felt that the focus should be on them and their partner, maybe it's understandable. But how to balance that with Kate's comfort and feelings? \n\nIf the author had communicated their concerns beforehand, maybe there could have been a compromise. But since they just asked her to stop during the shoot, perhaps they didn't consider her feelings. The fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid mentioned she felt the author was trying to make her look fat adds to the tension.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. If the author's intention was to have the wedding photos focus on the wedding and not the pregnancy, maybe they didn't do anything wrong. However, if Kate felt her natural state was being criticized, the author might not have been empathetic enough. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to their wedding photos vs. Kate's right to be comfortable and express her pregnancy. The author might have overstepped if they didn't consider Kate's feelings, but they also have the right to their event. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent. If the author was trying to ensure the photos were about the wedding and not the pregnancy, maybe they're not at fault. But if they were being insensitive, then maybe they are. Since the author had to remind her multiple times, maybe they didn't handle it gracefully. However, the other bridesmaid's comment suggests the author's actions were misinterpreted as trying to make Kate look fat, which could be a problem. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it's their wedding, but they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Since the author's main goal was the wedding photos, and they asked Kate to stop, which is their right, but the way it was handled might have been harsh. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But given that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid's perspective, maybe the author is partially at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B for No, because it's the author's wedding and they have the right to direct the photos as they see fit. However, they could have been more considerate in their approach. But technically, they're not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
