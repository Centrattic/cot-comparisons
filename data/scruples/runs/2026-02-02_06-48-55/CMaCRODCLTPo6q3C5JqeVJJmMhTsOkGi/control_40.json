Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing a pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the bride wanted professional photos of the wedding party. She had to ask her bridesmaid, Kate, multiple times to stop holding her belly to make it more visible. The bride felt the photos should focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. Now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nSo, the main issue here is conflict between the bride's desire for wedding photos and Kate's personal choice to highlight her pregnancy. The bride's actions were about maintaining the intended focus of the photos. She paid for a wedding shoot, not maternity photos, so she's within her rights to direct the photos as she sees fit. However, maybe she could have handled it more sensitively, like discussing the poses beforehand to avoid hurt feelings. But the core of the problem is that the bride is the one who organized the event and has the right to set the tone. Kate's reaction might be overblown, especially since the bride was trying to keep the focus on the wedding. The bride isn't in the wrong here because she's managing her event as she sees fit. So the answer is B.\n"
