Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was trying to show off her pregnant belly in the photos, and the author, the bride, asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset, and the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride paid for professional photos of the wedding party. She asked Kate to stop holding her belly because it was making her look pregnant instead of just being part of the wedding photos. The bride felt the photos were about the wedding, not maternity shots. \n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that she was trying to share her pregnancy joy and that her body was being criticized. The bride had to remind Kate multiple times, which might have come off as harsh. Maybe the bride didn't consider Kate's feelings, even if her intention was to keep the focus on the wedding.\n\nBut then again, the bride is the one who paid for the shoot and has the right to decide how the photos should look. She might not want the photos to be about other people's pregnancies. Also, the dress was flowy, so maybe the belly wasn't that obvious unless Kate was holding it. The bride's request was reasonable to maintain the intended aesthetic.\n\nHowever, the way she handled it could be a problem. Maybe she could have been more understanding and suggested alternative poses. The key here is intent versus impact. The bride's intent was to have good wedding photos, but her actions might have made Kate feel judged, especially if it's a sensitive topic. \n\nIn some cultures or personal beliefs, pregnancy is something to be celebrated, so asking someone not to show their belly might be seen as dismissive. But again, the bride's right to her own preferences in her wedding photos is a factor. It's a balance between respecting the guest's situation and the host's wishes.\n\nSo, is the bride in the wrong? If she was unkind or made a big deal out of it, maybe. But if she was firm but polite, perhaps not. The fact that she had to remind Kate multiple times suggests that Kate might not have taken the hint, which complicates things. The answer might depend on how the interaction went. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the bride has the right to decide the composition of her wedding photos. However, she could have handled it more sensitively. The main issue is that she was assertive in her request, which is reasonable for her own event. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have been more empathetic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
