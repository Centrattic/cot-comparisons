Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not letting a bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in wedding photos. The author, as the bride, had to ask Kate to stop holding her belly because they wanted the photos to look a certain way. Now Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid said Kate is mad that the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding photos are supposed to focus on the bride and the wedding party, not on maternity shots. The author might have felt that the emphasis on the belly was distracting or not in line with the overall aesthetic they wanted. But on the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and that the author was being insensitive by not allowing her to show it off.\n\nThe author's main point is that they paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pictures. That suggests they wanted the photos to be about the wedding, which is understandable. However, the way they handled it\u2014repeatedly asking Kate to stop\u2014might have been abrupt or not considerate of Kate's feelings. Maybe the author didn't realize that Kate wanted to be recognized as pregnant, which could be a valid concern. It's possible that the author's insistence on a certain pose made Kate feel embarrassed or excluded.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate was a bridesmaid means she was an important part of the wedding party. If the author noticed the behavior, maybe there was a better way to address it without making Kate feel criticized. Perhaps a private, kind reminder instead of public corrections. The other bridesmaid's comment indicating Kate is upset adds weight to the idea that the author's approach was hurtful.\n\nBut then again, the bride is the one who is getting married and has the right to decide how the photos should look. It's their special day, and they might have specific preferences. However, the key here is whether the author's request was reasonable and communicated in a respectful way. If Kate was trying to draw attention to her belly, maybe the author was right to redirect her, but the method could be questioned.\n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and communication. If the author was being considerate but firm in maintaining the wedding photo focus, they might not be in the wrong. But if the author was dismissive of Kate's desire to celebrate her pregnancy, then they could be seen as insensitive. Since the other bridesmaid said Kate felt it was \"trying to make her look fat,\" that implies the author's actions were perceived as negative. However, the author's intention was to keep the photos about the wedding, not to criticize Kate's body. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. But given that the bride has the final say in how the wedding photos are taken, and the fact that the photos are for her event, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way the request was made might have been a better approach. Still, the core of the issue is about the bride's right to dictate the photo style versus the bridesmaid's right to express her current state. Since the author was clear about their preference and the photos are for their own event, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe A if the author was overly controlling or didn't consider the other person's feelings. The question is whether the author was wrong for not allowing it. If the author had a valid reason related to the photo's purpose, then B. If they were being inconsiderate, then A. The text doesn't mention the author being rude, just firm. So perhaps B.\n"
