Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a professional photoshoot and wanted consistent poses for the wedding party. She asked Kate to stop holding her belly to show off the pregnancy, which Kate found offensive. The author's reasoning is that she didn't want maternity photos but wedding photos. However, Kate's intention was to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her life at the moment. \n\nNow, thinking about the context: the dress was flowy, so maybe the belly wouldn't be too noticeable. But Kate wanted to highlight her pregnancy, which is a personal choice. The author's request could be seen as dismissive of Kate's pregnancy. But on the other hand, the author is responsible for organizing the photoshoot and ensuring the photos are cohesive. \n\nI should also consider the relationship dynamics. The author is the bride, so she has some authority in organizing the event. However, the bridesmaids are guests and have their own comfort and personal milestones. If Kate felt her pregnancy wasn't acknowledged, that's a valid feeling. But the author might have had a legitimate concern about the photos looking disjointed.\n\nAnother angle: Was the author's approach respectful? The author had to remind Kate multiple times, which could come off as harsh. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like discussing the photo plan beforehand. But it's also the bride's wedding, so she has the final say on how the photos look.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some people might see the pregnancy as a positive thing to highlight, while others might prefer the focus to stay on the wedding. The key here is whether the author had the right to dictate that in this context. Also, considering that Kate is a bridesmaid, her role is to support the bride, but her own personal situation (pregnancy) is a valid part of her identity.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author wanted consistent photos, which is reasonable. Kate wanted to celebrate her pregnancy, which is also valid. The conflict arises from differing priorities. If the author didn't communicate her preferences in advance, that might be an issue. However, once the photoshoot is happening, the bride has the right to direct how the photos look, especially since she's paying for it. \n\nBut the author's approach could be seen as insensitive if she didn't consider Kate's feelings. The fact that Kate felt avoided and upset suggests that the author might have handled it poorly. However, the author's main intent wasn't to be mean but to have cohesive photos. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because it's her wedding and she's responsible for the photos. However, there's a possibility that she could have been more considerate in her approach. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether her actions were justified. Given that the photos are a significant expense and part of the wedding, I think the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
