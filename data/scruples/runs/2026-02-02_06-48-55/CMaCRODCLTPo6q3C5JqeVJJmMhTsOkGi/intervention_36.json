Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where one of the bridesmaids, Kate, was showing off her pregnant belly during the photos, and the author asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset and other bridesmaids say she's mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that the wedding photos should focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. They paid for a specific shoot and might not want the focus on Kate's pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate might feel her body during pregnancy is a natural part of her life and she's entitled to show it off, especially since her dress allowed for it. The author had to remind her multiple times, which could be seen as being pushy, but maybe the author just wanted consistent poses for the photos.\n\nI should think about social norms. Weddings are big events, and the photos are usually centered around the couple. However, a bridesmaid being pregnant isn't unusual. The author's request might be seen as reasonable if they wanted to maintain a certain aesthetic. But repeatedly asking could come across as insensitive if Kate felt her choice to show her belly was being policed.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Kate is avoiding the author, and others say she's upset. The author might not have considered that Kate's choice to show her belly was personal, and interrupting that could hurt her feelings. But the author also has a right to set boundaries for their own event.\n\nMaybe the key point is consent and mutual respect. The author had the right to ask for a specific pose, but if Kate felt her autonomy was disrespected, that's a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author was the one organizing the event and the photos, it's reasonable they have some say in how the photos are taken. Kate's dress had a flowy skirt that might accentuate the belly, and the author might have wanted the photos to not focus on that. But the author could have been more considerate in their approach, maybe discussing it beforehand instead of during the shoot.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. If the author's main intent was to have the photos reflect the wedding, they might not be in the wrong. But if their actions were dismissive of Kate's feelings about her body, then they could be. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the author had to remind her multiple times and now Kate is upset, there's a chance the author didn't handle it sensitively. But the initial request might still be justified. I think the answer is a bit of both, but according to the user's instructions, it's a binary choice. Given that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had the right to set the photo guidelines for their event.\n"
