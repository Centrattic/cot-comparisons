Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author (the bride) asked her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, not to hold her belly in the photos. The bride felt that the photos were for the wedding, not maternity shots, and wanted the focus on the wedding party. Now, Kate is upset, and the bride is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride was paying for the professional photos, which were part of the wedding. She wanted the photos to look good and consistent with the wedding theme. Kate, being pregnant, might have felt that showing her belly was natural, especially since the dress was flowy and the belly was visible. The bride repeatedly asked Kate to stop, which might have come across as dismissive or critical.\n\nBut is the bride in the wrong? Well, the bride has the right to decide how the wedding photos are taken, especially since she's the one paying. However, the way she communicated her request could have been a factor. Did she do it in a respectful and considerate manner? If she was harsh or repeatedly nagging, that could have hurt Kate's feelings. On the other hand, Kate might have felt entitled to show her belly, perhaps as a way to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a significant life event.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic between the bride and her bridesmaids. The bride's role is to have the wedding of her dreams, and the bridesmaids are there to support her. However, the bridesmaids also have their own feelings and circumstances. The bride's request was about the photos, which is a valid concern. But if Kate felt that her body and pregnancy were being invalidated, that's a different issue. \n\nThe key points are: the bride's right to the photos as she wants, the consideration of Kate's feelings, and whether the bride's actions were disrespectful. If the bride was polite and explained her reasoning, maybe it's more understandable. But if she was dismissive, it could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the other bridesmaid confirmed Kate's hurt feelings suggests that the bride's actions might have been perceived as negative.\n\nSo, is the bride in the wrong? I think there's a balance here. The bride's intention was about the photos, which is her prerogative, but she might not have considered Kate's feelings enough. It's possible that a compromise could have been made, like allowing some photos where the belly is visible but not all. The fact that the bride had to remind her multiple times might have made Kate feel singled out. Therefore, the bride might not be entirely in the wrong, but she could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nGiven that the bride was trying to maintain the wedding photo theme, which is her right, and if she communicated her request respectfully, then she's not in the wrong. However, if the approach was hurtful, then she might be. Since the story doesn't specify the tone, but the other bridesmaid says Kate is \"pissed\" and the bride feels it was about the photos, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance. However, in typical AITA scenarios, the bride's perspective is often considered valid if it's about her own event. So the answer is B.\n"
