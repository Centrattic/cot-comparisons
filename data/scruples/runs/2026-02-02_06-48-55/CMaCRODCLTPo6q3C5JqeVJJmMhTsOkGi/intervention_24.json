Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they did something wrong by not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the situation: Kate, the bridesmaid, is 7 months pregnant. She was holding her belly during the photos, which the author and the wedding dress's style allowed. The author asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that they wanted the photos to be about the wedding, not maternity shots. They might have felt that the focus should be on the wedding party and the event itself. But Kate felt her pregnancy was being downplayed, which is understandable since pregnancy can be a significant personal milestone. \n\nThe key points here are consent and consideration. The author did communicate with Kate, asking her to stop adjusting her belly. However, Kate might have felt her body autonomy was being questioned. The author might have considered offering an alternative, like having a separate photo where Kate can show her belly if she wanted, but the main photos should stay focused on the wedding. \n\nOn the other hand, the author paid for the photos, and they might have a legitimate reason to want the photos to reflect the wedding theme. But it's also possible that the author didn't consider Kate's feelings or the importance of her pregnancy to her identity at that moment. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not have realized that by asking Kate to stop, they were making her feel like her body wasn't accepted or that her pregnancy was something to be hidden. This could be seen as a lack of empathy. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that their personal milestones, like pregnancy, should be celebrated even within the context of another event. However, the author's main event was the wedding, and they might not want the photos to be a mix of different themes. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of Kate's feelings versus necessary to maintain the focus of the wedding photos. If the author had a respectful and kind approach, maybe there's less fault. But the fact that Kate is upset and feels targeted might indicate the author needs to consider her perspective more. \n\nBut since the author did ask politely (as per the account), and the issue is more about differing priorities, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's intention was to have wedding photos, so they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author didn't consider Kate's desire to showcase her pregnancy, they could be at least partially at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to maintain the focus on their wedding, but there's definitely a need for more empathy and communication. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they could have handled it better.\n"
