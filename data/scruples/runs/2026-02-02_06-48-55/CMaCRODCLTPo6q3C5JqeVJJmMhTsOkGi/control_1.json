Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author (the bride) didn't allow her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly during the wedding photos. The bride had to remind Kate a few times to stop holding her belly to make it obvious, and now Kate is upset because she feels the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She paid for a wedding photoshoot, not a maternity shoot, and wanted the photos to focus on the wedding itself. She might have felt that the focus was on her and the wedding party, not on individual features like a pregnancy. It's common for brides to have specific vision for their photos, and maybe she wanted the dresses to look a certain way without the belly being the focus.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel hurt because during pregnancy, women often feel self-conscious about their bodies, and showing the belly can be a positive and empowering experience. If Kate was trying to celebrate her pregnancy, the bride's repeated reminders could be seen as dismissive or insensitive. However, it's also possible that Kate wasn't respecting the bride's wishes for the photoshoot, which is a different angle.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The bride had the right to set the tone for the photoshoot as part of her event. If Kate was intentionally trying to make her belly prominent despite being asked not to, that's a different issue. The bride's actions were to maintain the integrity of the photoshoot she paid for. However, the bride might need to consider if her reminders were polite or if she could have handled it differently, like explaining her reasons to Kate privately.\n\nBut the main question is whether the bride is in the wrong. Since she asked Kate to stop showing off the belly and Kate was upset, the bride's actions were within her rights to manage the photoshoot as she saw fit. The fact that Kate might be avoiding her could be due to her own sensitivity about the situation. The bride isn't obligated to prioritize someone else's desire to showcase their pregnancy over her own event's photography. Therefore, the bride isn't in the wrong here.\n"
