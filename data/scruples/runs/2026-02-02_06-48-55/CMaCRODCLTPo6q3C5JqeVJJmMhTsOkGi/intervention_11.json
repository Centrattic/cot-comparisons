Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the user says they paid a lot for the wedding photos and wanted them to be consistent with the other wedding party photos. Kate was holding her belly in a way that's obvious, similar to maternity shoot poses. The author asked her to stop, but now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nHmm. So, the author's perspective is that they wanted the photos to look like the wedding photos, not maternity pics, and they paid for that. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and she wanted to showcase it. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of Kate's pregnancy, even if unintentional. \n\nBut maybe the author had a right to request that the photos focus on the wedding. The author isn't trying to be mean, just ensuring the photos match their vision. However, is it reasonable to expect that a bridesmaid's pregnancy might be part of the photos? Maybe the author should have considered that Kate might feel proud of her pregnancy and wanted to include it. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The author asked Kate to stop, but maybe they didn't consider her feelings. If Kate felt her choice to show her belly was important, being asked to change her pose could make her feel embarrassed or excluded. \n\nBut the author did ask multiple times, which might be seen as polite correction rather than being rude. However, the aftermath shows that the author might not have been sensitive enough to Kate's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author had a legitimate desire for the photos to meet their expectations, but maybe they should have been more considerate of Kate's feelings. However, it's also possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to request how the photos are taken. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's request was respectful and if they considered Kate's perspective. If they just wanted the photos to look a certain way without considering Kate's feelings, maybe they are in the wrong. But if they were polite and it was a matter of the wedding photos, then maybe not. \n\nIn the end, the user is asking if they are the asshole, and the community might lean towards saying that the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to request the photos as they wanted. But others might say that they should have been more supportive of their pregnant bridesmaid. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author was within their rights to set the photo style, but maybe the execution could have been better. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Since the author's intentions were about the wedding photos and not to be malicious, the answer is B.\n"
