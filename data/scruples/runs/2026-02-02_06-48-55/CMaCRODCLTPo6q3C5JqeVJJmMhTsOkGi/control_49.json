Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a wedding three weeks ago. Kate is a bridesmaid who's 7 months pregnant. Her dress was flowy, so the belly could fit. During the photo session, Kate was holding her belly to make it more visible, like in maternity photos. The author asked her to stop and just pose normally. They had to remind her a few times. After the wedding, Kate didn't respond and seems upset. Another bridesmaid said Kate is mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the author was right to ask Kate not to show off her belly. Let's break down points.\n\nThe author's perspective: They paid for the wedding photos, not maternity shots. They wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not Kate's pregnancy. They might feel that the maternity poses were distracting or not appropriate for the wedding photos. Also, the author had to ask multiple times, which could indicate Kate wasn't heeding the request, leading to possible tension.\n\nKate's perspective: She's pregnant and might want to celebrate that milestone. She could feel that the author is being dismissive of her pregnancy, making her feel self-conscious. The other bridesmaid's comment that Kate is angry because the author was trying to make her look fat suggests that Kate felt the author was being insensitive or body-shaming.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Weddings are about the couple, so the photos are primarily about the wedding. It's reasonable for the author to have certain expectations for how the photos look. However, a bridesmaid's pregnancy is also a significant moment. The author's request to not show off the belly could be seen as a matter of preference, but if communicated in a harsh way, it might come off as rude.\n\nBut the author asked her to stop, which is their right. They might not want the focus to be on the bridesmaid's belly. However, Kate's reaction and the other bridesmaid's comment suggest that the author's actions were perceived as making Kate feel self-conscious. The author could have considered a compromise, like allowing the belly to be visible without posing to emphasize it. However, the author might not have realized that Kate wanted to showcase her pregnancy in the photos.\n\nAnother angle: Was the author's instruction reasonable? Since the dress was designed to accommodate the belly, maybe the author didn't want the photos to look like a maternity shoot. But Kate might have wanted to include her pregnancy as part of her presence at the event. The author could have communicated their preferences more clearly and with more sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they organized the wedding and photos, so they have some authority over the posing. However, the way they asked Kate could affect how it's received. If they were polite and explained their reasoning, maybe Kate would have understood. But if they came off as dismissive, that could be the issue.\n\nAlso, considering that Kate didn't respond and is now upset, the author might have hurt her feelings. The author might need to reflect on whether their request was about the wedding photos or about Kate's body image. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful of Kate's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to direct the photos to fit the wedding theme. However, their approach might have been insensitive. The answer depends on whether the request was made respectfully. Since the author had to ask multiple times and Kate felt targeted, it's possible the author should have been more considerate. But overall, the author's main point is about their own event's photos, so they might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
