Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, the author was the one who organized the wedding and paid for the photos. They wanted the photos to be about the wedding, not maternity shots. So, from their perspective, it's understandable they'd want the focus to stay on them and the ceremony, not on someone else's pregnancy. Kate was deliberately holding her belly to show it off, which the author didn't like. They asked her to stop, which led to some tension later.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a big life event and she wanted to celebrate it during the wedding photos. It's natural for someone to want to show off their body during a significant time, especially if it's a public event. The author's request could be seen as dismissive of Kate's feelings or her desire to share her pregnancy.\n\nBut the key points here are consent and respect. The author had the right to set boundaries for their own photos. They paid for the shoot, so it's their event. However, the way they handled it could have been more considerate. Maybe a private conversation before the event to discuss expectations would have been better than publicly calling her out during the photo session. That might have avoided hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and the author is now dealing with a strained relationship suggests that there's more to this. The author's insistence might have come off as harsh, especially if they didn't explain their reasoning for wanting the photos to focus on the wedding.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions were to maintain their vision for the wedding photos, which is valid. However, the approach taken might have been insensitive. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong, there's room for them to be more understanding of Kate's perspective. But given the context, the author's actions were within their rights to set the tone for their own event. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
