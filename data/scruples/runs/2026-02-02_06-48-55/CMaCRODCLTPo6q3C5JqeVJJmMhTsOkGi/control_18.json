Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author was the one who had the photos taken and paid for the professional shoot. They wanted the photos to be about the wedding, not a maternity shoot. Kate, being 7 months pregnant, was using the flowy dress to accentuate her belly, which the author found inappropriate. The author asked her to stop, and Kate was upset, leading to a lack of communication afterward.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel they have the right to control how the wedding photos look since they're paying for it. They might not want the focus to be on Kate's pregnancy during their special day. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her life and she wanted to celebrate that, especially if the dress allowed it. She might also feel that the author was dismissing her body or her experience.\n\nBut the key points here are that the author was clear in their request, and they were polite, reminding her a few times. Kate's reaction seems to be that she felt targeted or that her body was being criticized. However, the author's intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding. Since the author is paying for the photos, they have the right to dictate the style and focus of the shoot, as long as it's respectful. The author didn't force her to do anything, just asked her to pose like everyone else. \n\nAlso, considering that the dress had a flowy skirt, maybe Kate was making a point of showing off her belly. The author's request was to have everyone pose naturally, which is reasonable. There's a difference between naturally showing a belly due to the dress and actively holding it to accentuate. The author might have felt that the latter was drawing unnecessary attention. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, weddings are about the couple, so the author's stance is understandable. However, it's possible that Kate felt her personal experience was being overlooked. But the author isn't in the wrong for wanting the photos to reflect their own priorities. The real issue might be communication; maybe the author should have discussed it beforehand, but since they did ask politely and multiple times, it's not necessarily their fault. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to request how they wanted the photos taken, especially since they're paying for it. However, there's a nuance where they could have been more considerate, but the action itself isn't unethical or wrong.\n"
