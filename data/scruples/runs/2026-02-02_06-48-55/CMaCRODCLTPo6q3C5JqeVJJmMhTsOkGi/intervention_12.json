Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting a pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is the bride who had a wedding. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The bride's dress was flowy, so the belly was accommodated. During photos, Kate was holding her belly to make it more visible, which the bride asked her to stop doing. The bride had to remind her multiple times. After the wedding, Kate didn't respond, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe bride is now asking if she's the asshole. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the assistant's opinion.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the bride was wrong to ask Kate not to show off her belly in the photos. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, from the bride's perspective: She paid for the wedding photos, and she wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not on maternity shots. She might feel that the photos should look nice and not have unnecessary attention to Kate's belly. She asked Kate to stop, which could be seen as her right as the bride to direct the photos as she wants.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate's perspective: Being pregnant is a natural part of her life, and she might feel proud or excited to show off her belly. If she was doing it to celebrate her pregnancy, the bride's request might make her feel like she's being criticized or made to feel self-conscious. The other bridesmaid's comment suggests that Kate felt the bride was trying to make her look fat, which is a negative interpretation. However, the bride's intention was just to have the photos look as intended, not to be unkind.\n\nCultural and social norms: In some cultures, showing off a pregnant belly is a positive thing, but in a wedding context, the bride might want the photos to focus on the wedding attire and the event. However, it's also about respecting the bridesmaid's comfort and feelings.\n\nAlso, the bride had to remind Kate multiple times, which might indicate that Kate was persistent in showing her belly despite the bride's requests. This could be seen as Kate not respecting the bride's wishes, especially since the bride was the one paying for the photos and directing the shoot.\n\nBut maybe the bride could have approached it more sensitively. For example, explaining that she didn't want the photos to focus on the pregnancy, but rather on the wedding, and offering an alternative, like a separate maternity photo session. However, the bride's main point is that she wanted the photos to look good for the wedding, which is her priority.\n\nWas the bride in the wrong? It depends on how her actions were perceived. If she was being unkind or dismissive of Kate's situation, then maybe. But she just asked her to stop holding her belly to make the photos look better. There's no indication she was being cruel or malicious. The other bridesmaid's comment adds a layer of interpretation\u2014maybe Kate felt targeted. However, the bride's intention was to maintain the focus on the wedding, not to make Kate feel bad.\n\nIn conclusion, the bride was within her rights to direct the photos as she wanted. She's the one who paid for them and has the final say on the presentation. Kate's reaction might be overblown, but the bride could have handled it more gently. However, the main point is the bride's right to control the photo shoot. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
