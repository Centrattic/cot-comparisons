Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wanted the wedding photos to focus on the wedding, not on maternity shots. They asked the bridesmaid not to hold her belly in a way that was obvious, and had to remind her a few times. The author feels they paid for a wedding shoot, not maternity pics.\n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid might feel that the author was being insensitive, making her feel self-conscious about her pregnancy. Pregnancy can be a significant and positive moment, and showing it off in photos could be important to her. The author's actions might have been perceived as trying to hide her pregnancy, which could be hurtful.\n\nBut then again, the author is the one who organized the wedding and the photos. They have the right to decide how the photos look. The author might not have intended to be mean, just to have the photos fit the wedding theme. However, the way they handled it\u2014reminding multiple times\u2014could come off as harsh. Maybe they could have discussed it beforehand or offered a more supportive approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author's intention was just to keep the focus on the wedding, but their method made the bridesmaid feel disrespected, then maybe the author is at fault for not considering her feelings. However, if the author was firm but respectful, maybe the issue is more on the bridesmaid's side overreacting. But since the author is the one who had to stop the bridesmaid, it's possible they were the ones being inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key is whether the author's actions were necessary and respectful. Since the author had to repeatedly tell her to stop, it might have been rude. The author could have handled it more sensitively, like discussing the poses in advance or being more understanding. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
