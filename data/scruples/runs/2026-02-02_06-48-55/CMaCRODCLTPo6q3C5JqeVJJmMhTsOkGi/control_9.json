Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author was getting married and had a professional photoshoot arranged. They specifically asked Kate to stop holding her belly to avoid emphasizing it, which Kate took as a personal slight. The author's main point is that they wanted the photos to look like a wedding party, not a maternity shoot, and they had paid for the service.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate was pregnant and might have wanted to showcase her pregnancy, which is a natural and personal desire. The author's request could be seen as insensitive if they didn't consider Kate's feelings about her body during pregnancy. However, the author also has the right to decide how the photos should look, especially since they were paying for the service.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and social etiquette. In many weddings, the focus is on the couple and their wedding party. The author might not have wanted individual features to overshadow the main event. However, asking someone to not show their body in a natural state could be perceived as body-shaming, even if unintended.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author had to remind Kate multiple times, which might indicate that Kate was persistent in her actions, possibly not respecting the author's wishes. But the author's initial request was reasonable, especially if they wanted everyone to look their best in the photos.\n\nThe aftermath is also important. The author felt that Kate was avoiding them, and another bridesmaid confirmed that Kate was upset. This suggests that the author's actions hurt Kate's feelings, which could mean the author should have been more considerate.\n\nHowever, the author's stance is that the photos were for their wedding, and they had the right to direct how the photos looked. They might not have been aware of how their request would be received by Kate. There's a balance between personal preferences and respecting others' feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's request is understandable from a wedding planning perspective, the way it was handled might have been hurtful. They might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting the photos a certain way, but they could have communicated better or considered Kate's feelings more. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was the one making the request and Kate felt it was about making her look fat, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if their intentions were genuine and based on wanting the photos to reflect the wedding theme. But if the request was insensitive, then maybe they are. But considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), as the author had the right to direct the photoshoot as they wished, even if it caused unintended offense.\n"
