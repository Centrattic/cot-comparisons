Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was trying to show off her pregnant belly in the photos, and the author (the bride) asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset and the author is unsure if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride paid for the wedding photos, which are supposed to focus on the wedding party, not maternity shots. The author had to remind Kate multiple times to stop holding her belly. The other bridesmaid says Kate is upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of acknowledging her pregnancy.\n\nSo, from the bride's perspective, she might feel that the photos should be about the wedding, not about other people's pregnancies. She might have a right to request poses that fit the event's theme. On the other hand, Kate might feel her pregnancy is a significant part of her life right now and wanted to showcase it, which is understandable. However, the wedding is the main event here, and the bride has the final say on how the photos are taken since she's paying for it.\n\nBut was the author inconsiderate? Maybe she should have been more empathetic. However, the author did ask her to stop, which shows she was trying to maintain the focus on the wedding. It's possible that Kate took it personally, but the bride's primary responsibility is to her own event. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting the photos to look a certain way. The key point is that the bride paid for the photos and had the right to request poses that align with the wedding theme. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural or social expectation that the author overlooked. However, considering the bride's right to control the photography for her event, B seems correct.\n"
