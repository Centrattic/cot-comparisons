Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a bride who didn't let her pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos. The bride had to remind the bridesmaid a few times to stop holding her belly to make it obvious, and now the bridesmaid is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride might feel that the photos are for her wedding and she's paying for them, so she wants them to look like wedding photos, not maternity shots. She might not want the focus on the bridesmaid's pregnancy during the wedding. On the other hand, the bridesmaid might feel that she's pregnant and naturally wants to show that, especially if it's a significant part of her current life. The fact that the dress was flowy but the belly was still noticeable could add to the tension. The bride had to ask multiple times, which might come off as dismissive or rude to the bridesmaid.\n\nI should think about social norms and etiquette. In some cases, people might expect that a pregnant bridesmaid would want to show her belly, and the bride's insistence on not having that in the photos could be seen as insensitive. However, the bride is also within her rights to decide how the wedding photos look, especially since she's paying for the shoot. The key is whether the bride's actions were disrespectful. If she asked politely and explained her reasoning, maybe it's more understandable. But if she was dismissive or rude, that's an issue.\n\nThe other bridesmaid mentioned that Kate is mad because the bride was \"trying to make her look fat, not pregnant.\" That implies there's a perception that the bride was being critical of Kate's body, which is a sensitive issue. Even if the bride's intention was to have the photo look like a wedding, the way she communicated it could have been hurtful. It's possible that the bride didn't consider how her requests would affect Kate, especially if Kate was excited to show off her pregnancy.\n\nBut the bride's perspective is that she paid for the photos to be wedding-focused. She might not want the photos to be about other people's pregnancies. However, the fact that Kate was trying to show off her belly might be a natural reaction, especially in a maternity-themed way. The bride might not have considered Kate's feelings in asking her to stop each time. Repeated requests could be seen as nagging or not respecting Kate's comfort with her body.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. But the bride is the one who set the terms of the photoshoot, so she has some responsibility. If she had communicated her preferences in advance, maybe Kate wouldn't have tried to show off her belly. Alternatively, if the bride was firm but respectful, maybe Kate would have understood. The fact that the bride felt the need to ask multiple times might indicate that she didn't handle it well. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider the bridesmaid's feelings and her desire to share her pregnancy, even if the photoshoot was for the wedding. However, the bride also has the right to decide how the photos look. But given the outcome that the bridesmaid is upset and avoiding her, the author's actions likely hurt someone's feelings. So maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
