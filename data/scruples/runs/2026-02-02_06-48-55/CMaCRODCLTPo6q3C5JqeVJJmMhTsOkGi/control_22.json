Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing a pregnant bridesmaid to hold her belly in wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, who is the bride, noticed a bridesmaid (Kate) showing off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. The author asked Kate to stop doing that, but Kate got upset afterward. Now, the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, what factors are important here? The bride paid for the wedding photos, and she wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not maternity shots. That makes sense because the photos are part of the wedding album. However, Kate was pregnant, and the bride's request to not have her belly shown might be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, the bride has the right to decide how the photos are taken since it's her event and she's paying for it.\n\nKate's reaction: She became upset and avoided the bride. The other bridesmaid mentioned Kate was mad because the bride was trying to make her look fat. The bride's intention was to have the photos look good for the wedding, not maternity. But maybe the bride didn't consider that Kate wanted to celebrate her pregnancy. \n\nIs the bride in the wrong? Well, the bride had a right to set the tone for the photos. She didn't force Kate to show her belly; she asked her to stop. It was a polite request. However, the way it's framed could be seen as dismissive of Kate's feelings. The key here is whether the bride's request was reasonable. Since the photos are part of the wedding, it's reasonable to ask for a consistent look. \n\nOn the other side, if Kate felt that her pregnancy was being invalidated, that's a valid feeling. But the bride isn't obligated to prioritize someone else's desire to show their pregnancy over the wedding's visual consistency. The bride isn't being cruel, just setting boundaries for the event she's paying for. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The bride is within her rights to ask the bridesmaid to adjust her posing to fit the wedding photos. While it's important to be considerate, the bride isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the wedding's aesthetic over the maternity aspect.\n"
