Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was getting married, and one of her bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The author noticed that Kate was intentionally showing off her belly in the photos, similar to maternity photos. The author asked her to stop, and Kate is now upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's request to Kate during the photo shoot, the reason behind it (the author wanted wedding photos, not maternity shots), and the resulting fallout between them.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were reasonable. The author paid for a wedding photo shoot, which is meant to focus on the wedding party and the event itself. Having a bridesmaid's belly show prominently might distract from that. The author had to remind Kate multiple times, which could be seen as trying to maintain the intended focus of the photos.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and that the author was dismissive of that. Pregnancy can be a personal and sensitive topic, and not wanting to highlight it might be seen as not respecting her situation. However, the author's primary concern is the wedding photos, which she paid for. It's a balance between respecting the bride's wishes and the bridesmaid's feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the author was firm but polite, asking Kate to stop. It's possible that the author was considerate, not wanting to make Kate feel self-conscious, but rather to keep the photos focused. Kate's reaction could be due to feeling that her pregnancy wasn't acknowledged, but the author's intent was about the photos.\n\nAlso, considering communication. The author tried to reach out to Kate after the wedding, but Kate didn't respond. The other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is upset. The author might not have considered how her request affected Kate emotionally, but she might not have intended to be insensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's main point is about the photos being for the wedding, not maternity shots. She was clear in her requests and didn't force Kate to do anything. While Kate's feelings are hurt, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she had the right to direct the photoshoot as she saw fit. However, maybe there's room for empathy here. But based on the information given, the author's actions were justified. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
