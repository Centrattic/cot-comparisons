Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was showing off her pregnant belly during photos, and the bride (the author) asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author paid for professional photos of the wedding party and wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. They had to remind her several times to stop holding her belly. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a natural part of her body and that the bride was being insensitive by not allowing her to show it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted the photos to look good and not be maternity shots. But Kate might see it as the bride trying to hide her pregnancy, which could be hurtful. The key points here are the author's right to direct the photos to their liking versus Kate's right to express her body as she chooses. \n\nI think the author has a valid reason to want the photos to be about the wedding. However, the way they handled it might have been a bit harsh. Instead of just telling Kate to stop, maybe the author could have had a conversation beforehand to set expectations. But in the moment, during a photoshoot, it's reasonable to correct someone's pose if it's not what you wanted. \n\nOn the flip side, Kate might have felt that her body was being policed, especially since showing her belly is a common way to celebrate pregnancy. The fact that the author had to remind her multiple times could have been seen as dismissive or rude. However, considering the context of the wedding photos, the author isn't obligated to include maternity elements. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by not allowing Kate to show her belly. But since the author is the one who paid for the photos and is the central figure of the event, they have some right to direct how the photos look. However, it's also possible that the author should have been more considerate of Kate's feelings. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the authority over the photos they paid for. But there's a middle ground where being more communicative could have helped. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
