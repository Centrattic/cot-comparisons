Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her pregnant bridesmaid to hold her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted her wedding photos to look a certain way, and she asked Kate to stop showing her belly. On the other hand, Kate might feel that the author was being insensitive, trying to hide her pregnancy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots. That makes sense because she might have specific visions for the photos. However, Kate's perspective is that she was trying to show off her pregnancy, which is a natural and happy part of her life. The author's repeated reminders could have come across as dismissive or hurtful, even if unintentional.\n\nI should also think about the context. Kate was a bridesmaid, so her role is to support the bride. But she's also pregnant, which is a significant life event. The author's request might be about maintaining the aesthetic, but maybe she didn't consider Kate's feelings. The fact that Kate is now upset and avoiding the author suggests that the author's actions had a negative impact on their friendship.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have realized that showing the belly wasn't about looking fat, but about announcing the pregnancy. Maybe the author didn't consider that Kate wanted to share the joy of her pregnancy during the wedding. The author's insistence on stopping it could be seen as prioritizing her own aesthetic over Kate's personal joy.\n\nOn the flip side, the author has the right to control the photos of her wedding. It's her event, after all. But it's a balance between personal preference and being considerate of others' feelings. The key here is whether the author was overstepping by repeatedly telling Kate to stop, even if it's her own event.\n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and how it was communicated. If the author was polite and explained it was for the photos, maybe it's not her fault. But if she was dismissive or unkind, then maybe she's in the wrong. The fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid says Kate thinks the author was trying to make her look fat suggests that the author's actions were perceived as negative. So, the author might be in the wrong here because she didn't consider Kate's feelings and the importance of showing her pregnancy. So, answer A.\n"
