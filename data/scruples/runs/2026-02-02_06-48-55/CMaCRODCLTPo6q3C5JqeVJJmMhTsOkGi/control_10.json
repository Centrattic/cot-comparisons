Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing a pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is the bride who paid for a wedding photo shoot. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, was 7 months pregnant and kept positioning her hands to show her belly in the photos. The bride asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The question is whether the bride did the wrong thing.\n\nI need to consider the context. The wedding photos are about the bride's big day, and she hired a photographer for that specific event. The bride's main concern is that the photos focus on her and her wedding attire, not on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. The dress was flowy and could accommodate the pregnancy, so the belly wasn't an issue in the fabric. However, the bridesmaid was deliberately holding her belly to highlight it, which the bride found inappropriate for the photoshoot.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her body and her pregnancy are valid to show, especially since it's a natural part of her body. The bride's request could be seen as dismissing Kate's pregnancy or making her feel self-conscious. However, the bride has the right to control how her wedding photos are taken since she's paying for them. She wanted a certain aesthetic, and if Kate's actions were distracting from that, the bride's instructions make sense.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's authority over the photoshoot and the bridesmaid's feelings. The bride isn't in the wrong if she's asserting control over her event. However, there's a balance. If the bride's actions were cruel or disrespectful, that could be a problem. But in this case, she asked Kate to stop in a professional setting, which is reasonable. Kate might have overstepped by deliberately trying to show off her belly instead of following the photographer's and bride's direction.\n\nSo, considering all this, the bride isn't in the wrong. She had the right to request the bridesmaid to pose appropriately for the photos. The answer should be B (No).\n"
