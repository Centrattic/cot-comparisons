Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a bride who told her pregnant bridesmaid not to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The bride had to remind her multiple times, and now the bridesmaid is upset, thinking the bride didn't want to acknowledge her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride paid for a wedding photoshoot, so she might want the focus to be on the wedding itself, not on other people's pregnancies. On the other hand, the bridesmaid might feel that the bride was being insensitive by not allowing her to show her pregnancy, which is a significant life event. \n\nThe bride's reasoning is that she wanted the photos to look good and not have maternity shots. But maybe the bridesmaid felt that the bride was making her feel self-conscious or not supportive. The bride had to remind her multiple times, which could come off as being dismissive or rude, even if her intention was just to keep the photos focused on the wedding.\n\nAlso, the fact that the bridesmaid is now avoiding her suggests that the bride's actions hurt her feelings. Even if the bride's intention wasn't to be mean, the way she handled it might have been inconsiderate. Maybe there was a better way to address the situation, like discussing it privately rather than repeatedly asking in front of others. \n\nBut then again, the bride is within her rights to set the tone for her own wedding photos. However, there's a balance between maintaining the event's focus and being considerate of others' feelings. The key here is whether the bride's actions were unnecessarily hurtful. If she was polite and explained her reasoning, maybe it's different. But from the way it's written, she just kept asking her to stop, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't handle the situation sensitively, even if her intentions were to keep the focus on the wedding. It's important to be considerate of others' feelings and perhaps find a middle ground, like allowing some natural posing without forcing it.\n"
