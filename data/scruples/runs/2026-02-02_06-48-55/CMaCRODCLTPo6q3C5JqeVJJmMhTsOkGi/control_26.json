Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the author explains that during the wedding photos, Kate was intentionally holding her belly to make it prominent. The author asked her to stop and pose like everyone else, and had to remind her multiple times. Now, Kate is upset, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that they wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not on maternity shots. They paid for a wedding photo shoot, so they might feel it's their right to decide how the photos are taken. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and that the author was being insensitive by not allowing her to celebrate that moment.\n\nBut, the key here is that the author was the one hosting the wedding and paying for the photos. As the primary subject of the wedding, they have the right to set the tone and style of the photos. Kate is a guest and a bridesmaid, so her role is to support the bride. The author's request was reasonable to maintain consistency in the photos. It's also possible that Kate overstepped by making a deliberate effort to draw attention to her belly, which could make others uncomfortable or distract from the wedding's focus. \n\nThe author's actions were polite (asking her to stop) and not hostile. There's no indication of rudeness or intent to harm. The fact that Kate is now upset might be more about her own feelings about her pregnancy not being acknowledged, but the author isn't obligated to include that in the wedding photos. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to decide the focus of their own wedding photos. Kate might be upset, but the author acted within their rights.\n"
