Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the bride) is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the bride wanted to take wedding photos, not maternity ones. She had to remind Kate a few times to stop holding her belly to make it obvious. The bride paid a lot for the photos and didn't want them to focus on Kate's pregnancy. Now, Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat.\n\nSo, is the bride wrong? Well, from her perspective, she organized the wedding and paid for the photos. She might feel the photos should be about the wedding, not individual features. But Kate, being pregnant, might feel she was trying to draw attention to her pregnancy, which is a natural thing to want in a photo. The bride asked her to stop, which could be seen as dismissive of Kate's feelings or her pregnancy.\n\nBut the bride's reasoning is that the photos were for the wedding, not maternity. She didn't want the focus to be on one person's pregnancy. However, maybe she could have been more considerate in her approach. Instead of just telling Kate to stop, maybe she could have discussed the photo plan beforehand or chosen a different angle that respected both the wedding theme and Kate's desire to show her pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might have assumed it was okay to pose that way, especially since her dress allowed it. The bride's repeated requests might have made Kate feel embarrassed or not supported. The bride's actions could come off as insensitive, even if her intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the bride's intention was valid, but her approach might have been harsh. She could have been more empathetic and communicative. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but she could have handled it better. However, some might argue she should have been more understanding of Kate's feelings. Hmm, tricky.\n"
