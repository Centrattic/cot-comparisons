Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where the bride (the author) didn't allow her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wanted the wedding photos to focus on the wedding, not on maternity shots. She had to remind Kate a few times to stop showing her belly. After the wedding, Kate became distant, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nOn one hand, the author paid for a wedding photoshoot and might have a right to decide how the photos look. She didn't want maternity shots, so asking Kate to pose normally could be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a natural part of her body and that the author was being dismissive or critical of her body. Maybe Kate felt humiliated or that her body wasn't respected. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. In weddings, the focus is on the couple and the event. However, bridesmaids might have their own feelings about how they're portrayed. The author's intention was to have standard wedding photos, but Kate might feel that the author was being judgmental. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to accommodate Kate's desire to show her belly, even if it's not part of the wedding's main theme? Or does the author have the right to control the aesthetic of her own wedding photos? \n\nAlso, the fact that Kate became distant and upset suggests that the author's actions hurt her feelings. Maybe the author could have approached it more sensitively, like discussing the poses beforehand rather than during the shoot. But the author's main point is that she paid for the photos to be wedding-focused, not maternity, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, there's a balance between the bride's wishes for her wedding and the bridesmaid's personal feelings about her body. If the author was not being hostile and was just maintaining the theme, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if she was being overly critical or dismissive of Kate's feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on how the author handled the situation. Since she had to remind Kate multiple times, maybe she was insistent, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the main goal was the wedding photos, so maybe she's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
