Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She paid for professional wedding photos and wanted the focus to be on her wedding, not on maternity shots. She had to remind Kate multiple times to stop holding her belly to make it obvious. The author might feel that the wedding photos should be about the wedding party and not individual features, even if it's a pregnancy. She also mentions that the dress was flowy and the belly was already visible in the fabric, so maybe she didn't want it emphasized further.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate felt offended and was upset. Pregnancy is a personal and significant aspect of someone's life, and maybe Kate felt it was important to showcase her pregnancy in the photos. The fact that another bridesmaid confirmed Kate's anger suggests that the author's actions might have been seen as dismissive or disrespectful towards Kate's pregnancy.\n\nBut then again, the author did ask politely and was trying to maintain consistency in the photos. The question is whether the author overstepped by not allowing Kate to show her belly. Considering that Kate's belly was already visible in the dress, the author might have been trying to avoid making it a focal point, which could be seen as her right since it's her wedding. However, if Kate wanted to emphasize her pregnancy, the author's refusal could be perceived as not respecting Kate's wishes, even if the author had her own reasons.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the author had discussed the photo style with Kate beforehand, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since the author unilaterally decided during the shoot, it might have come off as dismissive. However, the author's main event was her wedding, and she had the right to direct how the photos were taken, especially since she paid for the shoot. \n\nI think the balance here is tricky. The author isn't entirely wrong because it's her event and her money. But she might have handled it more sensitively. Since Kate wanted to show her belly and the author didn't, it's a clash of preferences. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions were considerate enough. Maybe the author could have considered that Kate wanted to celebrate her pregnancy, but she also has the right to have photos that focus on the wedding. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but she could have approached it differently. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she could have done better. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (No) because the author was within her rights to direct the photos as she wanted. However, it's a close call. But considering that Kate was a bridesmaid and the author is the one who organized the event, the author isn't in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
