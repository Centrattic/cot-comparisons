Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a bridesmaid who was pregnant and wanted to show off her belly in the wedding photos. The author told her to stop doing that, and now the bridesmaid is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one who organized the wedding and paid for the photos. They wanted the photos to look good, focusing on the wedding party, not maternity shots. The bridesmaid, Kate, was being deliberate about showing her belly, which the author didn't like. The author asked her to stop, and Kate is now upset, feeling targeted.\n\nI need to assess if the author was wrong. On one hand, the author has the right to decide how the wedding photos should look. They paid for the photos and might not want them to focus too much on one person's pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate might feel her feelings were disregarded, especially since she's pregnant, and the author's actions could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut the key points here are: the author gave instructions during the photoshoot, which is their right as the person paying. They asked Kate to stop showing her belly, which could be seen as a reasonable request to maintain the intended focus of the photos. However, the author might not have considered Kate's feelings or the significance of the pregnancy to her. Kate might want to share her pregnancy, especially publicly, and the author's insistence could be perceived as dismissive.\n\nBut the author's main argument is that they wanted professional wedding photos, not maternity pictures. They were clear with their request, and Kate was told multiple times. The author didn't say anything about the pregnancy itself but about the pose affecting the photos. So, it's about the photoshoot's purpose. \n\nHowever, the bridesmaid's perspective is that the author was trying to make her look fat. That's a possible miscommunication. The author's intent was to have the photos look good, but the action could be seen as targeting Kate's body. The author might not have considered Kate's desire to celebrate her pregnancy publicly in the wedding photos. \n\nBut ultimately, the author is the one who paid for the photos and has the right to direct how they are taken. It's their event, so they have the authority to make such requests. Unless there was prior agreement that the pregnant bridesmaid would be featured in that way, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way the author handled it could be improved\u2014maybe a more empathetic approach, but the action of asking her to pose differently isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, considering the arguments, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They have the right to direct the photoshoot as they see fit. But some might argue sensitivity is lacking. However, the main point is the author's right to control the event they paid for.\n"
