Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who didn't let their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the wedding photos is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a bride who had a wedding photoshoot. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, was around 7 months pregnant. The dress had a flowy skirt, so the belly was visible. Kate was holding her stomach to make it more obvious in the photos, like in maternity shoots. The author told her to stop, which she did after a few reminders. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author didn't want to acknowledge her pregnancy, and others say that's how Kate feels.\n\nThe author is confused because they paid for a wedding shoot, not maternity photos, so they wanted the focus on the wedding. But Kate might feel her pregnancy was being downplayed. So the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nHmm. Well, the author had the right to decide how the photos should look. The wedding was their event, and the photos were part of that. If Kate was deliberately posturing to show her belly, which the author didn't want, the author could reasonably ask her to adjust. However, maybe there was a miscommunication. The author didn't intend to be harsh, just to have the photos look like a wedding. But Kate might feel her body or her pregnancy was being judged or hidden.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is paying for the photos, and the purpose is the wedding, not a maternity shoot. So maybe the author isn't wrong. However, perhaps the author could have been more considerate in their approach. Like, maybe explaining why they wanted her to pose differently, instead of just asking her to stop. But the key is that the author had the right to make the photos look a certain way. Kate might have felt her needs weren't considered, but the author's request was within their rights.\n\nAlso, Kate's reaction seems a bit out of proportion. The author didn't prevent her from being pregnant; they just wanted the photos to focus on the wedding. Maybe Kate took it personally, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to direct the photos to fit the wedding theme.\n"
