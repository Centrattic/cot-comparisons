Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not letting her bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author was the bride, and Kate, the bridesmaid, was 7 months pregnant. The bride noticed Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The author asked her to stop, and later found out Kate was upset about it. The bride feels she paid for a wedding shoot, not maternity photos, but is now worried she was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overstep by asking Kate to not show her belly? Was the author's reaction reasonable or was she being insensitive?\n\nWell, Kate was a bridesmaid, and the wedding photos are about the bride and groom. The author might have felt that the focus should be on the wedding party, not on Kate's pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her body and pregnancy are natural and she shouldn't have to hide them, especially since it's a significant life event.\n\nThe bride's main argument is that she paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. That's a valid point because the primary purpose is the wedding. However, Kate's perspective is about bodily autonomy. The bride is asking someone else how to pose, which could be seen as controlling how another person's body is presented.\n\nBut in a wedding context, the bride often has the final say on how the photos look. The other bridesmaids are expected to comply with the bride's wishes for the photos. So, the bride asking Kate to pose like everyone else isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she handled it might matter. If she was rude or dismissive, that could be an issue. The story doesn't mention that, though. It just says she asked a few times.\n\nAnother angle: pregnancy is a natural part of life, and hiding it might make Kate feel uncomfortable or that her experience isn't respected. But the bride's main event is the wedding, and she has the right to direct the photos to reflect her vision. \n\nSo, the question is whether the bride's action was wrong. If the bride's instructions were reasonable and part of the wedding planning, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she was making Kate feel embarrassed or not respected, that's different. The story doesn't indicate that the bride was malicious. She might have just wanted consistent photos.\n\nIn conclusion, the bride's request was about maintaining the focus on the wedding, which is her right. While Kate might feel upset, the bride isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries on the photos. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
