Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's bridesmaid, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The author had a wedding photoshoot with the wedding party. Kate kept holding her belly to show it off, and the author asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The question is whether the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's main point is that she paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pictures. She wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not Kate's pregnancy. But Kate felt it was important to show her pregnancy, maybe as a personal milestone or because she felt it was a natural part of her body during the shoot. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about the purpose of the photos. She might be concerned that having Kate's belly prominent in the photos could distract from the wedding theme, or she might not want the photos to look like maternity shoots. She also had to remind Kate multiple times, which could indicate that Kate wasn't respecting her requests.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity right now, and being asked to hide it could be seen as invalidating or making her feel uncomfortable. The other bridesmaid mentioned that Kate is upset because she thinks the author was trying to make her look fat. That's a loaded statement, implying the author had a negative intention.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is the one paying for the photos and organizing the event. It's her wedding, so she's in charge of how the photos are taken. However, Kate is a close friend (bridesmaid), so there's a personal relationship involved. The author's request to pose normally might have been to maintain the aesthetic of the wedding photos, but it's possible Kate interpreted it as a personal attack.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had a right to set the tone for the photoshoot as part of her wedding. If Kate was deliberately drawing attention to her belly, maybe the author was within her rights to ask her to stop. However, the way she did it might have been insensitive. Did she consider Kate's feelings or explain the reason behind the request? If the author only focused on the aesthetic without acknowledging Kate's feelings, that could be a problem. But if the author was clear that it was about the photos' purpose, then it's more about the author's right to decide.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid confirmed it suggests that the author's actions might have been hurtful. But the author's main argument is that she's not responsible for maternity photos. So, the question is whether the author overstepped by not allowing Kate to express her pregnancy in the photos, or if she was justified in keeping the focus on the wedding.\n\nIn similar situations, people often have different perspectives. Some might side with the author because it's her event and photos, others with Kate because it's about personal expression. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. If the author had a valid reason (like the photos being for the wedding) and communicated it respectfully, maybe she's not wrong. But if she dismissed Kate's feelings without understanding, she might be.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The answer hinges on intent and communication. The author's actions were to stop Kate from showing off her belly, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's intent was about the photos. The assistant has to decide based on the information given. Since the author is the one who paid and organized, and the request was about the photos, maybe she's in the right. But if Kate felt humiliated, maybe she's not. The other bridesmaid's comment that Kate thinks the author was trying to make her look fat adds a layer of possible miscommunication or perceived insensitivity.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to decide how the wedding photos are taken. However, she could have handled it more sensitively. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's not about Kate's pregnancy but about the purpose of the photos. So, the answer is B.\n"
