Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a bridesmaid who was pregnant and tried to show off her belly in the wedding photos, but the bride kept asking her to stop. The bride now feels the bridesmaid is upset with her, and the question is whether the bride is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride's perspective: she paid for a wedding photoshoot, and she wanted the photos to look good, not like a maternity shoot. She had to remind the bridesmaid multiple times. On the other hand, the bridesmaid might feel that the bride was being insensitive, trying to hide her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her body. \n\nPregnancy is a significant life event, and showing off the belly is often seen as something the expectant mother wants to celebrate. But the bride's wedding day is also a big deal, and she might not want her photos to focus on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. However, the key point is whether the bride acted unkindly or inconsiderately. \n\nIf the bride approached it politely and explained that the focus was on the wedding, then it might be reasonable. But if she was harsh or made the bridesmaid feel ashamed, that's different. The story mentions the bride had to remind her a few times, which might come off as being strict. Also, the bridesmaid might feel her body is being policed. \n\nHowever, the bride is the one who is the main subject of the photos, so it's her prerogative to have the photos represent the wedding. That said, there's a balance. Maybe the bride could have been more understanding, allowing the belly to be shown naturally without it being forced. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and hurt feelings. The bride's intent was to have wedding photos, not maternity shots. The bridesmaid's intent was to celebrate her pregnancy. The bride's actions, while firm, might not be malicious. But the bridesmaid's reaction could be valid if she felt disrespected. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because it's her wedding, and she has the right to decide how the photos look. The bridesmaid's behavior might have been overstepping by deliberately trying to show off her belly in a way that's not natural. The bride's reminders were necessary. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
