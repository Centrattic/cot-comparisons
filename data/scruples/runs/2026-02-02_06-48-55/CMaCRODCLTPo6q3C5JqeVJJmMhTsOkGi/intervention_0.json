Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had a wedding and hired a professional photographer. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. Her dress was designed to accommodate her belly, but during the photo sessions, she was intentionally holding her belly to make it more obvious. The author intervened, asking her to stop and pose normally. This led to tension, and Kate now seems upset, feeling the author was trying to hide her pregnancy instead of celebrating it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about the photoshoot being for the wedding, not maternity shots. They probably wanted all the photos to look cohesive and focused on the wedding itself. They paid for professional photos, so they might have wanted them to look their best without any elements that could distract from the main event.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate was pregnant, and showing her belly is a natural part of her body during this time. If the dress was already accommodating, maybe she felt it was okay or even good to highlight her pregnancy as a positive part of her life. She might have wanted to celebrate her own milestone in the special day, which is understandable. The author's repeated reminders could have been perceived as dismissive or critical, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Weddings are about the couple, but they also include close friends and family. The author has the right to direct how the photos look, especially since they paid for the service. However, the way they handled it might have been insensitive. Maybe they could have discussed it beforehand or approached it more gently. Forcing a pregnant person not to display their body as they choose could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the dress allows it naturally.\n\nBut the author's main point is about the photoshoot's purpose. They might not want to have photos that focus more on Kate's pregnancy than the wedding itself. It's a balance between respecting the bride's wishes and the bridesmaid's comfort.\n\nI think the key here is intent. If the author was trying to maintain the wedding photo's focus and not create a maternity photo session, that's reasonable. However, the method of stopping Kate might have been abrupt, leading to hurt feelings. The author could have communicated better, maybe by discussing the photo style before the event or offering an alternative pose that still included her pregnancy in a way that fits the wedding theme.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting the photos to look a certain way. However, they might have handled the situation more sensitively. The bridesmaid's feelings are valid too, so there's a shared responsibility. But according to the question, it's asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author made a reasonable request that didn't harm Kate's well-being but focused on the wedding's presentation, it's more of a B (not in the wrong). However, there's room for improvement in communication and consideration.\n"
