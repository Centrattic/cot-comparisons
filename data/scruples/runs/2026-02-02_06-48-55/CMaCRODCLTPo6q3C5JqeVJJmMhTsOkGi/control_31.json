Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where one of the bridesmaids, Kate, was around seven months pregnant. The author (bride) had to ask her to stop showing off her belly in the photos. The bride now feels that Kate is upset with her, and others think the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The question is whether the bride is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride paid for a wedding photo shoot, so she might be focused on the aesthetic of the photos for the wedding. Kate was deliberately holding her belly to show it off, which the bride asked her to stop. The bride had to remind her multiple times. Now, Kate is upset, and others are saying the bride was being unfair.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she paid for the photos to be wedding-related. If the bridesmaid was intentionally making her belly more visible, the bride might feel it's not in line with the wedding photos' purpose. The bride has a right to request how the photos are taken, especially since she's paying for it. However, it's also important to consider Kate's feelings. Being pregnant is a significant life event, and not being allowed to show her belly might make her feel unacknowledged or embarrassed.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The bride asked Kate to stop multiple times, which shows she was trying to correct the situation. However, maybe the bride didn't consider the feelings of the bridesmaid beforehand. But the bride's main responsibility here is to her own event and the photos she paid for. She's not obligated to accommodate a specific request that wasn't discussed beforehand. It's possible that the bride handled it a bit abruptly, but given that she had to remind her, it's more about enforcement of her preferences rather than an initial mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a valid part of her identity and that the bride was trying to hide it. But the bride's priority is the wedding photos, which are for her and her wedding party. It's a bit of a clash between personal preference and another's comfort. However, the bride did try to address the issue by asking Kate multiple times, which shows she was aware of the problem and attempted to resolve it.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She had a legitimate reason to want the photos to look a certain way. The issue might be more about how Kate is reacting, but the bride's actions were within her rights. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
