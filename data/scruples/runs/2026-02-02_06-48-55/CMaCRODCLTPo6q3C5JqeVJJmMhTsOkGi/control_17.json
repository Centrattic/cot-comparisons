Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing a pregnant bridesmaid to show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author had a wedding and wanted professional photos. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is pregnant and was holding her belly to show it off in the photos. The author asked her to stop, which led to a conflict. Now, Kate is upset because she felt the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they paid for wedding photos, not maternity shoots. The main focus should be on the wedding, not the pregnancy. They probably wanted all the bridesmaids to look similar in the photos, maintaining a cohesive look. The author might have felt that the attention on the belly was unnecessary and distracting from the main event.\n\nOn Kate's side, being pregnant is a significant life event, and she might have wanted to celebrate and showcase that. The author's request could have been perceived as dismissive or critical of her pregnancy, even if that wasn't the intention. The way the author had to remind her multiple times might have made Kate feel embarrassed or singled out. The fact that Kate is now avoiding the author suggests that the author's actions hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. It's common for wedding photos to focus on the couple and the wedding party, maintaining a certain aesthetic. However, guests might have their own feelings about how they want to present themselves. The author's request was to have everyone pose similarly, which is reasonable for a cohesive photo. But the way it was handled could be an issue. If the author approached it in a polite and considerate manner, it might have been less hurtful. However, if it came across as dismissive or critical, that could be where the problem lies.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author felt the need to remind her multiple times might have been frustrating for Kate. It's possible that the author didn't consider that Kate's desire to show her belly was important to her, and thus the author's insistence might have been insensitive.\n\nIn terms of the payment for the photos, the author is justified in wanting the photos to reflect the wedding event as they envisioned. However, the conflict arises from the balance between the author's vision and the bridesmaid's personal feelings. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. If the author's intentions were purely to maintain the photo's aesthetic and had no intention to offend, they might not be in the wrong. But the effect was that Kate felt disrespected, which could mean the author is at least partially responsible for not considering Kate's feelings.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author could have discussed the photo style in advance with the bridesmaids, including Kate, to set expectations. If they hadn't communicated this, and then made the request during the shoot, that could be seen as a misstep. However, the author might not have anticipated this issue until they saw it happening.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to have professional wedding photos, the way they handled Kate's actions might have been insensitive. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a right to their vision for the photos, but they could have been more considerate of Kate's feelings. However, the fact that Kate took offense and the author had to remind her multiple times suggests that the author's actions were not the best approach. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but perhaps there's a nuance. Alternatively, some might argue the author was inconsiderate, making them at least partially at fault. But given the information, the author's main point is about maintaining the photos as a wedding event, so B might be the answer.\n"
