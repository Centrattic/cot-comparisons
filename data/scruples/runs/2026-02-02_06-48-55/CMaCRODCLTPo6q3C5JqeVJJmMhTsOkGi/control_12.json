Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was showing off her pregnant belly in the photos, and the bride asked her to stop. The bride now feels like Kate is avoiding her and others have confirmed that Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The bride is paying for the wedding photos and wants them to focus on the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She's the one paying for the photos and wants them to reflect her wedding as the main event. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries regarding how the photos are taken. Kate, on the other hand, might feel that showing her pregnancy is a natural part of her identity and wants to celebrate that moment. However, the bride probably has the right to decide how the wedding photos are presented. \n\nI should think about consent and communication. The bride did ask Kate to not show off her belly, and Kate continued despite the requests. The bride had to remind her multiple times, which might indicate that Kate wasn't respecting her wishes. The bride isn't trying to be mean, just ensuring her photos are as intended. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship between the two, if they were close friends, maybe Kate felt hurt, but the bride's actions were within her rights as the one organizing the event. The key point is that the bride is the one paying for the service and has the authority over the photography. So, while Kate's feelings are valid, the bride isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
