Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a bride who didn't let her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. Kate was about 7 months pregnant, and her dress was flowy with a fitted bust, so the belly was accommodated. The author noticed Kate holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos and asked her to stop, reminding her a few times. After the wedding, Kate didn't talk to the author, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author is now wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that she paid for wedding photos, not maternity ones. She wanted consistent photos with the wedding party, not focusing on Kate's pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant life event and wanted to celebrate that in the photos. The author's request to not show the belly could be seen as dismissive or making her feel self-conscious. However, the author had to remind her multiple times, which might indicate that Kate was intentionally trying to show off, which the author didn't want. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize the wedding photos over Kate's desire to show her pregnancy? Maybe, but it's a personal choice. The author had the right to set the tone for the photos. However, the way Kate is reacting might be about feeling humiliated or not respected. The author could have considered a compromise, like allowing some photos where the belly is shown if it's natural. But the author was firm in her request, so maybe she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe she was too strict, not considering Kate's feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. Since the author asked politely and had to remind her, maybe she's not the asshole. Kate's reaction could be overblown, but the author could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she had the right to decide the photo style, and Kate was being intentional in showing her belly, the author might not be wrong. Answer B.\n"
