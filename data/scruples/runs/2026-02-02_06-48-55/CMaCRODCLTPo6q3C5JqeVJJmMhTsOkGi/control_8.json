Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author was the one who decided the photo shoot was for the wedding, not maternity shots. She paid for the professional photos and wanted everyone to pose naturally. Kate was being obvious with her hands on her belly to highlight the pregnancy. The author asked her to stop, but Kate was upset about it after.\n\nI need to consider the perspectives. The author might feel that the wedding photos should focus on the wedding party and not make any single person's feature stand out, especially if it's not relevant to the event. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and that being asked to hide it was disrespectful.\n\nBut the author did ask Kate to stop, and Kate took it as a personal slight. The other bridesmaid mentioned that Kate is angry because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The author's intention was probably to have cohesive photos, not to single out Kate. However, the way it was handled might have been sensitive. The author could have considered Kate's feelings better, maybe by discussing the photo style beforehand or finding a way to include the pregnancy if it was important to Kate.\n\nBut ultimately, the author had the right to set the tone for the photos since it was her wedding. She wasn't being mean-spirited, just trying to maintain the intended focus of the photos. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But there's a middle ground here. The author could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she could have handled it better. Since Kate's intention was to show off her belly, which the author didn't want in the wedding photos, the author's actions were within her rights. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
