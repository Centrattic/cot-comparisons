Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author was the bride, and they had specific photos in mind for their wedding. The bridesmaid, Kate, was 7 months pregnant and was using her hands to accentuate her belly in the photos. The bride asked her to stop, and later Kate seemed upset about it. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the bride's right to direct the photoshoot as they see fit since they paid for it. The author had a vision for the wedding photos, which probably included everyone looking a certain way. Kate's actions might have been trying to highlight her pregnancy, which the bride felt was detracting from the main event. \n\nBut then there's the consideration of Kate's feelings. She might have felt her body was being policed or that the bride was making her feel self-conscious. However, the author did ask politely and multiple times, which shows they tried to address it without being confrontational. \n\nThe other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is upset because the author was trying to make her look fat. That's a sensitive issue, but the author's intention was likely to keep the focus on the wedding, not on individual features. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting the photos to align with their vision. They can't be expected to accommodate every personal desire of guests, especially when it's against their own wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, allowing Kate to pose naturally without emphasizing the belly. But the author did ask her to pose like everyone else, which is reasonable. The bride's priority is their own wedding photos, which they paid for. So, while Kate might feel hurt, the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
