Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the wedding story did something wrong by not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the photos.\n\nSo, the author's main point is that they wanted the wedding photos to focus on the wedding party and not on maternity shots. Kate, the bridesmaid, was trying to hold her belly to make it more visible in the pictures. The author asked her to stop, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They paid for a wedding photo shoot, which is their event, and they have the right to decide how they want the photos to look. The author didn't prohibit Kate from being in the photos; they just asked her to pose normally like the others. It's their wedding, so their preferences should take precedence. \n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity, and not being allowed to show her belly could make her feel excluded or not respected. However, the author's request was to pose like everyone else, which is a reasonable expectation for a group photo. It's possible that Kate took it as a personal slight, but the author's intention was to maintain the aesthetic of the wedding photos, not to criticize her body.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author had to remind Kate a few times, which could be seen as being firm but not rude. The fact that they asked politely and gave multiple reminders suggests they wanted to be accommodating but firm about their preference. \n\nThe other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is upset about being made to look fat, but the author's reasoning was about the photos being a wedding shoot, not maternity shots. The author isn't trying to hide Kate's pregnancy but wants the focus to remain on the wedding itself.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions were within their rights as the host of the event. They have control over how the photos are taken, and their request was respectful. Kate's reaction seems to stem from a misunderstanding or taking the request personally, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for their own event.\n"
