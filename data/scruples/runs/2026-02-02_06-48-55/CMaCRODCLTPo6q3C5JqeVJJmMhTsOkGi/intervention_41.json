Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was pregnant and kept showing off her belly in the photos. The author told her to stop, and now Kate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author paid for wedding photos and wanted them to focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. That makes sense. On the other hand, Kate was probably excited about her pregnancy and wanted to share that joy, especially as a bridesmaid who's close to the bride. Maybe she felt it was a natural part of her current identity to include it in the photos.\n\nThe author did ask her to stop, but maybe the way it was done was harsh? The key here is intent. The author didn't want maternity photos, but maybe didn't consider Kate's feelings. However, the author also had the right to decide how the photos should look for their wedding. It's a balance between personal preference and being considerate.\n\nThe bridesmaid's perspective is that the author was trying to make her look fat, which could be a sensitive issue. But the author's intention wasn't to criticize her weight, just to have standard wedding photos. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were standing up for their own wishes. But could there have been a more tactful way to handle it? Perhaps the author could have discussed it beforehand or found a compromise, like having a separate photo with the belly. However, the author might not have known about Kate's feelings beforehand.\n\nAlso, after the fact, the author could have apologized if they realized it was a sensitive topic. But the author's main point is about the photos being for the wedding, not maternity. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The question is whether the action itself was wrong. If the author was polite and firm, maybe they aren't. But if they were rude, then yes. The original post says the author had to remind her a few times. It's possible that the author was respectful, but Kate still felt disrespected.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the bride has the final say on how their wedding is presented. So, the author's actions might be justified. However, if Kate felt humiliated, that's a problem. The answer might hinge on whether the author acted out of unkindness or just personal preference. Since the author's reason is about the wedding photos, not weight, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a cultural context or etiquette that says bridesmaid's pregnancy should be accommodated. Maybe not necessarily. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
