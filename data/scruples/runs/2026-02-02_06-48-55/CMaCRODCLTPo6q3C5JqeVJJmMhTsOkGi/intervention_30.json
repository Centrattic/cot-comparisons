Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was trying to show off her pregnant belly during the photos, and the author told her to stop. Now Kate is upset, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is the bride, and they paid for the wedding photos, which they wanted to focus on the wedding party, not maternity shots. On the other hand, Kate was just trying to highlight her pregnancy, which is a natural and happy event. The author had to ask her multiple times to stop, which might have come off as dismissive or insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the author was trying to maintain the intended focus of the photos. Weddings are about the couple and their entourage, not necessarily other life events. Maybe the author felt that Kate's actions were drawing attention away from the wedding. However, the way the author handled it could be an issue. Maybe they could have been more understanding or suggested a different pose that still allowed Kate to show her belly if that was important to her.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and hasn't contacted the author might indicate that her feelings were hurt. The author might not have considered how important it was for Kate to share her pregnancy moment during such a significant event. Maybe a compromise could have been made. But the author's main point is that they paid for wedding photos, not maternity ones, which is a valid point too.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were dismissive of Kate's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if they were trying to keep the photos focused, but they could have communicated more sensitively. However, if the author didn't consider Kate's desire to celebrate her pregnancy, that's where they might be at fault. So, there's a balance here. The answer could be either, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the author's actions were indeed inconsiderate or if they had a right to set boundaries on their own wedding photos.\n"
