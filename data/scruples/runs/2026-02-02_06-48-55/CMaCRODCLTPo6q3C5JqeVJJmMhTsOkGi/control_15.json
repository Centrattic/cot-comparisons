Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that she paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity photos. She wanted all the photos to focus on the wedding, not on the bridesmaid's pregnancy. She asked Kate to stop holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The key here is that the author's intention was about the wedding photos, which she had paid for, and she felt that emphasizing the belly was out of place.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy was a natural part of her body and that the author was being insensitive by not allowing her to showcase that. Pregnancy can be a sensitive topic, and some might see the author's actions as dismissive or critical of Kate's body.\n\nBut considering the context: the author was in the middle of her own wedding, which is a major event. She had specific plans for the photos. Kate's action of holding her belly could be seen as trying to draw attention to her pregnancy, which the author didn't want. The author had to remind her, which indicates that Kate wasn't following the agreed-upon posing. The author's response was to correct her, which is about maintaining the integrity of the wedding photos as intended.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is now avoiding the author and others have mentioned she's upset adds to the conflict. However, the author's primary responsibility was to her own event and the photos she paid for. While Kate's feelings are important, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries during her own wedding. It's a balance between respecting others' feelings and the main purpose of the event.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she was managing her event as she saw fit, within reasonable bounds.\n"
