Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was trying to show off her pregnant belly during the photos, and the bride told her to stop. The bride now feels Kate is upset and others have confirmed that Kate thinks the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The question is whether the bride is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The bride had a professional photoshoot and wanted it to focus on her wedding, not maternity photos. She asked Kate to stop holding her belly to make it obvious, which Kate found offensive. The bride's reasoning is that she paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots. Kate, on the other hand, might feel that her pregnancy was being minimized or that the bride was being insensitive.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the bride has the right to decide how she wants her wedding photos to look. It's her wedding, and she's spending her money. However, Kate's intention was to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a significant life event. The bride's request was to maintain a certain aesthetic, which is understandable. But the way it was handled could be perceived as dismissive. \n\nBut does that make the bride wrong? Maybe not. She's within her rights to set boundaries for her own event. However, there's a potential for a lack of empathy here. The bride didn't consider that Kate might see her actions as not acknowledging her pregnancy. The key is whether the bride's actions were disrespectful. \n\nThe bride asked Kate to stop holding her belly, which is a direct request but might not be the kindest approach. The bride could have approached it differently, perhaps by having a pre-photoshoot talk about the desired poses to avoid any awkwardness. Instead, she had to remind Kate multiple times, which could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate's choice to hold her belly in a way that's obvious might be her way of celebrating her pregnancy, but it's also possible she was overstepping the bride's expectations. The bride's wedding day is the focus, and the photos are supposed to highlight the wedding details, not other events.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the bride's actions were justified in wanting her photos to reflect her wedding, not maternity shots. However, the manner in which she handled it could be seen as lacking consideration. But in terms of being in the wrong, since it's her event and she's the one paying, she isn't necessarily in the wrong. Kate's feelings are valid, but the bride's perspective is also valid. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the bride has the right to control her event's presentation. However, there's a nuance here where the bride could have communicated better. But ultimately, the decision is hers to make regarding her own wedding photos.\n"
