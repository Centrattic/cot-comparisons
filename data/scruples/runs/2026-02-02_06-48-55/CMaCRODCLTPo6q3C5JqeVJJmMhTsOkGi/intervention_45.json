Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the wedding story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't let their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the photos. The author had to remind Kate several times to stop doing that and just pose normally. Now, Kate is upset and thinks the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to figure out if the author's actions were justified. The author paid for a wedding photoshoot, not a maternity shoot. They wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. But Kate was trying to show off her belly, which the author found inappropriate. The author's main concern seems to be about the purpose of the photos and ensuring that the wedding is the focus. \n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her life right now, and she wanted to include that in the photos. Maybe she felt proud and wanted to share her joy with the wedding. The author's repeated reminders could come across as dismissive or insensitive to Kate's feelings. \n\nBut the author also has a right to have the wedding photos reflect their vision. It's their day, and they might not want the photos to be about other people's milestones unless it's relevant. The question is whether the author overstepped by asking Kate to stop. \n\nI should consider social norms here. At a wedding, the primary focus is on the couple. Other attendees might want to be in the photos, but they usually comply with the couple's wishes. However, if someone feels their own experience is being disregarded, that's a valid concern. \n\nThe author had to remind Kate multiple times, which might indicate that Kate was persistent in her desire to show her belly. If the author had communicated their expectations beforehand, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But they didn't mention that. So maybe the author didn't set clear boundaries. \n\nAlso, Kate took offense and hasn't been in touch, which suggests she felt slighted. The author might not have considered how their actions affected Kate's feelings. However, the author's main point is about the purpose of the photos. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author had the right to request that the photos focus on the wedding, but perhaps their approach could have been more considerate. But overall, since it's the author's wedding and the photos are for their event, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nWait, but if Kate was just showing her belly naturally, maybe the author is overcorrecting. But she was deliberately holding it to make it more obvious. The author might have felt that was unnecessary. \n\nI think the key is that the author was within their rights to ask for the photos to focus on the wedding. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Also, considering that Kate was a bridesmaid, she should have followed the lead of the bride. So the author's request was reasonable.\n"
