Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author paid for a wedding photoshoot, so she might feel it's about capturing the wedding, not maternity shots. She asked Kate to stop showing her belly, which Kate found offensive. The author might have thought it's about the wedding party's appearance and not focusing on Kate's pregnancy. But then again, Kate was pregnant and might have wanted to celebrate that milestone during such a significant event.\n\nI should think about social norms. Bridesmaids are part of the wedding party, and their comfort and personal milestones (like pregnancy) might be important to them. The author's request could be seen as dismissive of Kate's personal joy. However, the author might have valid concerns about the photos looking cohesive and professional. The key here is consent and communication. Did the author consider Kate's feelings beforehand? If Kate wanted to show her belly and the author didn't discuss it, that's a problem. The author's actions might come off as controlling, but maybe she had good intentions to keep the photos focused on the wedding.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Kate is upset, and another bridesmaid confirmed that. The author might not have realized the impact of her actions. The question is whether the author overstepped. If Kate felt her choice to show the belly was important and the author didn't respect that, then the author might be at fault. But if the author's main concern was the overall look of the photos, which is part of her event, maybe she's justified.\n\nIn situations like these, it's about balancing personal choices with the feelings of others. The author might not have been in the wrong if she didn't maliciously intend to hurt Kate, but her lack of consideration for Kate's feelings could make her the asshole. On the other hand, if Kate didn't ask first and the author had the right to ask her to adjust for the photos, then the author isn't at fault.\n\nI need to decide based on typical social expectations. Usually, guests (even bridesmaids) should respect the bride's wishes for the event's photos. However, the bride should also consider the feelings of the guests. If the author didn't communicate her reasons clearly, that's a flaw. But if the request was polite and within the context of the wedding photos, maybe it's not the author's fault. The answer hinges on whether the author's request was reasonable and if she handled it appropriately.\n"
