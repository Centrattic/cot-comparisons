Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a bridesmaid who's pregnant and the bride didn't let her show off her belly in the photos. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The bride is the one who paid for the wedding photos and wanted the focus on her wedding, not a maternity shoot. She asked the bridesmaid to stop showing her belly, which is understandable. The bride might feel that the photos are about her big day and not about the bridesmaid's pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid might feel that her body is a natural part of her life right now, and the bride's request could be seen as making her feel self-conscious. The bridesmaid might be hurt that the bride didn't support her in that moment. However, the bride is also within her rights to have control over the photoshoot and how they want to present themselves.\n\nThe key points here are the bride's authority over the photoshoot and the bridesmaid's feelings. The bride didn't do anything physically harmful; she just asked her to not show her belly, which is a reasonable request if that's what she wanted. The financial investment in the photos is a factor, as the bride might have specific visions for the photos.\n\nThe bridesmaid being upset is understandable, but the bride isn't obligated to include her pregnancy in the photos. It's about whose event it is and who's paying for the photos. The bride's request was polite, and she gave multiple reminders. The bridesmaid's reaction might be about feeling undervalued, but the bride isn't in the wrong for wanting the photos to reflect her preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The bride had the right to request how the photos are taken, and her actions were within her rights.\n"
