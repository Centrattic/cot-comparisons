Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not letting their bridesmaid show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is the bride who paid for professional wedding photos. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The author noticed that Kate was holding her belly to show it off in the photos and asked her to stop. Now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nHmm. The bride paid for the photos and had the right to direct how the photos look. The wedding photos are about the bride and groom, not maternity shots. Kate's behavior seems like she was trying to draw attention to herself, which might not be appropriate. The author was within her rights to ask her to stop. However, the author could have been more considerate in her approach. Maybe she could have spoken to Kate privately or considered her feelings, but the main issue is that Kate was being self-centered during the wedding. The bride isn't obligated to accommodate Kate's desire for attention. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
