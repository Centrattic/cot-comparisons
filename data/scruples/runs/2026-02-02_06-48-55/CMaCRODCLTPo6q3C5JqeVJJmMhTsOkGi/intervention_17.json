Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. The author had to remind Kate multiple times to not hold her belly during the photos and now Kate is upset, feeling that the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: she paid for a wedding photo shoot, not a maternity shoot, and wanted consistent poses. She reminded Kate multiple times, which might have been perceived as being harsh. Kate's perspective: she's pregnant and wanted to show off her belly, which is a natural part of her body, and felt the author was trying to hide her pregnancy, possibly out of insecurity or not wanting the focus on Kate.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and understanding each other's feelings. The author had the right to set the tone for the photos as it's her wedding, but she also needs to consider Kate's feelings. However, if Kate was deliberately trying to show off her belly in a way that the author found distracting, the author has a right to ask her to stop. But the method of asking multiple times might have been abrupt, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the author might feel that the photos should focus on her wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and the author should accommodate that. The fact that Kate is now avoiding the author complicates things. The author might have overstepped if she didn't consider Kate's feelings, but she also has the right to her own preferences for the photos.\n\nIn similar situations, it's common for people to have differing opinions on how to handle such matters. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable if she had a clear vision, but the way she handled it could have been more sensitive. However, since it's the author's wedding and her photos, she's not wrong for setting that expectation. The bridesmaid's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected than the actual action. So, probably, the author isn't in the wrong because it's her wedding, but she could have been more empathetic in her approach. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
