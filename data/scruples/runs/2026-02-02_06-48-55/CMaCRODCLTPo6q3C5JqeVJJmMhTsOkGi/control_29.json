Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding where the author (the bride) didn't let her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the photos. The bride asked Kate to stop holding her belly to pose more naturally. Now Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant, and the bride is wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She paid a lot for the wedding photos, and she probably wanted the photos to look good for everyone involved. She mentions that Kate's dress was flowy, so the belly might have been visible anyway, but Kate was deliberately holding it to make it more obvious. The bride had to remind her a few times. It sounds like the bride was trying to maintain a consistent aesthetic for the photos, which is understandable. After all, the focus was on the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate's reaction might stem from feeling embarrassed or self-conscious about her body. Pregnancy can make people feel vulnerable, and if Kate felt that the bride was criticizing her appearance, that could lead to hurt feelings. The bride's friends mentioned that Kate is upset because she thinks the bride was trying to make her look fat. That suggests there might be a misunderstanding or a communication issue.\n\nBut was the bride wrong to ask Kate to stop holding her belly? Well, the bride had the right to set boundaries for the photos. She's the one paying for the shoot, so she can decide how the photos should look. It's not about making someone look fat; it's about maintaining the intended aesthetic. If Kate wanted to show her belly, maybe she should have chosen a pose that works with the flowy dress without holding it in a way that the bride found distracting.\n\nHowever, the way the bride approached it could be a factor. If she was rude or insensitive, that's different, but the story doesn't mention that. She just asked Kate to stop, and had to remind her a few times. That seems reasonable. The key is whether the bride's actions were about the photos or about Kate's body. Since the bride's reasoning is about the photos, not Kate's appearance, she might not be in the wrong here.\n\nAlso, considering that the dress was flowy, maybe the belly was already visible. So Kate's deliberate holding might have been unnecessary. The bride might have wanted the photos to look natural for all the wedding party members, not just highlight Kate's pregnancy. It's her day, after all.\n\nBut maybe Kate felt that her pregnancy was important to her, and the bride not allowing it made her feel excluded or unappreciated. That's a valid feeling, but does it make the bride the asshole? It's a bit of a social situation where both sides have valid points. However, the bride's main responsibility is to her own wedding, so she's not in the wrong if she's setting reasonable expectations for how the photos should be taken.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. She had the right to ask for a certain pose in the photos, especially since she's paying for them. The issue might be more about Kate's interpretation and sensitivity rather than the bride's actions being malicious.\n"
