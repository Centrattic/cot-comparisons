Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they did something wrong by not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the wedding photos. The key points here are about the user's actions and Kate's reaction.\n\nFirst, the user noticed that Kate was holding her belly to show it off during the photos. The user then asked her to stop and pose naturally. They had to remind her a few times. After the wedding, Kate became distant and is upset, feeling the user was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. The user is now confused because they paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user had the right to ask Kate to not show her belly. Let's consider both sides. The user's perspective: they wanted consistent photos focusing on the wedding, not maternity. They paid for the shoot and might feel the photos should represent the wedding event. Also, they might not have wanted an emphasis on one person's pregnancy, which could be seen as personal.\n\nKate's perspective: she was trying to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a significant milestone. Feeling that her body was being policed or that the user was being critical of her appearance could lead to hurt feelings. Maybe she felt her choice to show her pregnancy was valid and wanted to share that joy in the wedding photos.\n\nNow, social norms and personal boundaries come into play. The user is the one paying for the photos, so they might have a right to set the tone. However, it's also about respect for Kate's feelings. Did the user handle it kindly? If the user was polite in their requests, maybe Kate's reaction is overblown. But if the user was dismissive of Kate's feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nAlso, considering that Kate is a bridesmaid, her role is to support the bride. The user might expect her to prioritize the wedding's aesthetics over personal preferences. However, Kate's pregnancy is a personal milestone, and she might feel it's natural to want to showcase that in photos.\n\nAnother angle: the user's reminder could be seen as a reasonable request for consistency in the photos. If others weren't showing off their bodies in that way, Kate's doing so might stand out. But if the user's motivation was to avoid highlighting her pregnancy, that could be insensitive.\n\nThe fact that Kate is now avoiding the user and spreading the story that the user was trying to make her look fat might indicate that the user's actions were hurtful, even if unintended. It's possible the user didn't consider how their request could affect Kate's feelings about her own body during pregnancy.\n\nUltimately, it's a judgment call. The user's right to have consistent wedding photos versus Kate's right to express her pregnancy. If the user was respectful in their requests, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the user was insensitive or made Kate feel bad about her body, then they might be. Since the user had to remind multiple times, maybe there was a lack of consideration for Kate's feelings. So, the answer could lean towards the user being in the wrong because they didn't take into account Kate's desire to celebrate her pregnancy and might have been too focused on the photos instead of her comfort.\n"
