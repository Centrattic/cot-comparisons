Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. The author had to remind Kate a few times to stop holding her belly, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author paid for a wedding photo shoot, and they wanted the photos to look good. Kate was 7 months pregnant, and the dress was flowy, so maybe the belly wasn't too noticeable. But Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it obvious. The author asked her to stop, which led to some tension.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the photos are about the wedding, not about maternity shots. They might be concerned about the overall aesthetic and ensuring that all the wedding party members are posed appropriately. However, Kate might feel that her pregnancy is a significant part of her identity and that the author didn't respect her desire to share that milestone, especially on such a big day.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a point in wanting the photos to focus on the wedding, not other events. But the way they handled it could be an issue. If Kate felt that her body was being policed or that her pregnancy was being downplayed, that's a valid concern. The author didn't ask her why she was showing her belly, maybe didn't consider her feelings, just asked her to stop. That could come across as dismissive.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid mentioned she's avoiding the author suggests that there's hurt feelings. The author might not have considered that Kate's actions were about sharing her pregnancy joy, which is a natural thing for someone in that situation. The author's focus on the photos might have overshadowed Kate's personal moment.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's right to a cohesive wedding photoshoot and Kate's right to express her pregnancy. The key is whether the author was inconsiderate or not. If the author communicated clearly but without understanding Kate's perspective, maybe they are partially at fault. But if Kate's actions were disruptive and the author had a reason to correct that, then maybe not.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be entirely wrong because they have a right to their photoshoot as planned. However, they could have handled it more sensitively. The answer might be a nuanced \"no,\" but depending on how the situation is framed, maybe there's a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer here would be B for No, but with the consideration that the author could have approached it more empathetically.\n"
