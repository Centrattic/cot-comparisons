Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her bridesmaid, Kate, show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a wedding and hired a professional photographer. One of the bridesmaids, Kate, is pregnant. The author noticed that Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it more visible in the photos. The author asked her to stop and pose like everyone else. Then after the wedding, Kate seems to be upset, and another bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe author is now wondering if they're the asshole here. They paid for the photoshoot and wanted the focus on the wedding, not maternity shots. So the key points here are the author's intention versus Kate's feelings. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the photos were supposed to be about the wedding and not about individual features. They might also feel that the way Kate was posing was making her look bigger, which the author didn't want. But from Kate's side, she might feel that the author was being insensitive, especially since she's pregnant and might want to celebrate that aspect. \n\nI need to consider social norms around pregnancy and weddings. Pregnant people often want to showcase their pregnancy, especially if it's a significant life event. However, the wedding is the main event here. The author might not want the photos to focus on the pregnancy, which is understandable. But the way the author handled it could be seen as dismissive of Kate's feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is upset and the other bridesmaid confirmed that, suggests that the author's actions might have hurt her feelings. Even if the author's intention was just to have the photos look like a proper wedding party, the way they told Kate to stop might have been rude or inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: was the author polite in their requests? The user mentioned they had to remind her a few times. If the author was firm but respectful, maybe it's different. But if they were dismissive or rude, that's a problem. The description says \"I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else.\" The phrasing \"show off\" might imply that the author thought Kate was being self-centered, but Kate might have been trying to celebrate her pregnancy. \n\nIn terms of social media dynamics, the user is on Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, where the community often looks for whether the person's actions were considerate of others' feelings. The question is whether the author was being inconsiderate by not allowing Kate to celebrate her pregnancy in the photos. \n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the author was inconsiderate. The author had the right to request that the photos focus on the wedding, but the way they did it might have been hurtful. It's possible that the author could have had a more empathetic approach, perhaps discussing it with Kate beforehand or understanding her desire to showcase her pregnancy. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were paying for the photos and wanted them to reflect the wedding, but they could have handled it better. However, the community might see it the other way if they prioritize Kate's feelings. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions were reasonable but Kate was being self-centered, then the author isn't the asshole. But if the author was rude or dismissive without considering Kate's feelings, then maybe they are. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the author was within their rights to request the poses since they were paying for the photos. However, perhaps they could have been more understanding and found a compromise. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they were managing the event as the main focus, but there's a nuance. However, given the way Kate felt, maybe the answer is A? Hmm. Wait, but the author's reasoning is that they wanted the photos to be wedding-focused, not maternity. That's a valid point. So the answer is B.\n"
