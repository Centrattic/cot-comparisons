Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not allowing their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly during wedding photos. The author had to ask Kate multiple times to not hold her belly, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author is trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author wanted the wedding photos to look cohesive and professional. Kate's dress was flowy, so a pregnant belly wouldn't be too intrusive. However, Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it obvious, which the author didn't want. The author had to remind her multiple times, and now there's a rift because Kate feels hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author is paying for the photos and has a right to how they look. On the other hand, Kate's actions were to celebrate her pregnancy, which is a natural part of her life. The author's request was about maintaining the wedding photos' aesthetic, but maybe they should have considered Kate's feelings more.\n\nBut then, the author did pay for the photos, so they have some control over how the photos are taken. However, the way they handled it might have been inconsiderate. Maybe they could have talked to Kate privately before the photos, explaining their concerns instead of public reminders. That might have been more respectful.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate is pregnant and wants to show off her belly is understandable. The author's insistence on not having the belly shown could be seen as trying to downplay Kate's pregnancy, which is a sensitive issue. However, the author isn't necessarily being mean; they just want the photos to look like wedding photos, not a maternity shoot.\n\nBut there's a balance between respecting the author's wishes and Kate's comfort. If the author had communicated their preferences in advance, maybe Kate could have adjusted her posing without the need for repeated reminders. The author's approach might have come off as dismissive or insensitive, leading to Kate feeling upset.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" test, it's about whether the author's actions were justified. The author's main concern is the photos, which is valid. But how they handled it\u2014repeatedly asking in the moment and not considering Kate's feelings\u2014might make them the asshole. Alternatively, if Kate was being disruptive by trying to draw attention to her pregnancy, the author had a right to correct that.\n\nI think the key here is the method of communication. The author could have been more considerate in their approach. Instead of snapping at Kate during the photoshoot, maybe a private conversation beforehand about the style of the photos. But given that the author did pay for the shoot, they have a right to their vision. However, not considering that Kate's actions were also a way to share her joy might be where the author went wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author's main issue was the aesthetics, they might not be the asshole, but their handling of the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they were being overly controlling without understanding Kate's perspective, then they might be. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might side with the author. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and personal expectations.\n"
