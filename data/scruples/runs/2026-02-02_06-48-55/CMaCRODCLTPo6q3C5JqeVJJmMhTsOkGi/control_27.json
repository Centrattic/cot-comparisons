Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where a bridesmaid, Kate, was 7 months pregnant and was showing off her belly during the photos. The author, the bride, asked her to stop, which led to Kate being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the bride's perspective. She paid for a wedding photo shoot, not a maternity shoot. It's understandable that she wants the focus to be on the wedding and not on individual features, even if someone is pregnant. The bride asked Kate to stop holding her belly in the photos, which is within her right as the main subject of the wedding. She's likely trying to maintain a cohesive look for the photos and avoid any unintended emphasis on other aspects.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate was trying to show off her pregnancy, which is a natural desire for some people. However, in a group setting like a wedding, individual desires might need to be balanced with the collective experience. The bride's request was polite but firm, and she had to remind Kate multiple times. The fact that Kate is now upset and the other bridesmaid confirmed her anger adds context. It's possible that Kate felt her body or her pregnancy wasn't acknowledged or respected.\n\nBut the key points here are ownership of the event and the setting. The wedding is the bride's event, and she has the authority to make decisions about how the photos are taken. The photographer's role is to capture the wedding, not necessarily to accommodate every individual's preference. The bride's action was about maintaining the integrity of the event's photography, which she paid for. \n\nAlso, considering that Kate is a bridesmaid, her role is to support the bride in the main event. While showing off her belly might be important to her, the bride's request was reasonable. The bride isn't trying to shame her for being pregnant, just asking her to fit into the planned photo setup. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If Kate felt that her body was being policed, that's a valid concern. But in this case, the bride's intention wasn't to make her look fat, but to keep the focus on the wedding. The fact that Kate avoided the author after the wedding and is now upset suggests that there might be underlying issues, but the initial action of asking her to adjust her pose doesn't seem malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the bride's actions were within her rights to maintain the wedding's photography as she envisioned it. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
