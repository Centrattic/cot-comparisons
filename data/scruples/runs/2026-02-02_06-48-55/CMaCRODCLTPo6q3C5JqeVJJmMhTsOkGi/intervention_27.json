Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a bridesmaid who was showing off her pregnant belly during wedding photos, and the bride had to ask her to stop. Now the bridesmaid is upset and thinks the bride was trying to make her look fat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The bride paid for a wedding photo shoot, which she presumably wants to focus on her own wedding, not on maternity photos. She asked the bridesmaid to stop holding her belly to show it off, which seems reasonable to her. But the bridesmaid is upset, feeling that the bride is trying to hide her pregnancy.\n\nThe bride's main concern is about the photos being about her wedding day, not the bridesmaid's pregnancy. She might feel that the photos should represent the whole wedding party equally. However, the bridesmaid might feel that her pregnancy was a significant part of her identity at the time and wanted to be acknowledged.\n\nIs the bride in the wrong? Well, she asked the bridesmaid to stop adjusting her pose. She didn't force her; she just asked. The bridesmaid chose to show off her belly, which the bride didn't want in the photos. The bride's request was about maintaining the focus on the wedding. On the other hand, the bridesmaid's reaction might be about feeling disrespected or not validated in her pregnancy.\n\nBut from the bride's point of view, she's within her rights to request how the photos are taken since she's the one paying and the event is about her marriage. The key is whether she overstepped. If the bride made the bridesmaid feel bad about her body, that's different. But the bride's intention was to have standard wedding photos, and she asked politely. The bridesmaid's response might be overreacting. \n\nSo, the bride is not in the wrong. She's managing her event and the photos as she sees fit. The bridesmaid might be taking it personally, but the bride's actions were reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
