Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a bride who didn't allow her pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her belly in wedding photos.\n\nFirst, the bride had a specific vision for the photos, as she paid for a professional shoot. She noticed Kate was holding her belly to make it obvious, and asked her to stop. The bride had to remind her a few times. Now, Kate is upset, thinking the bride was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal choice and boundaries. The bride has the right to decide how the photos look since she's the one who hired the photographer and paid for the shoot. The dress was already accommodating, so the bride's request for Kate to pose like everyone else seems reasonable. Kate's actions might be seen as trying to draw attention to her pregnancy, which the bride didn't want. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that Kate felt her pregnancy was a natural part of her body and wanted to celebrate that. But the bride's main concern was about the photos being wedding-focused. The fact that Kate is now upset and avoiding the bride suggests there's some hurt feelings, but the bride's actions were based on her own preferences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the bride wasn't being malicious. She was maintaining her vision for the photos. Kate's reaction could be due to feeling embarrassed or not wanting to be criticized, but the bride's request was within her rights. The answer seems to be that the bride isn't in the wrong because she's entitled to her preference for the photos.\n"
