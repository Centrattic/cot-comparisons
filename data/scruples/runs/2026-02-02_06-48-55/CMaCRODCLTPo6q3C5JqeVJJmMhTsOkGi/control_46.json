Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author didn't let their pregnant bridesmaid, Kate, show off her belly in the wedding photos. The author had to ask Kate multiple times to stop holding her belly in a way that made it obvious, and now Kate is upset, thinking the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They paid a lot for the wedding photos and wanted the photos to be about the wedding, not maternity shots. It's their wedding day, and they might not want the focus to be on someone else's pregnancy. The author likely wanted the photos to look natural and not have elements that could distract from the main event. Also, the author had to ask Kate multiple times, which suggests that Kate was being intentional about showing her belly, maybe more than what was appropriate or expected during a wedding photo session. The author's request for Kate to pose like everyone else seems reasonable if the goal is to maintain a cohesive look in the photos.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate's perspective is that she's pregnant and wanted to celebrate that aspect of her life during the wedding. Maybe she felt that her pregnancy was a significant part of her identity at that time and wanted to include it in the photos. If the author's insistence made her feel embarrassed or excluded, that's a valid concern. However, the wedding is primarily the author's event, so their preferences should take precedence unless there was prior agreement about including maternity elements.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to prioritize their wedding photos and the expectation that the wedding party should blend in. Kate's actions might have been seen as self-centered if she was deliberately trying to draw attention to her pregnancy during the photos. The author's request to pose normally isn't unreasonable, especially if the dress was already accommodating her belly without needing to be held. The fact that the author had to remind her multiple times suggests that Kate was aware but chose to ignore the request, which adds to the author's justification.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to set the tone for the wedding photos, and their actions were to ensure the photos met the desired aesthetic for their big day. Kate's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's stance is understandable given the context.\n"
