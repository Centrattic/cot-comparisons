Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their pregnant bridesmaid show off her belly in the wedding photos. The main points here are about the wedding photoshoot and the bridesmaid's actions.\n\nFirst, the author had a professional photoshoot for the wedding party. The bridesmaid, Kate, was holding her belly to make it obvious in the photos. The author asked her to stop multiple times. Then after the wedding, Kate seems upset, and another bridesmaid says she's mad because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant.\n\nThe author is confused because they paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots. So the question is whether the author was wrong to ask Kate to stop.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's perspective is that they wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy. It's their wedding, so they might have the right to decide the photo composition. But on the other hand, Kate's pregnancy is a part of her body, and she might have wanted to celebrate that. However, the author explicitly asked her to stop, which could be seen as dismissive of her pregnancy, especially if Kate felt it was important to her. \n\nBut wait, the author had to remind her multiple times. That suggests that Kate wasn't respecting the photo shoot's purpose. The author paid for the photos to capture the wedding, not a maternity shoot. So maybe the author is justified in wanting the photos to align with the wedding theme. However, if Kate felt her choice to show her belly was important, the author's insistence might have been insensitive. \n\nBut the key here is that the author was the one paying for the photos and organizing the event. The wedding is the author's event, so they have the right to make such decisions. Kate might be upset because she felt her personal milestone wasn't acknowledged, but the author's priority is the wedding. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because it's their event and they have the final say on how the photos look. However, maybe there's a middle ground where they could have communicated better or found a balance. But based on the information given, the author asked Kate to stop, which is their right as the wedding planner. So the answer is B (No).\n"
