Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her bridesmaid, Kate, to show off her pregnant belly in the wedding photos.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is the one who asked Kate to stop holding her belly to show it off. The author's main concern is that they paid for wedding photos, not maternity ones. So they wanted the focus to be on the wedding, not on Kate's pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, Kate might feel that she wanted to share her pregnancy and that the author was dismissive of her situation. The other bridesmaid confirmed that Kate is upset because the author was trying to make her look fat, not pregnant. That suggests Kate felt her body was being judged or that her pregnancy wasn't being acknowledged.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to have control over the wedding photos and Kate's right to express her pregnancy. The author's dress was flowy, so maybe there was a way to include the belly without making it the focus. However, if Kate was deliberately trying to show her belly, the author might have a valid point about the photos being for the wedding, not maternity.\n\nBut then again, asking someone not to hold their belly could be seen as making them hide their body, which might be insensitive. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing with Kate beforehand or choosing a different pose that includes both the wedding and her pregnancy.\n\nThe fact that the author had to remind Kate multiple times could imply that Kate was trying to show it off, which the author didn't want. However, if Kate felt her body was being criticized, that's a valid hurt feeling. The author's main argument is about the photo shoot's purpose, but maybe there's a balance between the wedding focus and acknowledging Kate's pregnancy.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention wasn't to be mean, just to keep the photos as wedding ones. However, not considering Kate's feelings about her pregnancy might be the issue. The answer depends on whether the author's request was reasonable and respectful. If the author's main concern was the photos, but didn't consider Kate's feelings, that could be where the author's wrong. But if the author handled it politely and with a clear purpose, maybe not.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to decide how their wedding photos look. However, maybe they could have been more understanding. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the main factor is intent. The author's intent was to have wedding photos, not to humiliate Kate. So the answer is B.\n"
