I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a bride who had a wedding. One of her bridesmaids, Kate, is 7 months pregnant. The dress Kate wore had a flowy skirt and a fitted bust. During the wedding photos, Kate was holding her belly to show it off, similar to maternity photo styles. The author told her to stop doing that and to pose like everyone else. She had to remind her a few times. After the wedding, Kate didn't respond to texts and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the author was trying to make her look fat instead of pregnant. Now the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was in the wrong by not allowing Kate to show off her pregnancy in the photos. Let's consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She paid for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity photos. She wanted professional photos focused on the wedding party. She might have felt that having someone hold their belly to accentuate it wasn't appropriate for a wedding setting. She also had to remind Kate multiple times, which suggests that Kate was intentional about showing her belly.\n\nFrom Kate's perspective: She's pregnant and might have felt excited to share her pregnancy. It's a natural part of her body, and she might have wanted to highlight it as a milestone. Feeling that the author was trying to hide her pregnancy could lead to hurt feelings. The other bridesmaid's comment implies that Kate took offense, possibly feeling embarrassed or that her body was being policed.\n\nCultural and social norms: Pregnant women often want to show off their bellies when they're comfortable with it. However, in a formal event like a wedding, the photos are meant to focus on the couple and the wedding party's appearance. The author might have a right to set boundaries for the photoshoot, especially since she's paying for it. But there's also a consideration of sensitivity towards a friend's feelings.\n\nPossible factors: Was there prior discussion about the photos? If the author didn't mention that they had a specific vision, maybe she should have communicated better. On the other hand, if Kate was being overly obvious about it, the author might have a right to ask her to adjust. The fact that Kate was holding her belly in a way that made it obvious (like in maternity photos) might not align with the wedding photos' aesthetic, which are usually more about the event rather than individual milestones.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Kate didn't talk to the author and the other bridesmaid relayed that Kate was upset. The author might need to consider if her actions were polite and understanding. Maybe she could have approached it differently, like explaining her reasoning instead of just telling Kate to stop. However, the author's stance is that she's paying for the photos and wants them to reflect the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the author's intent was to have professional wedding photos, she's not wrong to ask Kate to pose appropriately. However, if she dismissed Kate's feelings without understanding, she might be seen as insensitive. But given the information, the author had a right to set the tone for the photoshoot. It's possible that Kate's reaction was more about personal feelings than the author's intent. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe she could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not if she handled it perfectly. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She had the right to direct the photoshoot as she saw fit, especially since she's paying for it. The issue might be more about Kate's reaction than the author's actions.\n"
