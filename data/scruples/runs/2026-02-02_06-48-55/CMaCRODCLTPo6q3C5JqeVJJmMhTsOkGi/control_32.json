Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding photo shoot where the author, the bride, asked a pregnant bridesmaid (Kate) not to show off her belly in the photos. The key points are:\n\n1. Kate was 7 months pregnant and wearing a flowy dress that could accommodate a belly.\n2. The bride noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly to show it off in the photos. The bride asked her to stop, and had to remind her multiple times.\n3. After the wedding, Kate didn't contact the bride, and another bridesmaid said Kate was upset because the bride was \"trying to make her look fat, not pregnant.\"\n4. The bride is now wondering if she was wrong, considering she paid for the photos and wanted them to look a certain way, not like a maternity shoot.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the bride was in the wrong for asking Kate not to show her belly in the wedding photos. Let's consider the possible arguments.\n\nOn the bride's side: She paid for the photos, wanted them to look specific, and the photos were part of the wedding party. The dress was designed to fit, so the belly wouldn't be hidden. The bride asked politely, multiple times, which could be seen as reasonable since the photos were for the wedding, not maternity shots.\n\nOn Kate's side: She was pregnant, and showing her belly might be part of her personal pride and joy. Feeling that the bride was making her look fat could be hurtful. However, the bride's request was to pose naturally, not to hide her pregnancy. The fact that the dress could accommodate the belly suggests that the bride wasn't trying to hide it, just didn't want it to be the focus.\n\nPossible cultural or social norms: Weddings are about the couple, so the photos should focus on them. However, bridesmaids are part of the event, and their personal circumstances might be considered. But the bride has the right to direct how the photos look.\n\nAnother angle: The bride's communication style. She had to remind Kate multiple times, which could imply that Kate felt she wasn't being respected. However, the bride's intent was to maintain the photo composition, not to be rude.\n\nAlso, the fact that Kate didn't reach out after the wedding and then another bridesmaid mentioned she was upset could indicate that the bride's actions did cause hurt feelings. But the bride might not be in the wrong if her intention was to keep the photos focused on the wedding, not on individual features.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the bride overstepped by asking Kate not to show her belly, given that the dress allowed for it. Since the bride's photos were for the wedding and she directed the poses, it's more about her right to manage the photo shoot. However, the way she handled it (multiple reminders) might have come off as dismissive. But the main issue is intent: the bride wanted the photos for the wedding, not maternity shots. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
