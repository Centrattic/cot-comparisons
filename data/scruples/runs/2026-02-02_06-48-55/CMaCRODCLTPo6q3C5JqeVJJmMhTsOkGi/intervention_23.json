Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting a pregnant bridesmaid show her belly in the wedding photos. \n\nFirst, the author is the bride. She noticed that one of her bridesmaids, Kate, was holding her belly to show it off in the photos. The bride asked her to stop, and Kate was upset about it. The bride is now wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The bride paid for wedding photos, not maternity shots. She wanted the photos to focus on the wedding, not the pregnancy. On the other hand, Kate was pregnant and might feel that her body's changes are a natural part of her identity and she wanted to be comfortable, or maybe even share the joy of her pregnancy during the wedding.\n\nBut the bride's perspective is that she's in charge of the event. She's the one who hired the photographer and paid for the shoot. It's her wedding day, so she might have a right to decide the aesthetic. However, was it considerate to not let Kate have some autonomy in how she wanted to present herself, especially if the belly wasn't making her look fat but just showing her pregnancy?\n\nBut wait, the bride's main point is that she didn't want maternity photos. Maybe Kate was doing it to show off, but the bride felt that the focus should be on the wedding. However, the bride's friends might side with Kate, thinking the bride was dismissive of her pregnancy. But is the bride wrong for setting boundaries on her own event?\n\nAlso, considering that the dress was flowy and the belly was already visible, maybe the bride's intervention was unnecessary. But if Kate was deliberately holding her belly to make it more prominent, the bride might have a valid reason to ask her to stop, to keep the photos consistent with the other bridesmaids.\n\nBut is it the bride's right to control how a guest poses in photos? Or is Kate within her rights to pose comfortably, especially during pregnancy? This is a balance between the bride's control over her wedding and the bridesmaid's comfort.\n\nI think the key is that the bride is the one paying and the event is hers. She has the authority to set the tone and style. However, the way she handled it might have been harsh. If Kate was trying to be comfortable or wanted to share her pregnancy joy, the bride's repeated reminders could come off as dismissive. But the bride's reasoning is that she didn't want maternity photos. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, allowing Kate to pose naturally without trying to emphasize the belly. But the bride's action was to stop Kate from showing it off, which could be seen as rude if Kate felt it was her choice. However, in a wedding context, the bride's preferences often take precedence. \n\nSo, is the bride in the wrong? If the bride is the one paying and the photos are hers, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if Kate's actions were within reason and the bride was being controlling, maybe she is. The flowy dress already showed the belly, so maybe Kate was just trying to look comfortable. The bride's insistence could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nBut ultimately, the bride's event, so she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
