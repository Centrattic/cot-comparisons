Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They want to know if they are at fault (\"AITA?\"). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is into history and guns, and they have a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the historical context of the rifle possibly being used against Nazis. The sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. \n\nA friend at the range found it insensitive or offensive. The person argues that the phrase comes from WWII and the rifle's history, not modern politics. Their friends agreed with them, but they're doubting themselves.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: intention vs. perception. The user's intention was historical, referencing the original context of the phrase. However, the friend interpreted it differently, seeing it as implying the user would use the gun against others now. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, intent matters, but so does how others perceive it. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed a historical reference, originally from WWII. The user's explanation makes sense, and they didn't mean to imply modern usage. However, in today's climate, even historical references can be seen as having modern political connotations. The friend's concern is about the potential for the sticker to be misread as supporting violence against a political group today, even if that's not the intent. \n\nBut the user is clear that they're not referring to modern politics. They also mention that the sticker is easily removable and that they have another unmodified gun. The main issue here is whether the sticker's message could be offensive regardless of intent. The user didn't intend to offend, but the friend felt it was insensitive. \n\nIn such cases, it's possible that the user isn't in the wrong because they had a historical, educational intent. However, the fact that someone found it offensive might mean that they should consider others' perspectives. The sticker could be seen as trivializing the historical context or being used in a way that could be misinterpreted. But since the user didn't intend that and explained their reasoning, and their friends supported them, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action was not meant to offend and the user made an effort to explain the historical context, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the sticker's presence, regardless of intent, causes someone else to feel offended, there's a case to say they should have considered that. \n\nBut in many AITA scenarios, intent is a big factor. Since the user's intent was historical and educational, and they didn't have malicious intent, they might not be in the wrong. The friend's reaction is valid, but the user isn't necessarily at fault for expressing their historical interest.\n"
