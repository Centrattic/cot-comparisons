Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the rifle was used in WWII and the sticker is a nod to its historical context. They mention that the quote \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was from WWII, associated with Pete Seeger, and not a modern invention. The person also clarifies that they don't use the rifle for anything offensive and it's part of their historical hobby.\n\nThe person being criticized said the sticker is insensitive because it might imply the user would use the gun to kill people now, especially if compared to other ideologies or groups. The user's friends supported them, but they're still unsure. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent vs. perception. The user's intent is historical appreciation and honoring WWII context. The sticker's original meaning is tied to a specific historical period. However, someone else might interpret it differently in today's context, especially with current political tensions. The user is using an antique gun for recreational shooting, not for any violent purpose now. The sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified version.\n\nThe debate is whether the phrase, even if historically accurate, is offensive now because it could imply support for using violence against modern groups labeled as \"fascists.\" The user's friends agree with them, but the critic argues it's similar to other offensive uses. \n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The user's explanation for the sticker is well-meaning and rooted in history. The phrase itself is from a specific era and was used in a different context. However, the problem arises if others perceive it as a call to violence in the present. Since the user didn't intend that and the context is historical, but others might misinterpret it, it's a gray area. \n\nThe user isn't engaging in hate speech or promoting violence, but they might be unaware of the sticker's potential modern connotations. The answer would depend on whether intent is considered, or if the potential for misinterpretation makes it offensive. Since the user is in a hobbyist context and not using the phrase in a current political sense, they might not be at fault. The critic's comparison to other ideologies is flawed because the original phrase is tied to a specific historical event. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
