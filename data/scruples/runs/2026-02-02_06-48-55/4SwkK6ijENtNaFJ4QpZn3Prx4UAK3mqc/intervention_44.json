Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their gun. The author explains that the gun is a historical Mosin Nagant from WWII, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing the original quote from WWII, which was associated with the same era as the gun. They argue that the sticker refers to the historical context, not modern politics, and it's easily removable.\n\nThe other person found it offensive, suggesting it implies the author might use the gun to kill people now, comparing it to using the phrase for other ideologies. The author's friends supported them, but they're questioning if they're wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a 1940s slogan promoting firearms for fighting Nazis. The author is using it on a historical gun, which they own and use for shooting targets. The sticker is removable and not permanent. The main issue is whether using this historical reference on a modern gun in a shooting range is offensive or insensitive today.\n\nThe other person's concern is that the phrase could be interpreted as promoting violence against a specific group, even if the author's intent is historical. However, the phrase's original context is tied to WWII, so the author's usage might be seen as referencing that history rather than modern politics. The author also clarifies they don't link it to current issues. \n\nBut does the context matter? If someone without knowledge of the historical reference sees the sticker, they might misinterpret it as advocating violence. The author might be in the wrong if their action could cause offense, even unintentionally. However, if the majority of people in their circle understand the historical context and the author's intent is respectful, maybe not. Also, the fact that the gun is used for target practice and not violence might mitigate the issue.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. impact. The author intended to reference history, but the impact on others might be negative. The decision depends on whether the context is clear to others. If the sticker could reasonably be seen as insensitive regardless of intent, then the author is in the wrong. However, if the historical reference is well-known and the usage is non-offensive (like a museum piece), they might not be. Since the gun is used for target practice, not violence, but the phrase could still be misinterpreted, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's friends supported them, but that doesn't mean they aren't wrong. The answer hinges on whether the usage is respectful versus potentially offensive.\n"
