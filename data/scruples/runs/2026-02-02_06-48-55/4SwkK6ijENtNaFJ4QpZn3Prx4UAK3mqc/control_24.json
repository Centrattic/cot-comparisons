Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves some nuances around historical context, intent, and others' perceptions.\n\nFirst, the author's intent is key. They mention that the sticker is a joke referencing the rifle's WWII history and the original quote from the 40s. The phrase was a real thing from that era, associated with labor movements and anti-fascism. The author isn't using it in a modern political context but rather acknowledging the rifle's possible historical role. They also note that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun, so there's no harm to the artifact's integrity.\n\nThen there's the person who found it offensive. They argue that the sticker implies the gun could be used to kill people today, comparing it to more controversial stickers. The author counters that the phrase is historical and not meant for modern ideologies. The friends agree with the author, so it's a disagreement in interpretation.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the intent was purely historical and not to offend, and they didn't intend to make a modern political statement, then maybe not. However, the sticker could be misinterpreted. But the original phrase isn't inherently offensive; it's a historical reference. The author isn't promoting violence against any group today. The person who criticized it made a comparison that might not be fair, since the original context is different. The author's clarification about the historical aspect seems valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The intent was respectful to history, and while others may take offense, the author didn't intend to be insensitive. Context matters here, and the author's explanation supports their position.\n"
