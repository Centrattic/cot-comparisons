Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a WWII-era gun. They argue that the phrase was from WWII, like the quote by Guthrie, and that the rifle's history is connected to that era. The friend found it insensitive or offensive, suggesting it might imply using the gun to kill people today, similar to other ideologies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the phrase. \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a classic example from mid-20th century, often associated with the labor movement and WWII. The original intent was to highlight the destructive power of the machine (like a combine harvester) against the enemy (fascists). But the author is applying it to a real gun that was used in that war. The friend's concern is that using the phrase now might be seen as trivializing it or suggesting a modern use, even if the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nThe author's defense is that the sticker is a historical reference, not a modern political statement. They mention that the gun is historical and the phrase is from the same time period. They also note the sticker can be removed and they have another unmodified gun. However, the key point here is whether the sticker is appropriate in today's context. Even if the phrase is old, putting it on a gun could be misinterpreted. People might not know the historical background and could take it as a threat or as supporting a modern extremist agenda.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person made a comparison to using the same phrasing for other groups is important. If the phrase is specific to WWII and Nazis, then the author's intent is to connect to that history. But if someone else could twist it into a modern context, the author might not be in control of how others interpret it. The question is about insensitivity, which often hinges on how the action is perceived by others, not just the intent.\n\nThe author's friends sided with them, so maybe there's a generational or cultural divide here. The author might not see the issue, but others do. Guns are already a sensitive topic, and combining them with a phrase that has a clear historical war context could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's in a public setting like a shooting range where people from different backgrounds might be present. The sticker could be seen as mocking the original intent of the phrase, which was to encourage solidarity against fascism, by placing it on a weapon. \n\nBut the author also points out that the gun is part of their historical collection and that the phrase is from the same era. They might be trying to honor the history rather than use it as a political statement. However, the phrase \"kills fascists\" is inherently controversial when placed on a lethal weapon, regardless of the actual target. It's a matter of perception. Even if the author's intent is historical, the sticker's message is still about using the gun to kill a specific group, which can be offensive. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh both intent and impact. If the impact is that someone found it offensive and the author didn't take their concerns seriously enough, maybe they are in the wrong. But the author did explain their reasoning and the sticker is removable. The main issue is whether the phrase is inconsiderate or offensive in a context where it might be misunderstood. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong if they intended it as a historical reference and made that clear. But the fact that the sticker is on a gun, which is a weapon, and the phrase's potential for misinterpretation in the present could mean they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the community values the historical context or the potential for causing offense more. Since the question is about being insensitive, the impact on others is crucial. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not anticipating how others might perceive the sticker.\n"
