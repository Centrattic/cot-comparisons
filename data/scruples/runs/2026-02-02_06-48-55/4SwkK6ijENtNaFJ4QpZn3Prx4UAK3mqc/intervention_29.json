Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the rifle is historical and the sticker references its possible WWII use. The person who confronted them thinks it's offensive because it could imply modern intentions to kill, similar to how such phrases are used today.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was actually a WWII-era slogan by Pete Seeger for a promotional campaign. The user is using it in reference to the rifle's historical context. They also mention that the rifle is from WWII and possibly used in that period. The user isn't using the sticker in a modern political way but to reference its historical past.\n\nHowever, the confrontation happened because someone perceived it as offensive. The user's defense is that the phrase is historical and the rifle is for shooting paper targets, not people. The friends supported them, but the user is still unsure. The key here is intent vs. perception. The user's intent was historical homage, but others might interpret it as promoting violence or modern political statements.\n\nIn similar situations, intent doesn't always override perception. For example, if a person wears a Nazi uniform as a historical reenactment, it's contextually different from doing so to promote hate. But if the audience doesn't get the context, it can still be offensive. In this case, the sticker's original context is historical, but in today's climate, \"fascists\" is a term heavily used in modern political discourse. So even if the user's intention is historical, the sticker could be misread by others.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the rifle is used for shooting targets, not people. But the presence of a weapon with such a sticker might be unsettling regardless. The person who confronted them argues that using such a phrase on a weapon could imply using it to kill people, which is a valid concern. The user counters by saying it's a historical reference, but the comparison to modern ideologies is made by others.\n\nThe user is in the position of having a hobby that involves historical firearms. They have a genuine interest in the history, but they're also adding a modern (albeit historical) slogan to a weapon. The problem arises when others interpret it differently. Even if the user's intention is not to offend, the sticker's placement on a functional weapon might lead to misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user should consider how their action affects others. While they may not have intended to promote violence, the sticker's association with a weapon could be seen as endorsing the use of violence against a group, even if that group is historically defined. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of historical context, but the perception and potential impact on others could make them responsible for the insensitivity.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing intent with perception. If the user's primary intent is historical and they've communicated that clearly, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the sticker's presence on a weapon leads others to perceive it as endorsing violence, then there's a case for them being in the wrong. Since the user acknowledges the possibility of insensitivity and is reflecting on it, there's a degree of self-awareness. However, the fact that someone found it offensive and the user's own doubt suggest that there's a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention is historical, the sticker's placement on a weapon might be seen as insensitive due to the modern connotations and the potential misinterpretation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how others could perceive it.\n"
