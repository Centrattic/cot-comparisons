Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They got some pushback from a friend, and now they're doubting themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era rifle from Russia. The sticker references a historical quote from Woody Guthrie used during WWII against Nazis. The person uses the gun for shooting at a range, not for anything violent now. The sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe friend argues that the sticker implies the user would use the gun to kill people today, comparing it to using other ideologies in the same way. The user counters that the phrase is historical, like the gun itself, and wasn't meant to be offensive. Their friends support them, but they're still uncertain.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether using the sticker is insensitive or offensive. The key points are intent, historical context, and perception. The user's intent was to reference WWII history, and the gun isn't used for violence now. However, the sticker's phrase, even if historical, might be misinterpreted in a modern context, especially with current political tensions around terms like \"fascists.\"\n\nThe user's argument is that the phrase is tied to WWII, but others might not see the historical reference and think it's targeting modern ideologies. The user's defense is that the phrase is from the same time as the gun, but others could see it as equating their historical use with modern intentions.\n\nConsidering free speech, the user has the right to express themselves, but the offensiveness depends on context. The sticker is on a gun, which inherently can be seen as a weapon, so the phrase might be seen as justifying violence. But the user clarifies that the gun is used for target practice, not people. Still, the combination of a weapon and a phrase implying killing could be seen as problematic, even if historically accurate.\n\nThe user's friends support them, but the critic's concern is valid in that the phrase could be misread. The user might not be in the wrong if their intent is purely historical and non-offensive, but they should be aware that others might perceive it differently. However, since the phrase is from the same era and the context is historical, the user's position has merit. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because intent and historical context are key, but there's a nuance where perception matters.\n"
