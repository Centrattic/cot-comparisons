Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the historical significance of the gun, and the social reaction they received.\n\nFirst, the sticker itself is a reference to a WWII-era slogan. The original phrase was used by Woody Guthrie, and it's tied to the historical context of fighting fascism during the war. The user has a Mosin Nagant, a rifle known from that period, so the connection to WWII is there. They mention that the gun was made during WWII in Tula, which might have been used in the war. The user clarifies they use the gun at shooting ranges, shooting at paper targets, not people. They also have another unmodified version of the same gun, so this isn't altering a historical artifact beyond a removable sticker.\n\nThe friend who called it insensitive argues that the sticker could imply the user wants to kill people, comparing it to putting similar phrases for other ideologies. The user counters that the phrase is historical and not meant for modern politics. The friends sided with the user, but the user is unsure.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether using a historical slogan on a historical weapon in a non-threatening context is offensive or insensitive. The user isn't using the gun to threaten people; they're shooting at targets and the sticker is a nod to history. The original phrase was about fighting fascism in the past. However, in modern times, the phrase can be co-opted in political discussions, which might cause confusion or offense for some people. But the user's intent is historical appreciation, not political statement. Since the sticker is removable and the context is about historical use, the user isn't in the wrong. The friend's comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, as the original phrase has a specific historical context. Therefore, the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
