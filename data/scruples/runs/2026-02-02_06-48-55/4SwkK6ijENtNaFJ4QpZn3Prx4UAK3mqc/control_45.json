Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who has a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a WWII-era gun from Russia. They put the sticker because they think the rifle might have been used against fascists during the war, and they're into historical guns.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether putting that sticker is insensitive or offensive. The person who criticized the author argued that it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, which the author disagrees with, pointing out the quote's original context from WWII.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was originally used during WWII, associated with the USSR's propaganda. The author is using it in a historical context, referencing the gun's possible role in the past. But in modern times, the phrase might get interpreted differently, especially given current political tensions where \"fascist\" is sometimes used pejoratively in debates.\n\nThe author's intention is historical and not to refer to modern politics. They mention they have another unmodified gun and that the sticker is removable. Their friends supported them, but the critic argues that it's offensive because it could imply a willingness to kill others, similar to how groups today might use such a message.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent vs. perception. The author didn't mean to offend and was referencing historical usage. However, the sticker's message might be misinterpreted by others, especially if they don't share the historical knowledge. The critic's point is valid because the phrase can be seen as a call to violence, even if the author's intent is different.\n\nBut then again, the author is using a historical artifact in a historical way. They didn't modify the gun permanently and are aware of its history. The phrase is tied to a specific historical moment. The problem arises when the context isn't clear to everyone. The author might not be in the wrong because their intent was historical, but they might not have considered the modern implications enough. However, since the phrase itself is from WWII and the gun is part of that history, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their use is in good faith, historical, and non-offensive in their own context. But they should be aware that others might interpret it differently. So the answer is B (No), because the author's intent was historical, not to offend, and the sticker is part of the historical narrative of the weapon.\n"
