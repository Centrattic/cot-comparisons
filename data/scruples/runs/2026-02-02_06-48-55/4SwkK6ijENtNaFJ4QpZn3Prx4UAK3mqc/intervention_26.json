Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having that \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author explains their reasoning. They're into historical guns and have a Mosin Nagant from WWII. The sticker is a reference to the original WWII context, not modern times. They mention that the phrase was coined by the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" which is Woody Guthrie, right? The original quote was meant to be ironic or provocative, not a direct call to action against fascists. But the author is using it on a rifle they shoot at the range for fun, and they argue it's about the gun's possible historical role, not current intentions.\n\nThe problem arose when someone at the range found the sticker offensive or insensitive. The author defended it by pointing out the historical context and that the sticker can be removed. Their friends agreed with them, but the author is doubting if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical and not tied to modern politics, but the sticker's wording could be interpreted as implying a current desire to kill people, especially if someone doesn't know the historical context. The person who objected felt it was similar to using the phrase against other groups, which could be problematic. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is known from WWII, but using it on a modern gun might blur the line between historical reference and modern implication. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because their intent was educational and historical. However, the sticker could still be seen as insensitive because it's on a weapon, even if it's an antique. The line between honoring history and making a provocative statement can be thin. Since the author acknowledges that the person's point isn't entirely baseless, maybe there's a valid concern about how others perceive it, even if their intention is pure. So, while the author may not be in the wrong in their own defense, the situation is nuanced. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the intent is clear and the sticker is removable, maybe they're not. But the potential for misinterpretation exists. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether intent matters more than perception. In a public setting like a shooting range, the perception is important. Even if the author's intent is historical, others might see it as promoting violence against a group. Woody Guthrie's original quote was a protest song line, not meant to endorse violence, but the phrasing can be jarring. The author's defense that the gun is just for shooting paper might not fully address the concern. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because the sticker could be perceived as offensive regardless of intent. Alternatively, if the author made it clear it was a historical reference, perhaps not. But since they didn't mention explaining it to the person who objected, maybe they should have considered the broader implications. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because their intent is historical and educational, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because the sticker can be seen as inappropriate regardless of intent. This is tricky.\n"
