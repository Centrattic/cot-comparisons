Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a WWII-era gun. The person argues that the sticker is a historical reference, given that the rifle might have been used during the war. But someone else found it insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the sticker. The original phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a WWII poster, right? So it was a propaganda piece from that time, meant to encourage enlistment or support. The author is using it on a historical weapon that was actually used in the war. They say it's a joke, referencing the rifle's possible past. \n\nThe person who confronted them is saying that the sticker implies the author would use the rifle to kill people now, which is offensive. The author argues that it's not meant for the modern political context, but the other person is making a comparison to using similar stickers with other ideologies. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention is historical, but others might interpret it differently. The key points are intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean it to be offensive, but if someone finds it offensive, does that make the author wrong? \n\nAlso, considering the current climate, terms like \"fascists\" can be politically charged. Even if the phrase is from WWII, using it on a gun might be seen as trivializing violence or making a modern political statement. The author's friends supported them, but public perception might vary. \n\nGun ownership and historical items can be sensitive topics. The sticker is on a functional gun, which might trigger different reactions. The author argues that the gun is for historical purposes and shooting at the range, not for actual harm. But the sticker could still be seen as insensitive if it's perceived as endorsing violence against a modern group labeled as \"fascists.\"\n\nIn debates like these, it's often about how the message is received. If the author's intention is clear to them and their friends, but others take offense, there's a conflict. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was historical, but they could be misunderstanding the current sensitivities. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the context of the sticker is clearly historical or if it's likely to be misinterpreted. Since the author is aware of the original context but others aren't, and the comparison is made to modern uses, there might be a case for the author not being in the wrong. However, the potential for offense exists regardless of intent. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because their intent was historical and the sticker's origin is from WWII. However, this is a nuanced situation where intent vs. impact plays a role. But since the question is asking if they are in the wrong, and the author didn't intend to be offensive, the answer would lean towards B.\n"
