Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The situation involves a discussion with a friend who found it offensive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a historical interest in guns, specifically a WWII-era Russian rifle. The sticker references a quote from WWII, used by Pete Seeger. The author's intention is historical, noting that the rifle might have been used in that period. The friend argues that the sticker could imply the author uses the gun to kill people now, which is offensive.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent vs. the perceived meaning by others. The author claims the sticker is a historical reference, but others might interpret it differently. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author's intent is clear to them, but public perception and the potential for misinterpretation are factors. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historical, but using it on a modern gun, even if it's an antique, might be seen as insensitive because it could be interpreted as endorsing violence against a group. The author mentions that the gun is now used for target practice, which is different from actual killing, but the sticker's presence could still be jarring.\n\nThe author's friends support them, but the opposing view is valid. The line between historical reference and offensive implication can be thin. Even if the author didn't mean it to relate to modern politics, the sticker could evoke that connection. The friend's argument is that it's similar to using the phrase against other groups, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If the author's intent is purely historical and they don't mean to endorse violence now, but the sticker still could be misinterpreted, it's a gray area. However, considering that the phrase has a historical context and the author is aware of that, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But there's a possibility they should consider others' feelings. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent is historical and the phrase is from a historical context. However, the sensitivity of the topic is acknowledged. The key is whether the author's intent is clear to others. Since the author made a clear distinction and it's a historical reference, they might not be wrong. But the answer is a bit of a toss-up. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but I might side with B.\n"
