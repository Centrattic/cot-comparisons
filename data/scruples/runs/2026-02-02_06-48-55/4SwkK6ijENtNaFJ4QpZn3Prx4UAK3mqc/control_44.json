Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their WWII-era Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the intent behind it, and the reaction from others.\n\nFirst, the person mentions that the Mosin Nagant was made during WWII and that the sticker is a reference to the historical context of the rifle possibly being used against fascists (like Nazis). They also clarify that they don't use the rifle in the modern political sense but in the historical one. The sticker is removable and applied to a replica or a less valuable gun, as they have another unmodified one from the same era.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies using the gun to kill people now, which is similar to using it to target other groups. The user counters by pointing out that the phrase originated during WWII and is part of that historical context.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are intent, context, and potential offense. The author's intent is historical and educational, referencing a well-known WWII-era slogan. The Mosin Nagant was indeed used by the Soviet Union against Nazis. The sticker isn't permanent, and the author isn't using it in a modern political context. However, the other person felt it was offensive, possibly because the phrase has been co-opted in modern times for different purposes.\n\nBut here's the thing: if the author's intention is purely historical and they're using it in the context of the gun's actual historical use, then it's more of a historical reference rather than a call to action. The original quote from the 1930s was a response to fascism, and the author is using it in that historical sense. Since the gun isn't modified and the sticker is removable, it's more of a hobbyist's way of connecting the artifact to its history.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the intent is historical, the phrase might still be seen as insensitive by some, especially if they associate it with current political movements. However, the author isn't using it to endorse violence against modern groups but rather as a nod to the weapon's past role in WWII. Given that the author explains their reasoning and the context, and their friends support them, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. They made a historical reference, not a modern political statement.\n"
