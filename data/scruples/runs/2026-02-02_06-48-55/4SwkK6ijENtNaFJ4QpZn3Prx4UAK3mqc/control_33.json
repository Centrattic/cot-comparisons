Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue here is about the appropriateness of the sticker given the context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the quote. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historically associated with WWII, particularly with the song \"This Is Thy Hour and Thy Day of Triumph\" by Woody Guthrie, which was used to support soldiers fighting fascism. The user mentions that the rifle itself is a WWII-era Russian gun, which was likely used by Soviet forces against Nazis. So the user is using the quote in its original historical context, acknowledging the rifle's possible past role in WWII.\n\nNext, the person who criticized the sticker argued that it implies the user would use it to kill people now, comparing it to modern ideologies. The user counters that the quote is from the same era as the rifle and not intended to refer to current politics. The friends supported the user, but he's feeling conflicted.\n\nI should think about whether the sticker's meaning is clear. The user's intent is historical, but others might interpret it differently. The key here is the intent versus the perception. The user didn't mean to reference modern politics, but the critic found it offensive because it could be seen as trivializing the use of weapons today. However, the user also explains that the sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified rifle, showing respect for the historical piece.\n\nThe quote's original context is important. Since it's a historical reference, the user is aligning the rifle's past with the quote. The critic's comparison to modern ideologies might be a stretch if the user's intent is purely historical. However, the phrase can be sensitive because \"fascists\" today are associated with far-right movements. The user clarifies that they don't mean to imply using the gun for modern purposes, but others might not get that nuance.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the shooting range and the audience, some people might be more sensitive about gun-related items. The user's friends supported them, which suggests that the immediate social circle didn't find it offensive. But the critic's perspective is valid in that any phrase like that could be misinterpreted, especially in current political climates.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intent is historical and not to offend, which is clear from their explanation. While others might take offense, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're using the quote in its original context and are respectful of the historical significance. The critic's concern is understandable, but the user's explanation shows they didn't intend to trivialize the phrase in a modern sense. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
