Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest, and they have a WWII-era Russian rifle. The sticker they put on it references a historical slogan from WWII, coined by Woody Guthrie. They argue that the rifle itself might have been used against Nazis, and now it's just for target practice. \n\nThe friend who criticized it said it could imply using the gun to kill people now, which the author disagrees with, pointing out the historical origin of the phrase. The author's friends support them, but they're still unsure.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the phrase \"This machine kills fascists\" is historically tied to WWII and was used in a different context. The author is using it in a historical reference, not making a political statement today. The friend's objection is about possible modern implications, but the author clarifies they don't mean it in the current political sense.\n\nThe key points are intention vs. perception. The author intended it as a historical nod, but others might misinterpret it. However, given that the phrase has a specific historical context and the author explains their reasoning, it's more about personal interpretation. The author isn't making a modern political statement, so they aren't being insensitve in that regard. The friend's comparison to using it against other groups is flawed because the phrase is linked to WWII Nazis specifically.\n\nAlso, the rifle is a historical artifact, and the sticker is removable. The author isn't modifying the gun permanently and has another unmodified one. So, the action is more of a personal expression of historical interest rather than an offensive act.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because their intention was historical and the sticker is a reference to a past context. The misunderstanding comes from others interpreting it in a modern light without considering the historical background. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
