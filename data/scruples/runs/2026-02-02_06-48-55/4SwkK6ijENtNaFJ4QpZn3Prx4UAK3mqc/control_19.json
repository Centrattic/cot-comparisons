Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sticker on a historical gun.\n\nFirst, the author has a Mosin Nagant from WWII and put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on it. They mention that the original quote is from WWII, associated with Woody Guthrie. The context here is historical, so the author is using a historical reference. The person who criticized the sticker found it insensitive, implying it might suggest the author would use the gun against others today. \n\nThe key points are the intent versus the perception. The author's intention is to reference historical use, not modern politics. They also clarify that the gun is for historical shooting, not for actual combat. However, the critic argued that the sticker could be seen as implying current intentions. \n\nThe author's friends supported them, and they have another unmodified gun. The sticker is removable, so it's not permanent. The phrase itself is a historical quote, not a new invention, so using it in that context might be reasonable. \n\nBut does using the sticker in this way trivialize the original intent or make it insensitive? The author didn't mean to reference modern politics, but the phrase \"This Machine Kills...\" is often associated with anti-fascist rhetoric. The critic might have felt that putting it on a weapon, even historically, could be seen as mocking or insensitively referencing real violence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using it to connect the gun's history with the quote's origin, which is also WWII. The problem seems to be a difference in perspective: the author sees it as a historical nod, while the critic sees it as potentially offensive in a modern context. \n\nSince the author's intent was not to offend and the sticker is tied to historical context, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a chance that the sticker could be misinterpreted, even if unintentionally. The question is whether intent matters more than perception. \n\nIn AITA situations, both sides can have valid points. The author's explanation seems genuine, and the sticker is removable and historical. The critic's concern is about the modern implication. However, since the author didn't intend to mock or offend, and the context is historical, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
