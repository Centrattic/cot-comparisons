Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the historical reference, and the reaction from someone else.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the sticker is a historical reference. The original phrase was used during WWII, so the user is trying to connect it to the rifle's possible use in that era. They also note that the rifle is an antique and that the sticker can be easily removed. Their friends support them, and they argue that the sticker isn't meant to imply modern political statements.\n\nThe person who found it offensive suggested that it could be interpreted as implying the user would use the gun to kill others now. But the user counters that it's a historical nod, not a modern one. The user is conflicted but leaning towards thinking they might be in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering intent vs. impact. The user's intent was historical, but others might take it differently. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed from WWII, but using it on a gun today could be seen as trivializing the original context or potentially inciting violence if someone misinterprets it. However, the user clarifies they're using it in the same way as other historical references, and the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people.\n\nThe debate here is whether the context is clear enough. If the user explains the historical background, maybe the sticker is fine. But in a public setting without explanation, others might not know the history and could take offense. The user's friends understood the context, but the person who complained didn't. So, the issue is about how the sticker is perceived by others who might not share the same knowledge.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, since the user is in a position where others might misinterpret it, even if unintentionally, there's a case for being insensitive. But the user's explanation does show they're aware of the history. The line between historical appreciation and potentially offensive use is thin here. The user might not be in the wrong, but they should consider the audience and context more carefully. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with a nuance that sensitivity is needed.\n"
