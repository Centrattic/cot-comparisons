Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for putting the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have a passion for history and guns, and they collect historical firearms. The Mosin Nagant in question is a WWII-era Russian rifle. The sticker they put on it is a reference to a quote from WWII, specifically from the song \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" by Woody Guthrie. The author explains that the original quote refers to the political context of the time, not modern times. They argue that since the gun is historical and the sticker is a nod to its past, it's not offensive. However, someone at the shooting range found the sticker insensitive, suggesting it could imply the author might use it to kill people today, especially if the phrase was rephrased to target other groups.\n\nThe author's defense is that the phrase is tied to the historical context and not the current political climate. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same gun. Their friends supported them, but they're still unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering different perspectives. The author's intention is clearly historical and not to promote violence today. They acknowledge the historical context and use the phrase as a joke or a nod to the gun's past. However, the counterargument is that the phrase, when applied to a modern gun, could be seen as implying current political messaging. The person who criticized it compared it to using similar phrases to target other ideologies, which the author finds a bad comparison because the original phrase is from WWII.\n\nI need to consider if the author's action is insensitive regardless of their intent. The key points are the historical reference versus the modern interpretation. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a well-known historical quote, so using it in a historical context might be seen as appropriate. However, some might argue that even with good intent, the phrase could be misinterpreted or used to justify violence in a modern context. But the author clarifies they don't intend it that way and the gun is for shooting paper, not people.\n\nThe person who criticized them might be overreacting if the author's intention is purely historical. On the other hand, if someone else sees it as a modern statement, the author might not be at fault because their intent was different. The answer hinges on whether intent matters in this case.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using historical references on historical objects can be acceptable, especially if they're part of the object's history. The author also mentions that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun, which suggests they aren't altering the artifact in a permanent way. Their friends supported them, which adds to the argument that the context is important.\n\nHowever, the person who found it offensive might have a valid point if the phrase is taken out of its original context and could be seen as promoting violence today. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, but the concern is about the potential misinterpretation.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the author's intent, the historical context, and the fact that the sticker is temporary, it's more likely that they are not in the wrong. The criticism might stem from a misunderstanding of the historical reference rather than the author's malicious intent. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
