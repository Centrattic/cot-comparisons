Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person loves history and guns. They have a Mosin Nagant made during WWII in Tula. They put a WWII-era quote on it, which was originally from a different context. The person argues that the rifle might have actually been used against fascists during the war, and now it's just for shooting at paper. The sticker is meant to reference the historical context, not modern politics. However, someone else found it offensive, suggesting it implies the owner might use it to kill people now, similar to a modern political statement. The friends sided with the owner, but they're wondering if they're wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent versus the perception. The owner's intent is historical, referencing the original WWII use. The original quote was indeed from Woody Guthrie during the war, so it's not a modern invention. The owner isn't using it in a current political context, just tying the rifle's history to the quote.\n\nBut the other person's concern is that the sticker could be misinterpreted as supporting violence against a group today. Even if the owner didn't mean that, the sticker's wording might be jarring to some. The phrase \"kills Fascists\" has a powerful meaning, and while it was specific to WWII, modern issues with far-right groups make \"fascists\" a term that might be linked to current ideologies. So, could the sticker be seen as insensitive in today's climate?\n\nAlso, the fact that the owner has a historical item doesn't negate the potential for misinterpretation. Even if the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version, the presence of the sticker on a gun, which is a weapon, might be problematic. Guns are often associated with current violence, so the historical context might not be immediately clear to everyone.\n\nThe owner's friends agreed with them, so maybe the social circle is more informed about the history. But the person is questioning if they're wrong. The question is whether intent matters or if the impact is what's important. If the sticker can be seen as offensive to some, even if not the owner's intention, does that make them at fault?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the owner might not be in the wrong because their intent was historical, and the phrase is tied to WWII. However, they could be seen as insensitive if the context isn't clear to others. The other person's point is that the sticker's phrasing, when applied to a modern gun, could imply current violent intent. But the owner is using it for historical reference, not as a political statement now.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the owner is being inconsiderate of others' interpretations. Since the phrase is well-known from WWII and the context is explained, the owner isn't wrong. However, if the sticker causes unnecessary offense, maybe they should consider the impact. But given the historical context and the owner's understanding, I'd lean towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
