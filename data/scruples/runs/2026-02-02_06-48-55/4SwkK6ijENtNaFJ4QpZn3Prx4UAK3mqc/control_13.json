Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this problem. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let's consider the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the rifle is a historical piece from WWII and that the sticker is a reference to the original context of the quote from the 1940s, associated with Woody Guthrie. The author clarifies that the intention is to honor the historical role the rifle might have played during WWII against Nazis. They also note that the sticker is removable and not a permanent modification, and they own another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe person who criticized the author argued that the sticker could imply current intent to use the gun against others, which the author disagrees with, pointing out the historical origin of the phrase. The friends supported the author, but the author is now doubting if it's indeed insensitive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to assess intent vs. perception. The author's intent was historical and not tied to modern politics. However, the criticism came from someone who perceived it as offensive because it might suggest a modern violent intent. The controversy arises from how the message is interpreted today, even if the original context is historical.\n\nThe key factors here are:\n1. **Intent**: The author's intention was historical, not to make a modern political statement.\n2. **Perception**: Others might interpret the sticker as implying current violent actions, especially given the modern use of similar phrases for political purposes.\n3. **Context**: The original quote is from a different era, but the reuse of such phrases can have different meanings in today's climate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering modern sensitivities. Even if their intent was historical, the sticker could still be seen as insensitive if it's perceived as trivializing violence or making a modern political statement. The author argues against the comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies, but the critic's point is about the implication of using the gun for current purposes.\n\nIn such cases, the line between historical reference and modern insensitivity can be blurry. If the author is aware that their action might be misinterpreted or cause discomfort, even if unintended, there could be a case for being in the wrong. However, the author's defense is that the context is historical and the sticker is a nod to that history, not a modern statement.\n\nConsidering both perspectives, the answer hinges on whether intent alone absolves the action or if the potential for misinterpretation matters. Given that the author is reflecting on whether it's \"kinda trashy\" and acknowledges the friend's criticism, there's an element of responsibility in considering how others might see it. However, the phrase's historical roots and the author's clarification might mitigate the offense.\n\nBut since the main argument is about the sticker implying current violent intent, and the author's intent is historical, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as long as the action isn't causing direct harm and the intent is clear. However, there's a gray area here where some might still find it offensive regardless of intent. The question's context is about whether the author is in the wrong, and if the answer is based on intent versus perception, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but they might need to consider others' feelings.\n"
