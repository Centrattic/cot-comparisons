Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points are the context of the sticker, the historical reference, and the reaction from someone else.\n\nFirst, the author explains their reasoning: the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and the sticker references a historical quote from WWII. They argue it's a nod to the gun's possible past use against Nazis, not a modern political statement. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another similar rifle.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker felt it was insensitive, possibly implying the author would use it to kill others. The author counters that the phrase is from the same era as the gun and not a modern reference. Friends supported them, but the author is unsure.\n\nI need to consider if the author's intentions matter here. Since the author's intent was historical and not to offend, but the sticker could be misinterpreted. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historical, but in today's context, associating it with a gun might still be seen as insensitive, especially with current political climates. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the potential for misunderstanding exists. The key is whether the action (putting the sticker) is wrong regardless of intent. \n\nAlso, the person who criticized it made a comparison to other ideologies, which the author finds unfair. However, the author's argument about historical context is valid. But maybe the issue is that the sticker could be seen as trivializing a serious historical event or making a political statement. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author isn't using the gun in a harmful way now, but the sticker's placement on a firearm might still be problematic. If someone else finds it offensive, even if the author didn't intend to, does that make the author in the wrong? It's possible the answer hinges on societal norms and sensitivities. Since the author is questioning their own actions and friends supported them, but there's a valid concern from the critic, maybe the answer is nuanced. However, the options are either A or B. Given that the author had good intentions and the sticker is removable, perhaps they are not in the wrong. So leaning towards B, but it's close.\n"
