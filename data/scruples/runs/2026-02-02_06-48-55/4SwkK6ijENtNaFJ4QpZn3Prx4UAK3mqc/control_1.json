Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is at fault. \n\nFirst, the context: The rifle is from WWII, and the sticker is a historical reference. The user explains that the phrase was from WWII, associated with the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land.\" They argue that the sticker refers to the rifle's historical role, not modern implications.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought it was offensive, comparing it to using the phrase to justify killing modern groups. The user counters that the phrase isn't modern, and they don't intend it to relate to current politics.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the sticker is on a historical gun, and the user's intention is to reference historical context. The phrase itself has a historical roots, so using it in that context isn't inherently wrong. The user also mentions they have another unmodified gun, so it's not altering the historical artifact permanently. The friend's objection is about possible modern misinterpretation, but the user didn't intend that. The friends supported the user, and the user themselves feel conflicted but not necessarily wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the user's actions don't seem malicious. They're using a historical reference in a historical context. The issue is more about differing interpretations. Since the user's intent was historical and not to offend, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
