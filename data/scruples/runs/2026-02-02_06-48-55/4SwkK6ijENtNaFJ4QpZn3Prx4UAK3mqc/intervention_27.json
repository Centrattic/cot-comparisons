Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they have a historical interest and the rifle is from WWII. The sticker's phrase was used during WWII, famously by Woody Guthrie. The author uses it as a historical reference, not in a modern political context. They argue that the rifle is part of history and the sticker is a nod to its possible past use against fascists. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker felt it was offensive because it might imply the author uses the gun to kill others now. The author disagrees, pointing out the historical context. Their friends supported them, but the author is unsure.\n\nI need to consider if using a historical reference on a weapon, even with good intentions, could be seen as insensitive. Even if the author's intent is historical, others might perceive it as trivializing the phrase's original meaning or as a modern political statement. The phrase \"kills fascists\" today is often used in protests against far-right ideologies, which might lead some to see it as a call to violence in the present. However, the author's explanation is that they're referencing WWII context.\n\nThe key factors are intent vs. perception. The author likely didn't mean to be offensive, but the concern is that the sticker could be misinterpreted. The critic's point is that the phrase, when attached to a functional gun, might imply current approval of using violence against others, regardless of historical context. The author counters that the phrase is rooted in history and the gun is for historical use, not modern violence.\n\nBalancing these perspectives, the author's action might be seen as insensitive to some because the phrase can take on new meanings in contemporary discourse. Even with good intentions, if a reasonable person could find it offensive, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the context is clearly historical and the author isn't promoting violence, the blame might not lie with them.\n\nConsidering that the phrase is from WWII and the author's use is historical, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the potential for misinterpretation exists. The answer hinges on whether intent or perception is more significant. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on analysis.\n"
