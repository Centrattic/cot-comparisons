Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves some context about their interest in history and guns. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person has a historical rifle from WWII and placed a sticker that's a reference to a historical quote. The quote was coined by Pete Seeger for the folk song, and it's associated with WWII context. The person argues that the sticker refers to the rifle's possible historical role in WWII against Nazis, not implying current political uses.\n\nThe friend who confronted them thinks it's offensive because it could imply using the weapon against modern groups, which the person disagrees with. The user's friends support them, but they're questioning if they are wrong.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive. The person claims historical accuracy and context, while the friend sees a modern implication. The phrase \"kills fascists\" is from a time when it had a clear, positive connotation against Nazis, but today, \"fascist\" is a political term with different usage. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? They didn't intend to refer to modern politics, but others might interpret it differently. However, the sticker's origin and the rifle's historical context back up the person's intent. The key here is whether the use of historical terms in this context is acceptable. Since the person is using it in reference to the historical period, they might not be wrong. The friend's comparison to using it against other groups could be a stretch, as the original quote was a protest against actual fascist regimes. \n\nAlso, the Mosin Nagant is a common historical rifle, and the sticker is removable. The person has another unmodified one, so there's no permanent alteration. The main issue is the perception difference between the user and the friend. \n\nIn terms of accountability, unless there's a specific rule against historical references on personal property, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're using a historical quote on a historical weapon, which is part of their hobby. The friend's sensitivity might be based on a different interpretation, but the user's intent was historically grounded. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a historical reference in a historical context, and the sticker doesn't have to carry modern political implications unless someone interprets it that way. The user's explanation supports the historical use, so their intent is valid.\n"
