Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their WWII-era Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the sticker is a historical reference, given the rifle's origin during WWII and the quote's history from that time. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified gun. Their friend found it insensitive, suggesting it implies using the gun to kill people now, which the author disagrees with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was used during WWII, so the author is referencing historical context. However, the friend's concern is about modern implications. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intent was historical, but others might see it differently. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's subjective. Using historical references can be sensitive if it's perceived as trivializing past events or implying support for current ideologies. Even if the author's intention is purely historical, the sticker might still be seen as offensive by some. The fact that friends sided with the author suggests that their perspective is valid, but that doesn't negate the other person's feelings. \n\nThe author isn't using the gun for harm now, and the sticker is on a historical artifact. However, the line between historical appreciation and insensitivity can be thin. The main issue is whether the author's action caused offense. Since the other person felt offended, the author might be seen as insensitive regardless of intent. But since the author had no malicious intent and the sticker is historically accurate in context, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the intent was respectful and historical, and the sticker can be removed. The offense taken is valid, but it's a matter of differing opinions. The author isn't promoting violence now, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
