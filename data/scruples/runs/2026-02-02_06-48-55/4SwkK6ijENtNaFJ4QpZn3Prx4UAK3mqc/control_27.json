Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The context is that the rifle is a WWII-era historical piece, and the person uses it at the shooting range. The sticker was placed jokingly, referencing the historical context where the quote originated. Someone found it offensive, arguing that it implies using the gun to kill people in a modern political context. The user is conflicted, friends supported them, but they're unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the sticker. The user's intention was historical, referencing the original WWII context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Pete Seeger in 1941 for a song, aiming to inspire resistance against fascism during the war. The user's use aligns with that historical reference, not the modern political climate. However, others might misinterpret it as a call to action against current groups, which could be seen as offensive.\n\nGun ownership and historical reenactment or hobby use are common, and modifying historical items (even with removable stickers) isn't inherently wrong unless it's prohibited. The user clarified that the sticker is removable and that they have an unmodified version of the same gun. The argument against the sticker hinges on the perception that it could be interpreted as endorsing violence against people who fit the label \"fascists\" today, which is a sensitive topic given current political tensions. \n\nThe user's friends supported them, suggesting that the community around them understands the historical intent. However, the person who criticized the sticker was concerned about the implication that the user might use the gun for modern political purposes. The user's defense is that the phrase is a historical reference, which is valid, but the ambiguity in interpretation is key here. \n\nIn terms of moral or social wrongness, it's about whether the user's action caused unnecessary offense. Since the sticker can be seen as insensitive by others, even if unintended, the user might be at fault for not considering how others could misinterpret it. On the other hand, if the user's intent was purely historical and they were aware of the phrase's origin, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nThe answer likely depends on whose perspective you take. If the user is in a community where historical context is well understood, they're probably fine. In a broader context where others might not get the reference, it's more problematic. The user wasn't advocating violence, but the sticker's placement on a real gun could be seen as trivializing the weapon's purpose. \n\nConsidering all this, the user might not be in the wrong since their intent was respectful of history, and they were aware of the phrase's origins. However, there's a valid argument that the sticker could be misinterpreted, but that's a matter of perspective. The key is that there's no malicious intent here, just a differing interpretation. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
