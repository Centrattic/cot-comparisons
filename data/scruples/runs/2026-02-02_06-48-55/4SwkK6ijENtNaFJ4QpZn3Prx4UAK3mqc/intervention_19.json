Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation is that someone at the shooting range found it offensive. The person argues that the phrase is from WWII and relates to that context, not modern politics. They also mention that the gun is historical and the sticker is removable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original quote was from WWII, so the author is using historical reference. But the question is whether putting it on a gun today is insensitive. The person who criticized it said it could imply the user would use the gun to kill people now. The author counters that the phrase is historical and not meant to reference current issues.\n\nNow, the key points are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is to connect the historical context of the gun and the quote. However, others might see it as weaponizing the phrase, suggesting violence in a modern context. Since the gun is a historical piece, some might see it as a respectful nod, while others might find it offensive, especially given the current political climate and how the phrase is sometimes used today.\n\nAlso, the author has another unmodified gun, which shows they aren't altering historical items for show. But the sticker is on one of them. The fact that it's a removable sticker could be a point in their favor, as it's not permanent. However, the act of putting the sticker there might still be seen as insensitive by some.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, but the critic's point is valid too. The phrase can be interpreted in different ways. The author didn't mean to imply modern usage, but the perception is that it could be a call to action against current ideologies. Since intent isn't always what others perceive, the author might be in a gray area.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action caused offense, even if unintended, does that make them responsible? The answer might depend on cultural sensitivity. Even if the phrase is historical, using it in this context could be seen as dismissive of modern concerns. Therefore, perhaps the author is at least partially in the wrong. But the answer might be nuanced.\n"
