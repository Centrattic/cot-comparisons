Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. The rifle is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Russia. The sticker is a historical reference, as the original quote was from the 1940s. The controversy arose when someone found the sticker offensive, suggesting it implies the author uses the gun to kill people now, especially given modern political associations of the term \"fascist.\"\n\nThe author argues that the phrase has historical context and isn't meant to reference modern politics. They mention that the quote was from the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" which is relevant. They also note that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified rifle.\n\nThe person who objected compared it to putting similar stickers with different ideologies, suggesting it's insensitive. The author's friends agreed with them, but they're still questioning if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the intent vs. the perception. The author's intent was historical, referencing WWII. However, the sticker could be interpreted as equating modern political groups with Nazis, which is a sensitive comparison. The person who objected felt it was offensive because it might imply support for using violence against others, which is a valid concern even if the author didn't intend it.\n\nThe phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is tied to a specific historical context, but in modern times, the term \"fascists\" is often used pejoratively for various groups. The author might not be aware of how the phrase is perceived today. Even if the author's intention was purely historical, the sticker's presence on a gun could be seen as trivializing the violence of the past or suggesting that they're ready to use the gun against people they label as \"fascists\" now. That could be dangerous or offensive, especially in a polarized climate.\n\nHowever, the author does have a point about the historical accuracy. The original quote was from WWII, and the rifle itself was used in that context. But the issue is whether the sticker's placement on a modern gun changes the perception. Even if the gun is historical, the sticker might still imply a readiness to use it in a way that others find offensive.\n\nAnother angle: the author uses guns for sport and historical appreciation, not for aggression. But the sticker could still be seen as provocative. The person who objected might be overreacting, but their concern is valid. The author might not be in the wrong if they had no malicious intent, but the sticker's message could be insensitive regardless of intent.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's intent is historical, but the sticker's potential to be offensive is a real issue. The answer hinges on whether intent or the impact is more important. Since the AITA format usually considers both, but the community often emphasizes the impact on others. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), because even if unintended, the sticker could be seen as promoting violence or making an inflammatory comparison.\n"
