Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a historical gun from WWII. The person argues that the sticker is a reference to the historical context, specifically WWII when that quote was used. The person who criticized them said it's offensive and could imply the author would use the gun to kill people now, which the author denies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The original phrase was used during WWII as a propaganda slogan, so the author is referencing historical events. The author mentions that the gun is part of their interest in history and that they use it for shooting at a range, not for harmful purposes. The sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe critic's argument is that the sticker could be seen as implying the author wants to kill people now, especially with the current political climate. But the author insists they never meant it that way and that the reference is purely historical. Also, friends supported them, indicating that others understand the historical context.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and perception. The author's intent was historical and not to offend, which is clear. However, symbols and phrases can carry different meanings for different people. The critic might have felt targeted or uncomfortable, especially if they associate the phrase with modern political issues. But given that the phrase has a well-established historical origin, the author might be justified in using it in that context.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being responsible by using an easily removable sticker and not modifying the gun. They also have another unaltered gun, so it's not about defacing an artifact. The key point is whether the use of the historical reference is insensitive now. The author didn't intend to link it to current events, but the critic might not see that distinction.\n\nIn similar debates, intent matters, but also the impact. Even if unintended, the phrase could be misinterpreted. However, since the author is aware of the historical context and the sticker is on a historical object, it seems like a legitimate reference. The fact that friends supported them suggests that the community they're part of understands the historical aspect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They used a historical phrase on a historical object with no malicious intent. The critic's interpretation might be based on a different perspective, but the author's actions seem reasonable within their context. Therefore, answer B (No) is likely correct.\n"
