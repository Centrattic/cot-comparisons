Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. First, I need to understand the context. The gun is a Mosin Nagant from WWII, and the sticker references a historical quote from WWII, originally used by Pete Seeger. The person argues that the sticker is in reference to the gun's historical use during the war, not a modern political statement.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive. The person who criticized the sticker felt it implied the gun could be used to kill people now, similar to using it for other ideologies. The author argues that since the phrase is from WWII and the gun itself is historical, the context is clear. Their friends supported them, but they're unsure if it's trashy.\n\nI should consider the intent vs. perception. The author's intent was historical, not to make a modern political statement. However, the sticker could be seen as trivializing a serious historical event or misusing the original quote's context. The original quote by Seeger was a satirical response to the FBI's fear of communism, not a direct anti-fascist slogan. But over time, the phrase has been adopted by various groups, which might lead to confusion.\n\nAlso, the fact that the gun is a historical piece and the sticker is removable might mitigate some concerns. The author isn't modifying the gun permanently, and there's another unmodified version. However, the presence of the sticker in a public setting like a shooting range could lead to different interpretations by others. The person who found it offensive made a valid point about the potential implication that the gun is being used for violence now.\n\nBut the author's defense that the phrase is historical and tied to the gun's past is also a strong point. The key here is whether the author's intent aligns with the common understanding of the phrase. If the phrase in the context of a gun today could be misinterpreted, even if not the author's intention, it might be seen as insensitive. However, since the author is using it in a historical context and the phrase itself is a reference to WWII, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nConsidering all sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intent was historical and educational. The sticker is a nod to history, and they're aware of the original quote's significance. The person who criticized might be projecting modern sensitivities onto a historical reference. However, the author could have considered the potential for misinterpretation in a modern context. But given the explanation and context, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
