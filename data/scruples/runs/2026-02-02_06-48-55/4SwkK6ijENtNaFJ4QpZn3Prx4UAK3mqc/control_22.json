Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They want to know if they're being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is into historical guns, has a Mosin Nagant from WWII made in Tula, Russia. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the original WWII context. The origin of the phrase is from Billie Holiday's song, but the user is using it in a historical sense, implying the rifle might have been used against fascists during the war. \n\nNow, someone at the range found it offensive, arguing that it could imply the user would use the gun to kill people now. The user argues that the phrase is historical and not related to modern politics. Their friends support them, but they're questioning if they're being insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the intent vs. perception. The user's intention is to honor the historical context, but the sticker's modern association with political statements might cause misunderstanding. The phrase \"This Machine Kills\" has a strong connotation, even if it's from a different era. People might see it as a glorification of violence or a modern political statement, especially with the gun being a weapon.\n\nHowever, considering that the user is using an actual historical gun and the sticker is a reference to its possible past use, it's a historical nod. The user is not modifying the gun beyond a removable sticker and is careful to preserve the original. But the problem arises in public perception. The person who objected saw it as implying current intent to use the gun to kill people, which could be a stretch, but not entirely without merit. The phrase's ambiguity is the issue here.\n\nThe user's defense that the phrase is from WWII might not fully address the modern context. Even if the phrase is historical, applying it to a gun today, regardless of the intent, could be seen as insensitive because it plays into the idea of using violence against ideologies, which is a sensitive topic. The comparison to other groups might not be fair, but the sticker's potential to be misinterpreted is a valid concern.\n\nSo, balancing intent and impact. The user didn't mean to be offensive, but the sticker could be perceived negatively by others. The answer might depend on whether the intent matters more than the perception. In cases like this, sometimes the impact on others is considered, even if unintended. So the user might not be entirely wrong, but there's a case to be made that the sticker could be seen as insensitive due to its modern associations.\n"
