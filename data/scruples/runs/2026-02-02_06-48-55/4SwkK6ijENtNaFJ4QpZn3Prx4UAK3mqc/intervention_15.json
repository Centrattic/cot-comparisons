Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era historical piece from Russia, and they put the sticker as a historical reference, not in a modern context. They mention that the phrase was coined during WWII, associated with Woody Guthrie.\n\nThe main points here are the context of the sticker and the author's intent. The author claims it's a historical nod, referencing the actual use of such rifles during the war. They also mention the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same rifle. Their friends support them, but a stranger at the range found it offensive, suggesting it could imply the author would use it to kill people now, which the author disagrees with.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are intent and context. The author's intention was to acknowledge the historical context of both the rifle and the quote. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" does have a long history and is often used in a historical context. However, the concern raised by the stranger is about the potential misinterpretation in a modern setting, especially considering the current political climate where \"fascists\" might refer to different groups.\n\nBut the author clarifies they never meant it in a modern political sense and that the phrase was from WWII. The fact that the rifle is used for shooting paper targets at a range, not for actual harm, supports the author's point that it's a historical reference. The removable sticker and the existence of an unmodified rifle also show that the author isn't altering historical artifacts permanently. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the intent is historical, the sticker could still be seen as insensitive to some people, especially those who associate the phrase with modern issues. The author's friends agreed with their reasoning, but others might find it offensive regardless of intent. However, the author's explanation seems genuine and respectful towards the historical significance, which might mitigate the offense.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent was not to be offensive but to connect the rifle's history with the historical quote. The comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies might not hold because the original context is very specific to WWII. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
