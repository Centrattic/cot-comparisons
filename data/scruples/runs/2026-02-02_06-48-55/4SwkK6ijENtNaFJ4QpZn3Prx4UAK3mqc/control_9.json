Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical gun. The user is asking if they're at fault for having it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era Russian rifle. The sticker is a reference to the original WWII quote. The person who confronted them argued that it's offensive and could imply the gun is used to kill people in the modern context. The author explains that the phrase is historical and not meant to reference current politics.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: historical context, intent, and the perception of others. The author uses the sticker in a historical sense, aligning with the rifle's origin. They mention it's a historical reference, not a modern one. The sticker is removable and not on an original artifact, as they have another unmodified gun. Their friends supported them, but the other person felt offended.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their intent and action cross into modern political statements. The original quote was from WWII, so using it on a historical gun seems appropriate. However, in today's climate, some might see it as a modern political statement, especially with the rise of certain ideologies. The author argues against that interpretation, but others might still take offense. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a balance between personal expression and sensitivity. Since the author's intent was historical and the sticker is removable, it's not damaging the gun's authenticity. The person who took offense made a comparison to modern ideologies, which the author rejects. \n\nIn such cases, it's often subjective. The author isn't using it to promote violence but to acknowledge history. Unless there's a direct link to harmful intent, they might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
