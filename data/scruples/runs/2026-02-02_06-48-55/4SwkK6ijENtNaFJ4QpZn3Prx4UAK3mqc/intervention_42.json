Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the gun's history, and the reaction from another person.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era Russian rifle, and the sticker references the original WWII-era quote by Frank Loesser, which was used for propaganda. The author's intention was to connect the rifle's historical role during WWII, where it might have been used against fascists, hence the sticker. They mention that the sticker is removable and they own an unmodified version as well, so this isn't about modifying a historical artifact permanently.\n\nThe other person at the range found it offensive, arguing that it implies the author would use it to kill others now, drawing a comparison to modern political ideologies. The author counters by saying the phrase is historical and not meant to reference current issues. Friends supported the author, but they're questioning if they're wrong.\n\nNow, to decide if they're in the wrong, I need to consider intent vs. impact. The author's intent was historical, but the sticker's phrasing, even if historically accurate, might be perceived as insensitive today. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is associated with WWII, but using it on a gun that people can see might be confusing. Some might see it as a joke or historical reference, others might see it as trivializing the serious context of actual fascist violence, or even as promoting violence. The author argues it's about history, but the line between historical reference and modern implication can be blurry.\n\nAlso, even if the phrase is from WWII, attaching it to a functional gun could be seen as making a statement about current uses. The person who found it offensive made that point, suggesting that the sticker could imply the gun is meant for killing people now, which the author denies. However, symbols on weapons can carry strong connotations, and even if the intent is purely historical, the perception matters. \n\nThe author's friends sided with them, which shows that perspective varies. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If someone's action causes offense, even if unintentionally, there's a case to be made that they should reconsider. The author could remove the sticker to avoid the issue. Since the author acknowledges that others found it offensive and is now questioning their own stance, it might be fair to say they are partly at fault for not anticipating the potential for misunderstanding or offense, even if their intent was good.\n\nSo, considering intent vs. impact, the author might not be entirely wrong, but there's a responsibility to be aware of how symbols are perceived. The answer could lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because the sticker, regardless of historical context, might be seen as insensitive in the current climate. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the historical context is sufficient. But given that the author was made aware of the offense and is now doubting, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author can easily remove the sticker and the phrase's original context is well-known, maybe B is more appropriate. Wait, but the argument is that using it on a gun now might imply current usage. Hmm. I think the key is that the author's action caused offense, even if unintended. So maybe A is correct. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The original quote was a propaganda piece, but putting it on a gun today might confuse people. The author's explanation is valid, but the perception is that the sticker could be endorsing violence. So, the author is in the wrong for not considering that perspective. So answer A.\n"
