Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They mention that the rifle is from WWII and that the sticker is a joke based on the historical context. The person who confronted them argued that it's insensitive and could imply using the gun to kill people today, which the author disagrees with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the phrase. It's a well-known WWII slogan from Woody Guthrie, right? So the author is referencing historical use. But the problem is whether that's a sensitive or offensive thing to do now. The person who brought it up felt it was implying that the author uses the gun for that purpose today, even though the author says it's just a historical nod. \n\nThe author's intention is key here. They claim it's not about modern politics and that they see it as a historical reference. However, the sticker's placement on a functional gun might lead others to misinterpret it, especially in today's climate. Guns are a sensitive topic, and even if the author didn't mean it, the message could be seen as provocative. The fact that the rifle is part of their hobby and they have another unmodified one suggests they respect the historical aspect, but the sticker might trivialize the serious history of WWII. \n\nAlso, the argument is that using such a slogan on a gun, even if it's a historical one, could be seen as using a weapon to make a political statement. The comparison to other ideologies is a red herring in a way, but the main issue is the potential insensitivity. People might associate the slogan with glorifying violence or insensitivity towards those affected by fascism. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't modify the gun permanently and the sticker can be removed. Their friends support them, which shows some social context where it's not seen as wrong by their peers. But public perception and the potential for misunderstanding are important factors. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author's intent is historical and not malicious, but the sticker's message could be perceived as insensitive because it uses a serious historical slogan in a context that might be seen as flippant. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because their intention was respectful and the sticker is removable, but some might argue that even the perception of insensitivity could be a problem. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe there's a split here. But I need to stick to the options. The key is whether the action is \"kinda trashy.\" If the community standards or the person's intent were clear, then maybe not. But the author's own doubt suggests they're uncertain, which complicates things. Since the sticker can be removed and the author's explanation is historical, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
