Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a WWII-era rifle is in the wrong. The author explains their reasoning: they love guns and history, the rifle is from WWII, and the phrase was a reference to its historical context. They mention the origin of the phrase, co-created by Woody Guthrie, and that it's not meant to relate to modern politics. Some people found it offensive, arguing it could imply using the gun to kill people today. Friends supported the author, but they're unsure.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the intent vs. perception. The author's intention was historical and nostalgic, using a WWII slogan. However, the sticker's presence on a modern gun might be misinterpreted in today's political climate. The phrase is historically accurate, but when applied to a current firearm, even a historical one, it might be seen as insensitive or provocative because it's associated with violence and modern ideologies.\n\nThe author's defense is that the context is WWII, but others might not make that distinction. The person who confronted them argues that the sticker could imply a desire to engage in violence against certain groups today. Even if the author doesn't mean that, the sticker's message might be weaponized in a way that's offensive.\n\nThe author also mentions that the gun is modified with a sticker, which could be seen as altering a historical artifact. However, they note that it's easy to remove and they have another unmodified one. But the issue isn't just about modification; it's about the message conveyed.\n\nConsidering that the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a protest against war and the military-industrial complex, using it on a gun might be contradictory. The original intent was to criticize the glorification of weapons, so applying it to a gun for personal use could be seen as missing that point.\n\nAlso, the author's friends supported them, but that doesn't mean the concern isn't valid. The key here is whether the author should have considered how others might interpret the sticker, regardless of their intent. Since the phrase can be associated with current political tensions and the context of using weapons against people, it's possible that the author's action was insensitive even if unintentional.\n\nSo, weighing intent against potential impact, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for argument. However, given the sensitivity around such phrases and the potential for misinterpretation, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the modern implications, even if their intent was historical.\n"
