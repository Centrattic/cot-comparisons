Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun. The author explains that the gun is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Russia, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing the historical context of the quote. They were at a shooting range with friends when someone called the sticker insensitive and offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the quote. \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a famous slogan from WWII, associated with the film \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and often used during the war. The author's intention is to connect the gun's historical use during WWII with the original meaning of the slogan.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argues that it's offensive because it could imply the author would use the gun to kill people now, especially in the current political climate. The author counters that they're not using it in a modern political context and that the quote is from a specific historical period.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the perception of others. The author's friends supported them, but the critic felt it was offensive. The question is whether the author's action is insensitive, regardless of their intent.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might not have intended any modern political connotations, but the phrase \"fascists\" is currently used in various political discussions. Even if the author's intent is purely historical, the sticker's presence on a gun\u2014a weapon\u2014could be seen as trivializing the historical context or making a political statement.\n\nAlso, the fact that the gun is a historical piece might mitigate some of the criticism, but the sticker's placement on a functioning weapon (even if it's for historical shooting) might still be seen as inappropriate by some. The comparison to putting similar stickers about other ideologies suggests that the critic is concerned about the potential for misuse or the implication of violence towards a group.\n\nHowever, the author argues that the phrase is not a modern invention and is tied to its original use. Since they acknowledge the historical context and the sticker is removable, maybe there's less intent to offend. But intent isn't always the main factor in such situations; perception and impact can also play a role.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their use is rooted in historical context and they made it clear they're not referring to modern politics. However, others might still find it offensive regardless of intent. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't mean to be offensive and the sticker is a historical reference, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the sticker's placement on a gun could reasonably be seen as promoting violence or making a modern political statement, then maybe they are. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer leans more towards \"No\" (B), the author is not in the wrong, but there's a valid argument on both sides. Since the user is asking for a definitive answer, I need to pick A or B. The key is whether the author's action was insensitive. Given their explanation and the historical context, it's more about historical appreciation rather than modern political statement, so B might be the better choice.\n"
