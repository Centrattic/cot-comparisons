Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They provided both sides of the argument.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they're a history enthusiast, the rifle is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant, and the sticker is a reference to a WWII-era slogan. They argue that the sticker is historical and not meant to imply modern political intent. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. Their friends supported them, but they're feeling conflicted.\n\nThe other person's perspective is that the sticker is offensive because it might imply the author would use the gun to kill others now, comparing it to putting similar stickers for other ideologies or groups. The author counters that the phrase isn't modern and was from the same era as the gun.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical, but the sticker's presence on a modern gun might be seen as insensitive by others. The phrase \"killing fascists\" has a historical context, but in today's climate, it can be polarizing. Even if the author didn't mean it for modern politics, others might interpret it that way. The comparison to using similar stickers for other groups is a valid concern because it could be seen as dehumanizing or promoting violence against a group. \n\nHowever, the author is using a historical reference on a historical object, which could be seen as a legitimate historical nod. The fact that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified gun might mitigate some of the criticism. But the main issue is whether using a WWII slogan on a weapon in a modern context, even jokingly, is considered insensitive. \n\nThe person who confronted them argued that it implies the gun is for killing people now, not just for historical reasons. The author's defense is that the original context is from WWII, same as the gun. But the problem is that the phrase can be appropriated in modern contexts, and even if the author isn't intending that, the sticker might still be offensive to some. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent is clear, but the potential for offense exists because of the symbol's modern usage. The question is whether the author should have considered that their action might be perceived negatively. Since the sticker is on a gun, which is a weapon, combining it with a phrase about killing, even historically, can be seen as problematic. The author might not be in the wrong if they intended it purely historically, but the sensitivity of others is a factor. \n\nSo, the answer depends on weighing intent against potential offense. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for understanding the other person's perspective. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The correct answer here is B (No, not in the wrong) because the author's intent was historical and non-offensive, and the sticker is removable. The comparison to modern issues is a stretch, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
