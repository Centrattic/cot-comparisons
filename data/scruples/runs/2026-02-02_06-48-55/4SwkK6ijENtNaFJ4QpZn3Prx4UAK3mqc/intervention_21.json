Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a historical gun from WWII and put a sticker that references a famous quote from WWII. The quote was originally used by Pete Seeger in the 1950s as a protest against McCarthyism, but it's commonly associated with WWII. The author's intention is to connect the rifle's historical context with the original quote's purpose. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive. The person who criticized the author argues that it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, which is a modern political statement. The author defends by saying the phrase is rooted in WWII history and not meant for modern contexts.\n\nI need to consider if the sticker's message is inherently offensive. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference, but in today's climate, \"fascists\" can be a charged term. Even if the author's intention is historical, others might interpret it as a call to action or as supporting violence against certain groups. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the gun is used for shooting at a range, not for harm. But the sticker's wording might still be seen as provocative. The fact that others found it offensive suggests that there's a reason to reconsider. The author's friends agreed with them, but others might not. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical appreciation, but the perception could be different. Even if the phrase has historical roots, using it on a gun might trivialize the serious nature of actual violence. Also, the comparison to modern ideologies could be seen as insensitive if it's used in a way that's dismissive of current political tensions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the sticker could be reasonably perceived as offensive by others, even if the author didn't intend it that way, there's a case to be made that the author should be considerate of others' feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was purely historical, but the potential for misunderstanding is there. However, since the author chose to put the sticker on a gun, which is a weapon, the message might be more easily misinterpreted as endorsing violence.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have anticipated the sticker's possible offensive nature. The author's friends sided with them, but the original poster is questioning if they're in the wrong. Since the sticker can be seen as insensitive regardless of intent, especially when applied to a functional weapon, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they should have foreseen the potential for offense.\n"
