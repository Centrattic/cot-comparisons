Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a WWII-era Russian gun. They argue that the phrase is historical, from WWII and the same person who wrote \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" and that the gun itself might have been used against fascists during the war. The person who confronted them said it's offensive because it could imply they want to use it to kill people now, similar to using other ideologies in the phrase. The author's friends support them, but they're unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed a historical reference from WWII, used during the war to encourage support for the war effort. The author is using it in connection with a rifle from that era, which might have been part of that history. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified gun, so it's not altering the historical artifact permanently. \n\nThe other person's concern is that the sticker could be seen as offensive because it might suggest the author is equating their hobby with modern violence. The comparison to putting a sticker for any ideology is a point against, but the author counters that the phrase is specifically tied to WWII context. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and perception. The author's intention is clearly to reference historical context, not to make a modern political statement. However, the sticker could be misinterpreted by others, especially in today's climate where \"fascist\" is sometimes used more broadly. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the sticker might be seen as insensitive to those who associate the phrase with current issues. \n\nBut the author is using a historical phrase on a historical gun, which is part of their hobby. They have a legitimate interest in history and are not modifying the gun beyond a removable sticker. The other person's argument that it implies intent to use the gun for violence today may not hold, since the gun is for target practice, not people. However, the phrase's original use was during war, so there's a historical connection.\n\nI think the key points are: intent vs. perception, the historical context of both the phrase and the gun, and whether the sticker's presence is inherently offensive. Since the author didn't mean to imply modern violence and the sticker is a historical reference, they might not be wrong. However, because it can be perceived as insensitive regardless of intent, there could be validity to the other person's concern. \n\nBut since the question is about the author being in the wrong, and the author's actions were not malicious, just a historical nod, the answer might be B (No). However, if the community or social norms in their area consider such stickers offensive even in historical context, then maybe A. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's intent was historical and not to offend, and the sticker is removable, it's more about differing opinions rather than being wrong. So probably B.\n"
