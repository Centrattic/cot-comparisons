Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and they put the sticker as a historical reference, not as a modern political statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the phrase. The quote is from WWII, associated with Pete Seeger and used in a different historical period. The author is using it to reference the rifle's possible role in that era. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they own another unmodified gun, so they're being considerate about preserving the antique's original state.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, drawing a comparison to other ideologies. The author counters that the phrase is historical and not meant for modern politics. Their friends agree with them.\n\nNow, the key points are intent and interpretation. The author's intent was historical, but others might interpret it differently. The question is whether the author is wrong for using the sticker despite their intent. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author didn't mean to offend, but others might find the association with current events problematic. However, the author isn't using the gun for violence now, and the sticker is a historical reference. Given that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intention was educational and respectful, even if others take offense. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the context and intent are clear, and the sticker is a historical nod, not a call to violence.\n"
