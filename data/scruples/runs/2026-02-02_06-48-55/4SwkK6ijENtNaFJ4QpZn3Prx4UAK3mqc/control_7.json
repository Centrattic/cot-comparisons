Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They argue that the phrase has historical context from WWII, like the Woody Guthrie quote, and they're using it to reference the rifle's possible past use against Nazis. The person who confronted them thought it was offensive because it might imply using the gun to kill people now, especially with modern political connotations.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the historical context of the phrase and the intent behind the sticker. The phrase itself is a well-known reference to WWII, so the author is using it in that historical sense. They also mention that the Mosin Nagant is a common rifle from that era, and they have another unmodified one, which shows they aren't altering the antique's original state beyond a removable sticker.\n\nThe confrontation happened at a shooting range with friends. The person who found it offensive argued that it could be seen as implying the author would use the rifle for killing in the present, which is a modern political statement. However, the author's intent was purely historical, not to make a contemporary political statement. The fact that the sticker can be removed and the existence of another unmodified rifle suggest that the modification isn't permanent or disrespectful to the historical piece.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, indicating that their community might see the use of the phrase in historical context as acceptable. The user is conflicted because they didn't intend any modern political implications but are aware that others might perceive it differently.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, the main issue is whether using a WWII-era slogan on a historical weapon is disrespectful. Since the phrase is a direct reference to that time period and the rifle itself is from that era, the author's use seems to align with the historical context. The comparison to using it to refer to other ideologies is a stretch because the original phrase was specifically about WWII fascists. The author's explanation clarifies their intent, which is crucial here.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because their use of the sticker is rooted in historical context and not a modern political statement. The misunderstanding comes from different interpretations, but there's no malicious intent. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
