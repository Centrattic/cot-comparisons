Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The person explains that the rifle is a WWII-era gun from Russia, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing the historical context. The issue came up when someone found it offensive, arguing that it implies the person would use it to kill others, similar to modern extremist slogans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original quote's context. The phrase \"This machine kills fascists\" was used during WWII by Woody Guthrie on his guitar. It was a protest against fascism during the war. The user is using it in reference to the rifle's history, suggesting it might have been used against Nazis. They also mention that the rifle is modified with a removable sticker, and they have another unmodified one. Their friends supported them, but they're now doubting if they were wrong.\n\nThe main arguments against them are that the sticker could be misinterpreted as supporting current political uses or implying they'd use the gun to kill people now. The user argues it's about historical context, not modern politics. \n\nI should consider whether using a historical war slogan on a historical weapon is offensive. Since the quote is from the same era as the rifle, and the user emphasizes the historical aspect, maybe it's not inherently offensive. However, some might find it insensitive if they associate the phrase with modern fascist movements, even if that's not the intent. \n\nThe person who criticized it made a comparison to modern groups, which the user found unfair. The user's defense is about historical accuracy and the phrase's origins. Since the sticker is removable and the gun is used for shooting paper targets, it's not being used as a threat. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of public perception. Even if the user's intention is historical, others might not see it that way. The question is whether intent matters more than how it's received. In terms of right or wrong, if the user didn't have malicious intent and is using a historical reference appropriately, they might not be wrong. However, if someone else is offended, does that make the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions are based on historical context and they didn't intend to offend. The person who was offended interpreted it in a different light. Since the user took care to explain the historical reference and the sticker is temporary, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
