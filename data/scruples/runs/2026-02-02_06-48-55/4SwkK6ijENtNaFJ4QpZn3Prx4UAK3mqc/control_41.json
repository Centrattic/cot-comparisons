Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They mentioned that the gun is historical, from WWII, and they use it for target practice. The friends had a discussion where someone found the sticker offensive, comparing it to using the phrase for other groups. The author argues the phrase is historical, from WWII, and not meant for modern political contexts.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" originated during WWII, associated with Billie Holiday's song and the mural by Diego Rivera. The user is using it on a historical gun, referencing its possible past use in WWII. The key here is whether the use is offensive or insensitive now.\n\nThe concern raised by the other person is that the sticker might imply the author would use the gun to kill people today, especially if the phrase is misinterpreted in a modern context. But the author clarifies that they intended it historically, not as a modern political statement. They also mention the gun is unmodified except for the sticker, which can be removed easily.\n\nNow, considering freedom of expression, people can display certain historical phrases, especially if they're using them in a historical context. However, the line between historical reference and potentially offensive content can be blurry. The author's friends supported them, suggesting that the context was clear. The other person's objection might stem from a different interpretation, but the author's intent was not to be offensive towards any current group.\n\nThe phrase's original context is important here. Since it's tied to WWII and not modern ideologies, and the gun is part of historical collection practices, it's plausible the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a nuance\u2014could the sticker be seen as trivializing the historical context or promoting violence? The author argues that the phrase is used as a historical reference and the gun isn't used for anything other than shooting at targets. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they used a historical phrase in a historical context, and their intent was educational. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists, which is why they might feel it's a bit trashy. But since the author's intention was respectful and historical, and the sticker is removable, they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
