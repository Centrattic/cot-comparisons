Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a historical rifle from WWII made in Tula. The sticker references a WWII-era slogan used by Pete Seeger for the song \"This Machine Kills Fascists,\" which was associated with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the fight against Nazis. The author uses the sticker as a historical nod, not a modern political statement. They mention that it's a joke and that the rifle is used for shooting at a range, not for actual combat.\n\nThe main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive. Critics might argue that using the phrase on a gun today could trivialize the historical context or imply support for current political stances against certain groups. However, the author clarifies that their intent is historical, not political. They also note that the rifle is part of their collection of historical firearms and that the sticker is removable without damage.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker suggested it could be seen as implying the author would use the gun against modern groups, which the author disputes. The author's friends support them, and the comparison to modern uses of similar phrases might not hold because the original context is well-documented as WWII-related.\n\nFactors to consider: intent, historical accuracy, and whether the sticker could be misinterpreted. The author's primary use is recreational shooting and historical appreciation, not promoting violence or modern ideology. The sticker is a historical reference, but some might still find it offensive if they perceive it as endorsing the use of violence against any group today.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intend any modern political message and the sticker is tied to a specific historical event. The key here is that the author made it clear that the reference is to WWII and not current issues. Since the author's purpose is historical and recreational, and there's no evidence they intended offense, it's more about differing opinions on historical references.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the sticker is seen as a historical joke without modern implications, then they're not in the wrong. But if the sticker's historical reference is misinterpreted or takes on a new meaning, others might find it offensive. However, the author's explanation and context suggest they are not in the wrong.\n"
