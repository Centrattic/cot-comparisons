Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical gun. The author explains that the gun is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Tula, and the sticker is a historical reference to the original WWII context. The argument is that the sticker could be seen as offensive because it might imply support for using the gun to kill people today, even though the author's intention is purely historical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original phrase was used during WWII, as mentioned. The author is using it on a historical gun, not a modern one. They also note that the gun is from the same era and that they have another unmodified one. The sticker is removable, so there's no permanent alteration. The person who criticized it argued that it could be offensive in the modern context, implying that the author might support using the gun against modern groups. The author's friends supported them, but they're unsure because they didn't mean to reference modern politics.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent versus perception. The author's intent is historical, but the perception of others might be different. The phrase \"kills fascists\" is specific to WWII, but in today's political climate, \"fascists\" can refer to various groups. If someone interprets the sticker as endorsing violence against modern groups, that could be seen as offensive. However, the author didn't intend that. But intent doesn't always override how others feel, especially in public spaces.\n\nThe author's defense is that the phrase is historical, and the gun is from the same era. However, the sticker is on a modern object (a gun they own) and being used in a contemporary setting. Even if the original quote is from WWII, using it on a gun today might still be seen as insensitive because it could be interpreted as supporting violence. The author's friends agree with their perspective, but others might not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering that their historical reference could be misinterpreted or offensive in the current context.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using historical references can sometimes clash with modern sensitivities. Even if the author's intent is purely academic or historical, the sticker is on a firearm, which is a tool that can be used for violence. The phrase's association with WWII might not negate the potential for modern interpretations. The author might be in the wrong if they are disregarding how others could take it, regardless of their intent. However, if the majority of people see it as a historical reference, maybe not. But the person who confronted them did take offense, and the author themselves are unsure.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action is considered insensitive despite their intent. If the action can be reasonably seen as offensive by others, then they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the context is clearly historical and the sticker is just a nod to the past, maybe not. The fact that the author feels conflicted suggests they recognize that their action could be problematic. The key is balancing personal expression with others' feelings. Since the author is using a historical phrase on a historical object, maybe it's not the wrong, but there's a valid argument either way. However, given that the sticker is placed on a gun (a weapon) and the phrase is about killing, even historically, it could be seen as insensitive. So leaning towards A (yes, in the wrong) because the potential for misinterpretation exists, and the author should consider that even if their intent is good.\n"
