Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a historical interest and collects guns, particularly older ones. They put the sticker on a Mosin Nagant made during WWII, which was a Soviet rifle used against the Nazis. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was originally from Woody Guthrie, referencing WWII. The author uses it in the historical context, not the modern political one. However, someone at the range found it offensive and claimed it implies the author would use it to kill people now, similar to modern political groups. The author argues that the phrase is historical and the gun is just for shooting paper targets, not people.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive. The user's friend thinks it's offensive because it could be misinterpreted as supporting violence against modern groups labeled as fascists. The author defends it by saying it's a historical reference and that the gun is just for shooting at targets, not people.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's intention is clearly historical, and the phrase has a well-known origin from WWII. However, in today's climate, \"fascist\" is sometimes used metaphorically or as a political slur. The sticker might be misinterpreted by some people who don't know its historical context. The author might not intend to be offensive, but the sticker could still be seen as insensitive by others who associate it with modern political statements.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the gun itself. The Mosin Nagant was used in WWII, so the connection to the original phrase is valid. The author also mentions having another unmodified version, so this isn't altering the historical artifact in a harmful way. The sticker is removable and doesn't damage the gun.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is wrong for using a historical reference that could be misinterpreted. The author isn't using it to promote violence against groups today, but the sticker's phrasing is similar to modern uses. The friends agreed with the author, but others might take offense. It's a matter of perspective. The author isn't in the wrong because the intent is historical and educational, and they explained their reasoning. The person who found it offensive had a different interpretation, but that doesn't necessarily make the author at fault. However, the author might be seen as insensitive if they didn't consider the modern connotations, even if that wasn't their intention.\n\nBut the author's main point is about historical context, and they clarified that the gun is for shooting paper. The comparison to modern uses is a stretch. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the misuse isn't intentional, and the context is historical. However, the author could consider removing the sticker if it's causing offense, but they aren't inherently wrong.\n"
