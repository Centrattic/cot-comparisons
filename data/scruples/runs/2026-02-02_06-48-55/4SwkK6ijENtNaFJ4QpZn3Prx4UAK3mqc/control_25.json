Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a gun enthusiast with a love for history. The Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era Russian rifle, and the sticker references a famous WWII slogan. The person put the sticker jokingly, acknowledging the rifle's possible historical role in fighting fascism. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe conflict arises when someone at the shooting range finds the sticker offensive, arguing it implies the author would use the gun to kill people today, similar to modern political statements. The author disagrees, emphasizing the historical context of both the rifle and the slogan.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are intent and context. The author's intention was historical, referencing WWII. The slogan was coined during that time by Pete Seeger. The sticker is on a historical artifact, not a modern weapon. The person who criticized it made a comparison to modern uses, but the author didn't intend it that way.\n\nHowever, others might argue that using such a phrase on a gun, even historically, could be seen as insensitive because it's associated with current political rhetoric. But the author clarifies they never meant it to refer to the modern political climate.\n\nConsidering that the author is respectful of the gun's history, uses it for recreational shooting, and the sticker is temporary, it seems like their actions are within their rights. The friends also supported them. The criticism might stem from a misunderstanding of the historical reference. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their historical interest in a non-offensive manner.\n"
