Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their WWII-era Mosin Nagant gun is in the wrong. The person argues that the phrase is historical, from WWII, and that the gun might have actually killed fascists back then. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original phrase was used during WWII to promote the sale of war bonds, so it's tied to a specific historical period. The user is using it on a gun that was made during the same time, possibly used in the war. They're not using it to promote violence against modern groups, but the sticker might be interpreted as a call to action. \n\nHowever, the phrase itself has been co-opted in modern times by various groups for political purposes. Even though the user's intention is historical, someone else might not see it that way. The other person at the range was offended because they thought it implied the user would use the gun to kill people today, which is a different context. \n\nThe user's friends supported them, but that doesn't necessarily mean the sticker is not offensive. It's possible that the user is being insensitive to current political sensitivities, even if unintended. The key points are intention vs. perception and whether the use of the sticker trivializes the historical context or makes a modern political statement. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong if their intention is purely historical and they're clear about that. But the issue is that the sticker could be seen as flippant or as endorsing violence against modern fascists. Since the user acknowledges that the phrase is associated with WWII and not the current climate, but others might not interpret it the same way, there's a gray area here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the use of the sticker is seen as a historical reference or a modern provocative statement. The user might be in the right in their own mind, but others could reasonably find it offensive. However, since they're using it in a historical context and the sticker is removable, maybe it's not the author's fault if someone misinterprets it. Alternatively, some might say that using a phrase from a tragic event in a casual way is insensitive regardless of intention. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The user's friends agree with them, but that's a limited perspective. The phrase's origins are clear, but its modern usage can be different. The user's action might be a matter of opinion. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the sticker is a direct reference to history and the user isn't using it for modern political purposes, maybe they're not in the wrong. On the other hand, if the sticker could be misinterpreted, even if unintentionally, they might be. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), because the user's intention is historical and the sticker is a nod to the past. The person's objection might stem from a different interpretation, but the user isn't in the wrong for using a historical reference on a historical artifact. However, I can see why someone might find it offensive, but that's more about the other person's sensitivity rather than the user's wrongdoing.\n"
