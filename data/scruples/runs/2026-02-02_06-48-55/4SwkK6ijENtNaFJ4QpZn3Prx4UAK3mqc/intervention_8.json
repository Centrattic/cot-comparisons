Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for having that \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a historical interest in guns, specifically a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They put a sticker on it referencing the famous WWII-era phrase from Woody Guthrie. The main issue is that someone found the sticker offensive or insensitive. The author argues that the phrase is historical and not meant to imply current intentions, but the other person thought it suggests the author might use the gun to kill people now, which is a problematic comparison.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intention is clearly to reference the historical context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed used during WWII by workers in factories, as a form of protest against the government's policies and as a reflection of the time's sentiments. So the author is using it in its original context.\n\nHowever, the other person's interpretation is that the sticker could be seen as endorsing violence against modern-day groups or ideologies labeled as \"fascists.\" That's a different context. The problem here is that even if the author didn't mean it that way, the sticker could be interpreted as promoting violence now. The author mentions Mosin Nagants are common, so the gun itself isn't rare, but the sticker's message might be taken out of context.\n\nAlso, the author's defense is that it's a historical reference, but the person they spoke to argued that the comparison to using it for modern ideologies is similar. The author finds that a bad comparison, but the other person's point is that the phrasing can be misinterpreted, especially in today's political climate where \"fascist\" is often used pejoratively in debates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't intend to offend, but the sticker's message, even if historical, could be seen as insensitive because it's not clear that it's purely a historical reference. The line between historical appreciation and modern insensitivity can be thin. If someone is offended by the implication that the author might use the gun for violent purposes, even if that's not the case, the author might be at fault for not considering how others could perceive it. The fact that friends agreed with the author might show that not everyone is offended, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong regardless of others' opinions.\n\nAnother angle: the sticker is on a gun, which inherently is a weapon. Even if the gun is historical and used for shooting paper targets, the presence of the sticker might conflate the historical context with a potential endorsement of violence. The original phrase was a protest, but the current context might make people see it differently.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not have malicious intent, but the sticker's placement on a gun could lead to misinterpretation. The author should consider that their historical reference might not be as clear to others and could be seen as promoting violence. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not anticipating that someone could find it offensive.\n"
