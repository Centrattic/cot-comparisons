Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The rifle is a WWII-era weapon from Russia, and the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was actually a real slogan from that time, associated with the Soviet Union's fight against Nazis. The user mentions they have historical interest and that the sticker is a nod to that history. They also clarify that they don't use it for modern political references and that the sticker is removable. \n\nNow, the criticism comes from someone who finds it offensive because it might imply the user would use the gun to kill people today, comparing it to more modern, potentially inflammatory slogans. The user argues that the phrase is historical and not meant for the current political climate. \n\nI need to assess if the user's action is inappropriate. The key points are intent and context. The user's intent is historical appreciation, not to make a modern political statement. The phrase itself has historical roots, so using it in that context isn't inherently wrong. The person who criticized it made a comparison to modern uses, but the user isn't using it that way. Also, the sticker is on a historical replica used for shooting ranges, not for actual harm. \n\nHowever, some might still find the phrase jarring regardless of intent. But since the user's explanation aligns with the original historical context and there's no evidence they're using it to promote violence or modern ideology, the answer likely leans towards them not being in the wrong. The fact that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version of the same rifle also shows they're respectful of the original's historical value. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
