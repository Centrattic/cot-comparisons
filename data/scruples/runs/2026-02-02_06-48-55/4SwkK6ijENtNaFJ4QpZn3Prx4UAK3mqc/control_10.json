Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main points to consider here are the intent behind the sticker, the historical context of the phrase, and the potential for misunderstanding or offense.\n\nFirst, the user's intent was historical, referencing the rifle's possible use in WWII. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference too, from Woody Guthrie, intended as propaganda to motivate people during the war. The user didn't mean the sticker to relate to modern politics but rather to acknowledge the weapon's historical role.\n\nHowever, when someone pointed out the sticker as insensitive, the user had to defend their choice. The person arguing against it made a comparison to modern ideologies, suggesting the sticker could imply a willingness to kill people with it now. The user's friends supported them, but they're left wondering if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context, the user isn't using the gun for violent purposes but for shooting at a range and historical appreciation. The sticker can be removed easily, and the user has another unmodified gun. The phrase itself, while historically rooted, can be seen as problematic today because of its association with violence and the modern term \"fascist\" being used in political debates. Even if the user's intent is historical, the sticker might still be misunderstood by others. \n\nBut the user's argument is that the phrase is historical, not a modern political statement. The key here is whether the user's actions were inconsiderate. They didn't intend to offend, and the sticker is removable. However, in a sensitive context like firearms, even historical references can be seen as provocative because of the current climate. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they had good intentions and the sticker is historical, but it's on a weapon, which inherently has violent connotations. The potential for misunderstanding exists, but if the user made it clear it's a historical reference and there's no harm caused, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But given that the sticker is on a gun, even for historical reasons, some might find it offensive regardless of intent. \n\nI think the answer hinges on balancing intent vs. impact. If the impact causes offense, even unintentionally, does that make the person in the wrong? In this case, the user's friends supported them, and they were in a shooting range community where such historical references are likely more accepted. The person who took issue might be from a different perspective. Since the user's friends sided with them and the context is historical, the author is probably not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
