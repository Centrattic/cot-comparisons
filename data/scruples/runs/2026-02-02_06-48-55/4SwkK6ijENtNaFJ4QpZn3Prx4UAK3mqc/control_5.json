Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Mosin Nagant is a historical WWII-era gun. The sticker's phrase was originally used during WWII, so there's a historical reference here. The user mentions they have another unmodified version of the same rifle, so the modification here is just a sticker that can be removed easily.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it's insensitive and implies the user might use the gun to kill people today. The user counters that the phrase is from WWII, not a modern political statement, and that the gun is now just for target practice. \n\nNow, considering the user's intent: they were using the historical context of both the rifle and the slogan. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Earl Browne during WWII, associated with the song \"This Is My Country.\" So the user is referencing a historical time when the rifle was used against Nazis. They don't mean to imply any modern violence, which is a key point.\n\nThe critic made a comparison to modern ideologies, which the user found unfair. The user's friends supported them. The question is whether the user is insensitively using the sticker. \n\nGiven that the sticker is a historical reference, not a modern one, and the gun is used for shooting paper targets, the user's intent seems to be about history, not current political statements. The sticker is removable, and there's no permanent alteration to the gun. \n\nHowever, some people might still find it offensive because it could be seen as trivializing the death toll of WWII or using a historical weapon in a way that's insensitive to those who suffered. But if the user's intention is purely historical and they aren't promoting current violence, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nThe user might be in a gray area. But since the phrase is a direct quote from a time when it was appropriate, and the gun's use is non-lethal now, it's more about historical appreciation. Unless the user is using it to attack modern groups, they aren't wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
