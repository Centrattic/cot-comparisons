Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. The Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era rifle from Russia. The sticker they put on it is a reference to a WWII-era slogan, originally from Woody Guthrie. The author's reasoning is that the rifle might have been used against fascists in the past, and now it's just for shooting targets. \n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies the author uses the rifle to kill people today, especially when the phrase is used in modern contexts. The author disagrees, noting the historical context and the original intent of the slogan. Friends support the author, but they're unsure.\n\nNow, considering the nuances. The original phrase is a historical reference, which the author is using in that context. The main issue is whether using it on a gun today is insensitive. The author clarifies they don't mean the modern political use but refer to WWII. However, the sticker might not make that distinction clear to others. The person who objected might be conflating the historical phrase with current uses of similar phrases, which are often used in political propaganda. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Factors include intent, context, and how others perceive it. The author's intent is historical and respectful, but others might not see the distinction and could find it offensive, especially when associated with a functional gun. The author's defense is valid in historical terms, but the potential for misinterpretation exists. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether intent alone absolves the action. If the author's use is purely historical and not meant to imply any current political stance or threat, and they're not using it in a way that's derogatory, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the sticker's placement on a weapon, even for sport, could be seen as insensitive regardless of intent, then maybe they are. The community's perspective is split here. The key is the balance between historical appreciation and modern sensitivities.\n"
