Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The context is that the rifle was made in WWII, and the person uses it for shooting at the range. The friend found the sticker offensive, arguing it could imply using the gun to kill people now, while the author thinks it's a historical reference to WWII.\n\nFirst, I need to assess intent. The author's intention was clearly historical, referencing the original WWII context of the quote. The quote itself is from Pete Seeger, associated with WWII efforts. The person isn't using it in a modern political context but rather acknowledging the rifle's possible past use. The sticker is removable and on a replica or historical piece, not a modern weapon. \n\nNext, the friend's concern is about how the sticker might be interpreted today. They argue it's similar to using the phrase for modern groups, which could be offensive. However, the author's context is different because the rifle is historical, and the usage is for shooting paper targets, not people. The author's friends supported them, so there's some social validation there.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key factors are intent versus perception. The author had no malicious intent, and the use is within a hobbyist, historical context. The sticker is a nod to history, not a call to violence. However, the friend's sensitivity is valid in that symbols can have multiple interpretations. But given the circumstances\u2014non-threatening use, historical accuracy, and no evidence of targeting modern groups\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
