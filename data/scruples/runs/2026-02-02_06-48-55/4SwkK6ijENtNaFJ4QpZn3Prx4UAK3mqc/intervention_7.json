Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical gun. First, I need to understand the context. The individual has a Mosin Nagant from WWII, which was used by the Soviets. The sticker is a reference to a WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger. The person argues it's about the historical context of the gun's use against Nazis, not a modern political statement. \n\nNow, the person who confronted them said it's offensive and implies they'd use it to kill others now. The user's friends support them, but they're questioning if they're wrong. The key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intention is historical, but the sticker could be misinterpreted by others as promoting violence today.\n\nI should consider that the original quote is from a specific historical period and has a clear meaning in that context. However, attaching it to a modern gun might confuse people, especially those unaware of the history. The author uses the sticker on a historical replica, but others might not know the backstory and see it as endorsing violence against current ideologies.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. That shows consideration for the gun's historical value. But the issue is the potential offense caused. The person who confronted them is in a minority, but if the sticker makes others uncomfortable, even if unintended, there's a case for sensitivity.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intent is historical, not to promote modern violence. On the other hand, the sticker's message might be seen as insensitive by those who don't understand the context. The debate here is between personal expression and public perception. Since the author is part of a group with friends who support them, but others might still find it offensive, it's a gray area. However, the author's explanation is reasonable, and the sticker is a historical reference. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong, but it's not black and white. I think the answer is B (No).\n"
