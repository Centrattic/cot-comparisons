Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The situation involves a discussion with friends and someone else at the shooting range who found the sticker offensive. The author's defense is that the phrase has historical context from WWII and that the rifle itself might have been used in that war. They argue it's not about modern politics but the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The person who confronted the author felt it's offensive because it could imply the author would use the rifle to kill others now, even though the author's intention is purely historical. The author points out the phrase's origin and the historical context of the rifle. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author didn't mean to reference modern politics, but others might perceive it differently. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed from WWII, associated with the song \"My Land is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie. However, using it on a gun today could be seen as insensitive if someone interprets it as endorsing violence against modern groups labeled as \"fascists,\" regardless of the author's intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a historical gun and the sticker is removable might mitigate some concerns. But the issue is that the sticker could be triggering or offensive to others who associate the phrase with current political tensions. The author's friends supported them, but the person who confronted them made a valid point about how the sticker might imply a willingness to use the gun for violence now. \n\nThe author's explanation about the historical context is valid, but so is the other person's concern about how it's perceived. The line between historical appreciation and insensitivity can be thin. Since the author is inviting others to understand the historical reference, but others might not share that context and take offense, there's a case that the author didn't consider the potential impact beyond their own understanding.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a respectful intent. However, they could be seen as not considering the broader implications of their choice in a modern context where the term \"fascist\" is often used in political discourse. Therefore, while not malicious, the action could be considered insensitive if it offends others, even if unintentionally. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where they could have been more mindful of others' perspectives.\n"
