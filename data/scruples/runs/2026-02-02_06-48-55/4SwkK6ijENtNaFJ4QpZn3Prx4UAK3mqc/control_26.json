Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is into historical guns, owns a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Russia, and put a sticker that's a reference to a WWII-era slogan. They mention that the original phrase was coined during WWII by the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" so it has historical significance. The person argues that the sticker is a nod to the rifle's possible past use against Nazis and not meant to imply anything about modern politics.\n\nThe issue comes up when someone at the shooting range finds the sticker offensive or insensitive. The person argues that the sticker is historical and not meant to be taken as a modern statement. They also note that the rifle is modified with a removable sticker, and they have an unmodified version too. Their friends support them, but they're still doubting if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: historical reference vs. modern interpretation, intent vs. perception, and the sensitivity around using historical slogans in the present. The person didn't intend to make a modern political statement, but others might perceive it that way. The key is whether the intent matters or if the sticker's potential to be offensive makes the person at fault regardless of their intent.\n\nThe original slogan was used during WWII in a specific context. Using it on a historical gun might be seen as honoring that context. However, the phrase \"kills fascists\" could be co-opted in modern times for different ideologies, which might be why the person at the range was concerned. The person argues that their usage is historical, but others might see it as trivializing the original intent or possibly promoting violence under the guise of history.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the sticker is used in good faith to reference history and not to endorse violence or modern ideology, then maybe not. But if it's offensive to others, even unintentionally, some might argue they should consider removing it. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the person's intent was historical and the sticker is removable and not permanent, and considering that the phrase has historical roots, the answer might lean towards them not being at fault. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The friends sided with them, but the other person felt it was offensive. It's a judgment call between intent and perception. Since the original phrase is a historical reference and the author's usage aligns with that, they might not be in the wrong. But others might still find it offensive. The answer likely depends on whether intent is considered valid or if the potential for offense makes them at fault. In this case, since the author's intent is clear and the context is historical, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
