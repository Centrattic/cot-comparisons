Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their old Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the history of the gun, and the reaction from others.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Woody Guthrie during WWII, so it's rooted in a specific historical context. The user is using it on a rifle that was made during the same time period, possibly even used in WWII. They argue that the sticker is a nod to that history, not a modern political statement. The user explains that the guns are for shooting at the range, not for killing people now, and that the sticker is just a joke or a historical reference.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought it was offensive because it might imply they'd use the gun to kill people today with that ideology. The user points out that the original phrase was about WWII and that the gun's history fits that context. Their friends support them, but they're still unsure.\n\nNow, considering free speech and historical context, the user isn't using the sticker in a way that directly promotes violence or hate in the modern sense. They're referencing a historical quote in a historical item. The sticker can be removed easily, and they have another unmodified gun. The other person's concern might stem from a misunderstanding or a different interpretation of the phrase in today's political climate. However, the user didn't intend it that way, and there's no evidence they're using it to target people now. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. They're using a historical reference on a historical object in a non-threatening, recreational context. The issue is more about differing interpretations. The answer is B.\n"
