Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They argue that the phrase is historical, referencing WWII and the rifle's possible role then. The person put the sticker as a joke or historical reference, and someone else found it offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a real thing from WWII, used by the US Army. So the author is using a historical reference on a historical gun. They mention that the rifle was made during WWII in Tula, which is a Russian factory. So the connection to WWII history is there.\n\nThe author says the sticker can be removed easily and they have another unmodified version. They also mention that the phrase was coined by Woody Guthrie, known for \"This Land is Your Land,\" which adds credibility to the historical aspect. So they're not trying to make a modern political statement but rather reference the past.\n\nHowever, the person they talked to at the range found it offensive, suggesting it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, especially with the modern political connotations. The author argues that the sticker isn't meant to refer to current issues but the historical context. Their friends supported them, but they're still unsure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent vs. perception. The author's intent was historical, but the sticker could be misinterpreted in today's context. The person who found it offensive saw a potential link to modern ideologies, which the author didn't intend. \n\nIn such cases, even if the intent is clear, the effect on others matters. The phrase might be triggering for some, especially with the current rise in political tensions. However, the author wasn't making a political statement but rather a historical nod. The phrase itself is a well-known historical reference, so maybe the criticism is unfounded. \n\nBut some might argue that using a phrase with such a strong historical and political context on a weapon, even a historical one, could be seen as trivializing the violence of war or using historical atrocities for personal hobby. Others might say that as long as it's a respectful and accurate reference to history without promoting modern hate, it's acceptable.\n\nThe author isn't using the sticker to endorse violence against a modern group explicitly. They're referencing a past conflict where the phrase was used. However, the line between historical reference and modern insensitivity can be thin. If the author's friends support them, that's a point for B (not in the wrong). But if the sticker could reasonably be seen as insensitive, even unintentionally, that tips towards A.\n\nBut considering that the author's intent was purely historical and the phrase is a documented part of history, it's more about the other person's interpretation. The author didn't intend to offend, so they might not be in the wrong. However, there's a valid argument that in today's climate, even historical references can be misinterpreted. The author should consider removing the sticker if it causes discomfort, but whether they're in the wrong is debatable.\n\nGiven that the author is using a historical reference accurately and the sticker is removable, it's more about differing opinions. The person who found it offensive might be overreacting, especially since the author isn't promoting current violence. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
