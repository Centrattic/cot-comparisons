Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle. The author explains they put it there as a historical reference, given the gun's possible role in WWII. They mention that the phrase comes from a WWII context, and they don't mean it to apply to modern politics.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought it's offensive because it might imply the author would use it to kill people now, which the author disagrees with. The friends sided with the author, but they're questioning if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical, referencing the original WWII context. However, the sticker could be seen as insensitive if others interpret it as endorsing violence against groups labeled as \"fascists\" in the modern context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a famous quote from the 1940s, but today, the term \"fascist\" is often used more broadly and can be politically charged.\n\nEven if the author's intention is purely historical, the sticker's placement on a functioning gun might lead others to perceive it as a threat or a glorification of violence. The author argues that it's a historical reference, but symbols can carry different meanings depending on the viewer's perspective. The fact that the person who confronted them made the comparison to using the gun against other groups suggests that the sticker's message might be ambiguous or open to misinterpretation.\n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges that others might find it trashy, even if they disagree. The friends support them, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is entirely in the right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering both intent and potential impact. Since the sticker could be offensive to some, even if unintended, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how others could perceive it. However, if the author's intent is clear and historical, that could shift the perspective.\n\nBut in public contexts, especially with firearms, symbols that reference violence need careful consideration. The author might be in the wrong because the sticker, while historically accurate, could be seen as insensitive regardless of intent. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because intent doesn't always override how others are affected.\n"
