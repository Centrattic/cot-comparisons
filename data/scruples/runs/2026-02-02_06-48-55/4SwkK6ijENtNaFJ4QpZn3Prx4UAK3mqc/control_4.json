Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context, intent, and the reaction they received.\n\nFirst, the person is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. They have a WWII-era Russian rifle and added a historical sticker that was originally from WWII, coined by someone like Woody Guthrie. The sticker is on a personal item, a gun they use for shooting at a range, not for actual combat. They mention it's a removable sticker and they have another identical gun without it. \n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies using the gun to kill people in the modern context, which could be seen as offensive. The original poster countered that the quote has a historical reference to WWII and isn't meant to refer to current politics. Their friends supported them, but they're unsure now.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical quote from the 1940s, associated with WWII. The user's intention was to reference the historical context of the rifle's use. However, the sticker's placement on a gun, even if for hobby use, might be seen as insensitive by some. Guns can be associated with violence, so even if the intent is historical, others might misinterpret it as endorsing violence against certain groups today. \n\nBut considering the user didn't intend to refer to modern politics, and the context is a historical discussion, the action might be seen as a personal choice. The key is whether the intent aligns with how others perceive it. Since the user's friends agreed with them and the context is a shooting range among enthusiasts, maybe it's acceptable. However, the person who was offended felt it was implying a modern threat, which could be a valid concern in public spaces. \n\nThe author isn't directly targeting anyone, and the sticker is part of historical appreciation. The answer hinges on intent versus perception. If the author's intent was purely historical and not to offend, and the context is among like-minded individuals, then they're probably not in the wrong. But if the sticker could be reasonably perceived as promoting violence in the present, that's a gray area. However, given the historical context and the user's explanation, it's more about personal expression rather than malicious intent. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
