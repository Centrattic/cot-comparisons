Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a historical gun from WWII. They put a sticker on it referencing a quote from that era, which was originally used by Pete Seeger. The context is that the gun might have been used in WWII, so the sticker is a nod to its possible past. The author explains they didn't mean it in a modern political sense but rather as a historical reference. However, someone found it offensive, arguing it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, similar to using it for other ideologies. The author's friends supported them, but they're unsure if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's intention was historical and not to support violence now. The sticker is removable and on a replica, not an original. The original quote is from WWII, same time as the gun. The other person's concern is that the sticker could be seen as promoting violence or linking current politics to the gun. The author didn't intend that, but intentions don't always override perceptions.\n\nIs it wrong? If someone interprets it as offensive, even if unintended, the author might be at fault for not considering how others could perceive it in today's context. But the author's friends agreed it's historical. It's a balance between personal expression and public sensitivity. The quote's original meaning is tied to WWII, but using it on a gun now might still cause issues, especially with the political climate. The author could argue it's a historical nod, but others might not see that. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they should be aware of sensitivities. The answer seems like B (not in the wrong) because the context is historical and the author didn't intend modern offense. However, the other person's valid reaction is there. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering their intent and the context, the answer is B.\n"
