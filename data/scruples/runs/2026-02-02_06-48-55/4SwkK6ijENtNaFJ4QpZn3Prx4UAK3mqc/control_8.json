Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The question is whether that's appropriate or if they're being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined during WWII by Pete Seeger, right? And it's associated with the historical use of weapons against Nazis. The Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era Russian rifle, so the author is referencing its possible historical role in fighting fascists. They say they're not using it in a modern political sense but just acknowledging its past.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker could imply the author wants to use the gun to kill people now, even if it's a historical reference. The author counters that it's a historical reference and not about modern politics. Friends support the author, but they feel uncertain.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intention is historical, but others might interpret it differently. The phrase, while from WWII, can be sensitive when used today, especially with guns. Some people might see it as trivializing the past or being a provocative statement in current political debates about guns and violence.\n\nBut the author is using it on a historical context, and the gun is used for target practice, not actual harm. They emphasize that the sticker is easy to remove, and they have another unmodified gun. The original phrase was a protest against war, but the author is using it in a historical context. \n\nOn the other hand, the counterargument is that any use of such a phrase on a weapon, even with historical intent, could be seen as insensitive because it's associated with violence. People might not consider the historical angle and focus on the literal message. Also, the comparison to using the same phrasing for other ideologies might be valid if the sticker is seen as a call to action rather than a historical note.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the intent is purely historical and the sticker doesn't promote violence, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the sticker could be misinterpreted and cause offense, there's a case for being insensitive. However, since the author explains their reasoning and the context, and friends support them, maybe they aren't. Still, the person who confronted them has a valid point about potential misinterpretation. \n\nI think the balance here is that the author isn't in the wrong because their intent is historical and they're not promoting violence. However, they might be insensitive to others' perceptions. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the phrase has a historical context and the use is non-violent, the answer might be B (No).\n"
