Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the gun is a WWII-era Russian rifle and the sticker is a reference to the historical context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Woody Guthrie during WWII, so the author is using it in its original context. They mention that the gun is from the same period and might have been used in that era. The author also clarifies that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun for comparison.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker is offensive because it could imply the author wants to use it to kill people now, which the author disagrees with. The author's friends supported them, and they're conflicted.\n\nNow, considering the original intent of the phrase and the historical context, the author is using it in the way it was originally intended. The phrase is a historical reference, not a modern political statement. However, the person who confronted them might be interpreting it in a modern context, where \"fascists\" can refer to current ideologies. The problem here is the potential for different interpretations. Even if the author meant it historically, others might see it as a call to violence now.\n\nBut the author emphasizes that they didn't mean it in a modern political sense. They also state that the gun is used for target practice, not for actual harm. The key here is intent versus impact. While the author's intent is historical, the impact on others might still be seen as insensitive because the phrase can be weaponized today. \n\nHowever, the author is using a historical artifact in a historical context. The phrase is tied to its time, so the author's usage doesn't directly promote violence in the modern sense. Plus, the gun is not a modern weapon but a historical one. The fact that the sticker can be removed also suggests it's not a permanent modification, which might mitigate some concerns.\n\nIn public settings, like a shooting range, people have different sensitivities. The confrontation might have been a misunderstanding. The author isn't in the wrong because their use is rooted in historical context and they're not promoting current violence. The person who confronted them might be overstepping by applying modern political interpretations to a historical reference.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The usage is in line with the original intent of the phrase and the historical context of the gun. The author's explanation and the historical background support their position, even though others might find it insensitive. The key is the lack of intent to cause modern harm and the historical accuracy of the reference.\n"
