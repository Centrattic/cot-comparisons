Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a WWII-era Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains that the rifle is from WWII, made in Tula, and the sticker is a reference to its historical context. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same rifle. The conflict arose when someone found the sticker insensitive, arguing that it could be interpreted as implying the author would use the gun to kill people, especially with the modern political connotations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the original intent of the quote. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference from WWII, created by Woody Guthrie. The author is using it in the context of the rifle's history, which actually might have been used by Soviet forces against Nazis. So the author's intention seems to be historical homage rather than a modern statement.\n\nNext, the controversy. The person who objected felt it was offensive because it could be seen as implying the gun is for use against modern ideologies. The author argues that the phrase isn't new and the context is historical. The friends supported the author, but the author is questioning if it's trashy.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intent was historical, but others might perceive it as insensitive, especially in today's climate where \"fascists\" can refer to various groups. However, the original context is clear, and the author has a legitimate historical reason for the sticker. Also, the gun is an antique, not a modern weapon, which might mitigate some concerns.\n\nGun ownership and historical firearms are hobbies for the author, and the sticker is removable. The objection came from someone else's interpretation, but the author isn't using the gun for violent purposes. The comparison to modern uses might be a stretch. The author is not promoting violence but celebrating history.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a historical reference with a historical object, and the sticker doesn't promote current violence. The issue is more about differing interpretations rather than malicious intent. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
