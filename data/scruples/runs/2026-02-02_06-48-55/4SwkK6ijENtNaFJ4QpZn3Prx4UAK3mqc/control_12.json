Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about a sticker on a historical gun that says \"This Machine Kills Fascists.\" The person is into historical guns and uses them at the shooting range. They put the sticker on a Mosin Nagant from WWII. The sticker's phrase is from a WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger, right? The user put it there as a nod to the gun's possible historical role in WWII. But someone found it offensive, saying it implies the author would use it to kill people now, comparing it to similar stickers with other ideologies. The author argues it's about history, not modern times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference. The original context was during WWII, promoting the use of machinery (like tractors repurposed as tanks) against fascism. The author is using it on a rifle that was likely used in that war. So, is that appropriate? The author's intention is historical, not to make a modern political statement. But the problem is that the person who confronted them interpreted it differently, thinking it could suggest current intentions to kill others. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's use of the sticker is offensive or insensitive. The author is clear that they don't mean it in a modern political sense. However, others might not make that distinction. The phrase, even if historical, could be seen as trivializing violence or making a political statement, especially when attached to a functional weapon. But the author is using it in a historical context, and the gun is an antique. The sticker is removable, and they even have another unmodified version of the same gun. \n\nThe other person's argument is that the sticker could imply the author is willing to use the gun to kill people now, which is a stretch if the gun is for shooting paper targets. The author's friends supported them, so there's a divide in perception here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the sticker. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's intention is historical homage, but others might find it offensive regardless. However, since the author didn't intend to be offensive and the context is historical, and the sticker is easily removable, it's more about differing perspectives. The author isn't using it in a way that's promoting violence now. So, they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
