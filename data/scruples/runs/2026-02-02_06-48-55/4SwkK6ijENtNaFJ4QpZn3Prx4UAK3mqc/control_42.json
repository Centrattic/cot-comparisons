Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a sticker on a historical gun, specifically a Mosin Nagant from WWII. The sticker says \"This Machine Kills Fascists,\" which is a reference to a quote from the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a history enthusiast who collects historical firearms. They put the sticker on a gun they own, which they use at the shooting range. The sticker is a historical reference, not a modern political statement. The user mentions that the phrase was coined by the same person as \"My Land is Your Land,\" which is Woody Guthrie, and it's associated with WWII. The author argues that the sticker refers to the gun's potential use during the war, not implying they would use it to kill people now. They also note that the sticker can be removed easily and that they have another unmodified gun.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought the sticker was offensive because it might imply the author would use the gun to kill others now. The author disagrees, stating the phrase is historical. The friends supported the author. The question is whether the author is at fault for putting the sticker there.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. On one hand, the author is using a historical reference on a historical object, which might be seen as appropriate in a historical context. The phrase itself is from the past, tied to a specific era. The author's intention is to acknowledge the gun's history, not to make a modern political statement. The gun is used for recreational shooting, not for violent purposes now.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might find the sticker insensitive because the phrase \"kills fascists\" is associated with violence. Even if the author isn't using it for that purpose now, the sticker could be interpreted as endorsing violence against a group, especially if someone takes it out of context. The person who confronted them might feel that using such a phrase on a gun, regardless of historical context, could be seen as trivializing the seriousness of the original quote or suggesting current intent to commit violence.\n\nBut the key here is the author's intent versus the potential perception. The author didn't mean to refer to the modern political climate. However, others might not be aware of that intent. The phrase, when placed on a gun, could be misread. The author also acknowledges that the comparison to other ideologies or groups was made by the person who confronted him, but he felt that was an invalid comparison. The friends sided with him, suggesting that some people understand the historical context.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't using the gun for harm now, and the sticker is a historical nod. However, if someone is offended by it, does the author have a responsibility to consider that? It's a balance between personal expression and public perception. Since the sticker is on a personal item and not in a public space, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if it's in a public setting like a shooting range, others might encounter it and be affected. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they had a legitimate historical reason and didn't intend to offend. But at the same time, they should be aware that symbols can have different meanings to different people. However, given that the phrase is from the same era as the gun and the author explained the context, it's more of a misunderstanding. The answer likely depends on whether intent and context matter more than potential misinterpretation. Since the author's friends supported him and the sticker is removable, it's probably not their fault.\n"
