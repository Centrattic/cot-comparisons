Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, which is a historical WWII-era gun. They argue that the sticker is a reference to the rifle's historical context and the original quote from the 1940s. The person was told it's offensive because it could imply they want to use the gun to kill people now, especially with the modern political connotations of \"fascist.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the original quote. \"This machine kills fascists\" was a slogan used during WWII by Woody Guthrie for a folk band's truck, to highlight the anti-facist cause. The author uses it on their historical rifle, which might have been used in the war. But now, the term \"fascist\" has evolved in meaning and is often used in modern political discourse, which could be where the offense comes from.\n\nThe author says they put the sticker jokingly and meant it as a historical reference. They also mention that the gun is unmodified except for the sticker, which is removable. However, the person who confronted them argues that the sticker could be seen as implying the author would use the gun to kill people now, which is a different context. The author's friends supported them, but they're questioning if it's trashy.\n\nI need to weigh intent versus perception. The author's intent was historical, but others might perceive it as insensitive, especially given current events. Even if the author isn't referring to modern politics, the phrase can carry that connotation today. Also, having a gun with such a sticker, regardless of intent, might make others uncomfortable, associating it with violence. \n\nAnother angle is the nature of guns themselves. Even if the gun is historical, attaching a slogan that references killing could be seen as trivializing the weapon's purpose, even if it's from the past. Some might argue that using a weapon as a symbol, especially one that references killing, is inherently problematic regardless of historical context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is engaging in a hobby and referencing historical accuracy. They have another unmodified version of the same gun, so it's not altering the historical value. The sticker is removable, which suggests they aren't trying to permanently modify the antique. The original quote is tied to a historical struggle, which the gun might have been part of.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author's use of the phrase is offensive. The person who confronted them felt it was offensive, and even if the author didn't mean it that way, the effect matters. The author's friends supported them, but that doesn't negate the other person's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the intent or the potential offense is more important. If the author didn't intend to be offensive but the sticker can be perceived as such in modern times, there's a case that they are in the wrong for not considering how others might interpret it. Alternatively, if the phrase is a historical reference and not meant to be taken as a modern statement, then maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between historical context and modern sensitivities. Since the phrase can have dual meanings and the author is aware of the historical context, but others might not, and the person who felt offended is valid in their perception, the author might be in the wrong for not removing the sticker even if it's a historical reference. However, others might defend the historical use. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the person who confronted them thought so. So maybe AITA is a matter of perspective, but the author could be considered in the wrong for not foreseeing the possible modern interpretations and their impact.\n"
