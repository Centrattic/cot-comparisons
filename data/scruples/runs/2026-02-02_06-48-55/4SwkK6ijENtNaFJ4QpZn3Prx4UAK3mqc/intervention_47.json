Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their gun. The situation involves the author's hobby of historical guns and the context of the sticker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a Mosin Nagant from WWII and put the sticker as a joke, referencing the historical context. The sticker's phrase was coined in WWII, so they argue it's not a modern political statement. However, someone at the range found it offensive, implying it could suggest using the gun to kill people today. The author's friends supported them, but they're unsure.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both sides. The author's intent was historical and not to imply current violence. They mention the phrase's origin and the gun's history. However, the person who confronted them felt it's offensive because the sticker might be seen as a threat. The author argues it's a historical reference, but others might not make that connection.\n\nThe main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive. The author isn't targeting a specific group in the modern context, but the phrase could be misinterpreted. Even if the intent is historical, the presence of the sticker on a functional gun might lead some people to see it as a threat or a call to violence. The author's defense is that the gun is used for target practice and not for harming people, but the sticker's message might not be clear to everyone.\n\nAlso, considering the context of guns and the sensitivity around gun violence, even a historical reference might be seen as irresponsible. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was purely historical and the sticker is removable. However, the potential for misunderstanding exists, so maybe the author should consider the sticker's impact on others, even if unintended. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could depend on intent versus impact.\n\nIn the end, if the author's intent was not to be offensive and the sticker is a historical reference, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the sticker could be reasonably seen as offensive regardless of intent, then they might be. Since the user's friends sided with them, but others could find it offensive, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent was clear and it's a historical reference. However, some might argue that even with good intent, the sticker is insensitive because it could be misread. The answer likely depends on weighing intent vs. impact. Given that the phrase is from WWII and the context is historical, and the author clarifies it's not about current politics, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B."
