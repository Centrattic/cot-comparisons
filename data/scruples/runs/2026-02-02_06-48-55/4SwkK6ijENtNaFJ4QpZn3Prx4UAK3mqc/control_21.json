Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. Let's break down the context.\n\nFirst, the author has a hobby involving historical guns, which they use at the shooting range. The specific gun in question is a Mosin Nagant from WWII, and the sticker is a reference to a historical quote from the 1940s. The user mentions that the phrase \"This machine kills fascists\" was originally coined during WWII, associated with Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. The author argues that the sticker is a historical nod, not a modern political statement. \n\nThe person who found it offensive argued that the sticker implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, similar to other ideologies or groups. The author disagrees, pointing out that it's a historical context and that the gun is used for target practice, not actual violence. The author's friends support them, but they're still uncertain.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent vs. impact. The author's intention is clearly to reference historical context, not to make a modern political statement. The phrase has a specific origin tied to WWII resistance efforts. However, the other person interprets it as potentially offensive because it could be seen as trivializing the phrase's original intent by applying it to modern contexts or implying a readiness to kill people now. \n\nThe author emphasizes that the gun is used for historical appreciation and target shooting, not as a weapon for current conflicts. The Mosin Nagant is a common rifle, and the sticker is removable, so there's no permanent modification. The author also has an unmodified version of the same rifle, so the sticker isn't defacing an antique beyond easy removal.\n\nOn the other hand, the concern is that even if the intention is historical, the sticker might be misinterpreted. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" can be seen as a provocative statement, especially in today's polarized climate. Some might argue that using a weapon with such a sticker could be insensitive, given that real people died in WWII and using a weapon, even for recreational purposes, might trivialize that. However, the author is using it in a shooting range, which is a common hobby, so that context matters.\n\nThe debate also hinges on whether the phrase is being used in its original context or co-opted. Since the author is aware of the historical background and uses it as a nod to that era, it's a legitimate reference. The other person's comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies is a stretch because the original phrase is specifically tied to WWII. The author's argument that it's not a modern invention and is part of the same historical context is valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't forcing others to view the sticker or engage in the hobby. If someone finds it offensive, the author can explain the context, but it's not inherently insensitive if the intent is historical appreciation. The author isn't making a political statement, just referencing a historical quote. The friends agreeing with the author suggests that the community they're part of doesn't find it offensive.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument that even if the intent is historical, the visual of a weapon with that phrase can be jarring. But given that the gun is used for target practice and the author has explained their reasoning, it seems like a case of differing perspectives rather than wrongdoing.\n\nSo, weighing intent, context, and the explanation provided, the author is not in the wrong because their use is historical and non-offensive in that context. The answer should be B.\n"
