Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is at fault for being insensitive.\n\nFirst, the context: The rifle is from WWII, made in Tula, Russia. The sticker references a WWII-era slogan by Woody Guthrie. The person argues that the rifle might have actually been used against fascists back then, and now it's just for shooting paper targets. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought the sticker was offensive because it implied using the gun to kill people now, comparing it to using any other ideology. The user's friends supported them, but they're questioning if it's trashy.\n\nI need to consider the original intent vs. the possible modern interpretation. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference, but today, using it on a gun might be seen as trivializing the actual violence of the past or as a provocative statement depending on current political tensions. However, the user's explanation suggests they were using the historical context, not making a modern political statement. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's a historical gun and the sticker is removable might mitigate some of the offense. The user isn't modifying the gun's function but adding a historical reference. The person who confronted them might be conflating the historical slogan with a modern use, but the user's defense is that it's about the past.\n\nHowever, some people might still find it offensive because they associate the phrase with current events or see any use of such a slogan on a weapon as insensitive. But the user's intention was historical, not to imply any current violent intent. \n\nSo, is the user at fault? It's a judgment call. If the user's intent was purely historical and they made that clear, then maybe they aren't wrong. The person who confronted them might be overreaching by comparing it to modern ideologies. But the user might have considered that others could take it the wrong way, hence their hesitation.\n\nIn the end, since the user explained their reasoning and it's historical, they might not be in the wrong. Answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
