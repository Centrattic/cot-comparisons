Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue is whether this sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has a historical gun from WWII and uses it at a shooting range. They applied a sticker that's a reference to a WWII-era quote, which was originally a satirical response to the \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" song. The user argues that the sticker refers to the gun's historical use against Nazis, not modern implications. \n\nThe person who criticized the sticker claims it's offensive because it could imply the user wants to kill people today, similar to how some modern stickers are used. The user disagrees, saying the phrase is historical and not meant to be taken as a modern political statement. \n\nNow, considering the arguments. The user's intention is key here. They state they never meant it to refer to current politics and are aware of the historical context. They also mention that the gun is for historical enjoyment and target practice, not for violent purposes. The sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified gun, which shows they aren't altering the historical pieces permanently or disrespecting them.\n\nThe criticism comes from someone else's interpretation that the sticker could be seen as promoting violence. However, the user is using a historical reference appropriately, given the gun's origin. The phrase itself, while from a satirical source, is commonly used in historical contexts to refer to the WWII period.\n\nThe friends supported the user, and the user acknowledges the sticker's historical relevance. The key here is whether the user's intent and the historical context negate the potential for the sticker being seen as offensive. Since the user isn't making a modern political statement and the sticker is tied to the gun's historical use, it's more about appreciation of history rather than promoting violence.\n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
