Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era Russian rifle. They argue that the sticker is a reference to the historical context, since the rifle might have been used in WWII, and the phrase was coined by Pete Seeger during that time. But someone else found it offensive and compared it to modern political uses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. They mention they're into history and the sticker is a joke referencing the gun's possible past. They also clarify that it's not intended to reference current politics. But the main issue is whether the sticker could be seen as insensitive regardless of intent.\n\nThe person who complained said the sticker implies the author would use it to kill people, similar to how modern political groups might use such phrases. The author counters that the phrase is historical and the gun is for shooting paper, not people. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, even if their intention wasn't malicious.\n\nIn terms of sensitivity, symbols and phrases can have different meanings to different people. Even if the author's intent is historical, others might interpret it as endorsing violence against modern groups labeled as \"fascists.\" The phrase has been used in various contexts, including by modern activists, which could cause confusion or offense. The fact that the gun is historical might mitigate some of that, but it's still a symbol that can be weaponized in today's discourse.\n\nAlso, the author's friends sided with them, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're right. Social contexts vary, and what's acceptable in one group might not be in another. The key points are: the sticker's potential to be misinterpreted, the author's intent versus perception, and the sensitivity around using historical symbols in a modern context.\n\nI think the author might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was historical and not to promote modern violence. However, they might not have considered how others could perceive the sticker. It's a gray area. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B, I need to decide. The person who complained might be overreacting, but the author could have chosen a different sticker to avoid any misunderstanding. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. Given the options, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was non-malicious and the context is historical.\n"
