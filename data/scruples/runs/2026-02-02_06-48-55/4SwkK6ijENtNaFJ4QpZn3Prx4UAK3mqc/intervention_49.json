Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. The person argues that the sticker refers to the gun's WWII history, not modern politics. They mention that the phrase was coined by a famous writer from that time and that the gun itself is a historical piece. The person who criticized it found it offensive, comparing it to using the phrase to refer to modern ideologies.\n\nHmm, so I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intent is historical, connecting the sticker to the gun's possible use in WWII. However, the sticker can be interpreted as a modern political statement, especially given the current climate. Even if the original quote is from WWII, using it on a gun today might be seen as insensitive or as making a political statement, which could be offensive to some.\n\nThe author also mentions that the gun is a common model and the sticker is removable. But the issue isn't just about modifying the gun; it's about the message the sticker sends. Even if the author's intention is historical, others might not see that context. The comparison to modern uses of similar phrases could make the sticker seem like it's endorsing violence against current groups, which is problematic.\n\nThe person who called it out made a valid point about the sticker implying current use for violence. The author's defense that it's about WWII history might not be enough for everyone. While the author didn't intend any modern political connotations, the sticker's placement on a gun\u2014a weapon\u2014can be seen as promoting violence, regardless of the intent. So, the author might be in the wrong because the sticker's context can be misinterpreted or seen as insensitive to current issues, even if that wasn't their intention.\n"
