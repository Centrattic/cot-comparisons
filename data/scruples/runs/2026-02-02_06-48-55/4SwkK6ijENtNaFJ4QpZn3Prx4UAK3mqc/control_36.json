Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is into historical guns and has a Mosin Nagant made during WWII. The sticker is a reference to a WWII-era slogan, originally by Woody Guthrie. The person argues that the gun might have actually been used against fascists in the past, and they're using it now for target practice. Someone else found the sticker offensive, suggesting it implies they'd use the gun to kill people now, which the person denies.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent versus perception. The author's intent is historical appreciation, using a historical reference related to the gun's possible past. The sticker is removable and not on a modified antique. However, the other person felt it was offensive, comparing it to modern ideologies. \n\nThe author defends by saying the phrase is from WWII, like the gun. Friends sided with them. But the author is questioning if it's trashy. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The main factors are intent, context, and the impact on others. The author didn't mean to imply modern use against others, but the sticker might be misinterpreted. The phrase's origin is historical, but in today's climate, \"fascists\" can have modern political connotations. \n\nSince the author's intent is historical and the sticker is on a gun used for historical reenactment or hobby, not for actual harm, it's more about personal expression. However, others might still find it offensive regardless of intent. But the author isn't using it in a way that promotes violence now. The answer hinges on whether intent matters more than perception here. \n\nIn many cases, intent is considered, but if it causes offense, even unintentionally, some might say it's inconsiderate. However, the author is using a historical reference in a historical context. Since the friends agreed they weren't wrong, and the author didn't have malicious intent, the answer leans towards B (No). The author isn't in the wrong, as they had a historical, educational purpose and the sticker is removable. The other person's interpretation is valid, but the author's actions are justified in their context.\n"
