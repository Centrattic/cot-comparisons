Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the quote is from WWII, and they're referencing the rifle's historical context. Someone else found it offensive because it implies using the gun now to kill people, comparing it to using any ideology or group.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was actually used during WWII, notably with the M1 Carbine, and the person mentions that it's from the same era as their rifle. They clarify they have another unmodified rifle and that the sticker is removable. Their friends support them, but they're questioning if they're being insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical homage, but the other person interpreted it as modern political statement. The issue is whether the sticker's message, even if historically accurate, could be seen as offensive in today's context. \n\nThe phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a specific historical reference, but modern audiences might not make that connection and could misinterpret it as promoting violence against current groups labeled as fascists. The person argues that the comparison to other ideologies is unfair, but the problem is that the phrase is ambiguous. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the perception matters. \n\nAlso, considering that guns are inherently tools of violence, adding a slogan that implies their use in killing, even historically, might be seen as insensitivity by some. The fact that it's on a historical gun might mitigate some of that, but not entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a historical reference correctly and the sticker is removable, so they aren't permanently altering the artifact. Their friends agree they're not in the wrong, which suggests that the community they're part of doesn't see it as an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in general, not just in their friends' opinion.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action is offensive despite the intent. Since the phrase has a historical context, but the platform (a gun) and the modern audience's interpretation could lead to offense, there's a case for both sides. However, the author's intent was clear to them, but others might still find it offensive. The author might not be in the wrong because the intent was historical, but they could still be seen as insensitive if the message is perceived differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether others might find it offensive. The answer would depend on if their action is objectively wrong or if it's a matter of differing opinions. \n\nSince the author's intent is clear and the phrase is historically accurate, and they're not using it to promote current violence, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
