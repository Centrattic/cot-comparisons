Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the sticker is a nod to the historical context of the gun, which was made during WWII, and the original quote from Woody Guthrie. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same rifle.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker found it insensitive and offensive, arguing that it implies the gun could be used to kill people now, similar to using it for other ideologies. The user is torn because their intention was historical, but they're wondering if it's trashy or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original quote is from the 1940s, a time when the threat of fascism was real and immediate. The user's use of the phrase is in reference to the historical role of the rifle during WWII. However, the phrase \"kills fascists\" has a modern connotation, especially given current political climates where the term \"fascist\" is sometimes used metaphorically or in a broader sense. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The user's intention was historical and not to make a political statement, but others might interpret the sticker as implying support for using the gun to kill people now, which could be offensive. The fact that the sticker is on a functional gun (even if it's used for shooting paper) adds to the concern, as it might be seen as trivializing the phrase in a way that could be associated with violence.\n\nThe person who criticized it made a valid point about the potential implication that the user might use the gun to kill people, even if that's not the case. The user's defense about the historical origin and the removable sticker is relevant, but perception matters. Even if the intent is clear, others might not see it that way, leading to offensive interpretations.\n\nAdditionally, considering the sensitivity around gun-related items and historical symbols, the user might not be in the wrong if their intent was purely historical. But there's a line between historical appreciation and potential offense, especially when the item in question is a weapon. The user's friends sided with them, showing that not everyone finds it offensive, but the critic's reaction is also valid from their perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intent is crucial here. If they genuinely meant it as a historical reference and not as a call for violence, they might not be in the wrong. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists, which complicates the matter. The answer hinges on balancing intent with the impact on others.\n"
