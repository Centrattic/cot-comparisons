Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest, specifically in WWII-era weapons. They have a Mosin Nagant from Tula during WWII. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the original WWII slogan. The friend who confronted them feels it's insensitive because it might imply the user would use it to kill others now, which is a modern comparison. The user argues the phrase is from WWII and not meant to relate to current politics.\n\nSo, the key points: the sticker has historical context, the user's intention is historical homage, but others might misinterpret it as a modern statement. The user's friends support them. The user is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nI think the main issue is intent vs. perception. The user didn't mean any harm, but the sticker could be seen as trivializing violence or making light of current political issues. However, since the phrase is a historical reference and the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people, the user's argument has merit. Still, putting a violent slogan on a weapon, even historically, might be seen as insensitive to some. But since they clarified their intent and the context is historical, maybe they're not wrong. But I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was historical and the context was explained. However, others might still find it offensive regardless of intent. Hmm. Maybe A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user is a gun owner who uses the gun for target practice and historical interest. The sticker is removable. The original quote is from WWII. The user's explanation was given. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
