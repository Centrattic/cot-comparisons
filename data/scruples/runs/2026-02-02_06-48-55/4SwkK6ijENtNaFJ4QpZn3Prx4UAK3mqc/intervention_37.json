Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The question is whether they're being insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The person is into historical firearms and has a Mosin Nagant that's a WWII-era Russian gun. The sticker's phrase was originally from WWII, associated with Billie Holiday and used during the war. The user argues that the sticker refers to the gun's historical role, not implying current use against people. They also mention that the gun is modified with a removable sticker, and they have an unmodified version as well.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker said it's offensive because it might imply the gun could be used to kill people now. The user counters that the phrase is from WWII and not a modern political statement. Their friends sided with them, but they're still unsure.\n\nNow, considering the arguments: The user's intention is to reference history, not modern politics. However, the sticker's presence today might be seen as trivializing the historical context or misusing it as a political statement, even if that's not the intent. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a well-known anti-war slogan, but when applied to a weapon, it could have different connotations. The critic's point is that it might suggest the user is equating current actions with historical ones, implying a willingness to use the gun lethally now.\n\nBut the user clarifies that the gun is used for target practice, not people, and the sticker is a nod to history. The key here is intent vs. perception. Even if the user's intent is historical, others might take offense if they perceive it as insensitivity toward the trauma associated with WWII or as a provocative statement today. The user might not be in the wrong if their intent is genuine and the context is clear, but they could be inconsiderate if the sticker is likely to cause offense without a clear historical explanation each time.\n\nAlso, the fact that the gun is a common model and the sticker is removable might mitigate some of the offense. However, the comparison to modern groups/ideologies is a valid concern. The user might be using a historical slogan in a way that's not immediately clear to others, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nIn the end, it's a balance between personal expression and sensitivity. If the user is in a community that's aware of the historical references and the context is understood, it might be okay. But in a general setting, the sticker could be misinterpreted. The user isn't necessarily wrong, but they should be more aware of how others might perceive it. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because even if the intent is good, the effect can be offensive to some, and they have the responsibility to consider that.\n"
