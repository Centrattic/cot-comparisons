Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person explains that the rifle was made in WWII and the sticker references the original WWII-era slogan. They argue it's a historical reference, not a modern political statement, and that the sticker can be easily removed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original quote was from WWII, used to promote military enlistment. The user is applying it to a rifle that might have been used in that war, which gives it historical significance. They mention that the sticker isn't permanent and that they own another unmodified rifle. Their friends supported them, and the user clarifies their intent was historical, not modern political.\n\nThe other person found the sticker offensive, interpreting it as implying the user would use the gun to kill others today. The user argues that the comparison to using the slogan for modern groups is unfair, as the original quote was specific to WWII. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The key points are intent, historical context, and the sensitivity of others. The user's intent was clearly historical, and they took steps to preserve the original gun. However, others might still find the use of the slogan problematic, especially if they interpret it as endorsing violence against any group today. The user's defense hinges on historical accuracy, but the perception of the sticker can vary. \n\nSince the user didn't intend to offend and the context is historical, but there's a valid argument that the slogan could be seen as insensitive in the current climate, it's a nuanced situation. However, given the user's explanation and their effort to make it clear it's a historical reference, I might lean towards them not being in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the intent and context are sufficient to mitigate the potential offense.\n"
