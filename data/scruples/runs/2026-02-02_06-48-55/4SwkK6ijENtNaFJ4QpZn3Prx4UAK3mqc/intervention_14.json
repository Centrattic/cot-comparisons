Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person has a Mosin Nagant rifle from WWII and put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on it. They argue that the phrase is historical, from WWII, and not meant to reference current politics. The issue is that someone found the sticker offensive, thinking it implies they might use the gun to harm others today.\n\nFirst, the author's intention matters. They say it's a joke referencing the rifle's possible historical role. But the problem is how others perceive it. The phrase \"kills fascists\" is a known WWII slogan, but when applied to a modern gun, even if historical, could be seen as invoking violence. The person who objected argued it's similar to using the same logic for other ideologies, which points to the potential for misuse of the phrase in a modern context.\n\nThe author mentions the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified rifle, but the key issue is the symbolism. Even if the author doesn't intend it, the sticker might be interpreted as endorsing the use of the gun for political violence now. The fact that friends supported them doesn't negate the possibility that others might find it offensive. The line between historical reference and insensitive application can be thin. So, while the author's intent is historical, the risk of misinterpretation and the potential offense caused could mean they're in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
