Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a historical interest in guns and uses them at the shooting range. The Mosin Nagant was made during WWII in Russia. The sticker reference comes from a WWII-era quote by Woody Guthrie, originally for a guitar. The author uses it to reflect the rifle's potential historical role in fighting Nazis. They argue the context is historical, not modern political, and that the sticker is removable and not a big deal.\n\nNow, the person who criticized it said it's insensitive because it might imply the author would use it to kill people today. The author disagrees, pointing out the historical context and the original meaning of the quote. Their friends support them, but the author is doubting themselves.\n\nSo, the key points are: historical vs. modern context, intent vs. perception, and whether the sticker trivializes past events. The author's intent is historical homage, but the sticker's phrase has been co-opted in modern times for political purposes. The critic's point is that the phrase can be seen as suggesting current intentions, even if that's not the case. \n\nThe phrase \"This machine kills fascists\" is from a different era. The author is using it in line with the rifle's historical use. However, in modern times, the term \"fascist\" is often used metaphorically in political debates, which could lead to misunderstandings. The author might not be wrong in their intent, but the potential for misinterpretation exists. However, the author clarifies they don't mean modern applications, which is a valid defense. The fact that the sticker is removable and on a historical gun also argues against it being inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't malicious, but they need to consider how others might perceive it. However, since the phrase is historically accurate and the context is clear (using an actual WWII-era rifle), the author's use isn't inherently wrong. The comparison to modern political uses is a stretch. The critic's sensitivity might be misplaced, but the author's awareness of the potential issue shows they're considerate. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because their intent is historical, the phrase has historical roots, and the context of the rifle supports that. The critic's take is a valid opinion but not a justification for the author being wrong.\n"
