Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era gun from Russia, and the sticker references a historical quote from Woody Guthrie. The author's intention was to acknowledge the rifle's possible historical role against Nazis, not a modern political statement. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same gun. \n\nThe friend who criticized the sticker found it offensive because it might imply the author would use it to kill people today, drawing a comparison to using similar stickers for modern ideologies. The author argues that the phrase is from WWII and not meant for current issues. \n\nNow, the key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intent was historical, not to endorse violence against modern groups. However, the sticker could be seen as insensitive by some, especially if it's interpreted as promoting the use of the gun for violence now. But the author didn't intend that. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether intent matters. If the author had no malicious intent and the context is historical, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the sticker can be reasonably perceived as offensive by others, even unintentionally, there could be a case for them being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the author made a conscious choice to use a historically relevant phrase on a historical weapon. The sticker was applied with knowledge of its origin. The fact that friends supported them and the author clarified their intent might mitigate the issue. But the concern is that symbols can have multiple meanings, and even if unintended, the sticker might cause discomfort. \n\nIn similar cases, like displaying Nazi memorabilia with good intentions, the line is thin. Here, the phrase is a well-known historical reference. The author's explanation adds context. Still, the person who criticized might have a valid point if they feel the sticker trivializes the original quote's context. \n\nBut since the author's intent was educational and historical, and they clarified it wasn't about modern politics, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the sticker's placement on a gun could still raise eyebrows regardless of intent. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether intent is the main factor. If the author is in the right because of their intent, then B. If the potential for offense regardless of intent makes them wrong, then A. But given the explanation and the historical context, leaning towards B.\n"
