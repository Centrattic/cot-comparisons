Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The context is that the rifle is a historical piece from WWII, and the person uses it at a shooting range, not for actual combat. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the original quote from WWII.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main arguments. The person argues that the quote itself is from WWII and was used in a historical context against Nazis. They also mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified rifle. Their friends supported them, but someone else found it offensive because it might imply using the rifle to kill people now, especially with the modern political implications.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. perception. The author's intention is historical and humorous, referencing past events. However, the person who found it offensive saw it as a potential endorsement of using the weapon against modern ideologies or groups, which could be seen as insensitive given current issues like gun violence or political tensions.\n\nI should consider whether the use of a historical quote in a personal, non-threatening context is acceptable. The original quote was a protest against war and fascism, created by a pacifist (Woody Guthrie). The author's use of it on a historical gun might be seen as a nod to that history. On the other hand, others might argue that placing such a slogan on a functional weapon, even an antique, could be jarring or trivialize the serious historical context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people, which is a key difference from its historical use. But the sticker's message, even if historical, might still be misinterpreted. The person who objected made a comparison to using similar phrases for modern ideologies, which the author dismissed as a bad comparison. However, the comparison might highlight that the phrase's original meaning isn't universally understood, leading to potential offense.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't intend to offend and has a genuine interest in history. However, they should consider the possible interpretations of their actions. Given that the sticker is removable and the context is a shooting range with friends, it's a personal choice, but others might find it inappropriate regardless of intent. The question is whether intent absolves them of being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is at fault. If the intent was respectful and historical, and there's no malicious use, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the action could be perceived as insensitive despite intent, then there's a case against them. Since the person used a historical reference correctly and the context is non-violent (shooting at targets), it's more of a B (not in the wrong). But the fact that someone found it offensive might mean that they should reconsider, even if they're not strictly wrong. The community might split, but based on the information given, the answer is B.\n"
