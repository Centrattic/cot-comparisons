Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They argue that the phrase is historically relevant since the rifle was made during WWII and the quote was from that era. The person at the range found it offensive, suggesting it implies they'd use the gun to kill people now, which the author denies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a WWII-era slogan from the Communist Party USA, so the author is using historical context. However, the person who criticized it might be interpreting it through a modern lens, linking it to current political issues, which the author didn't intend. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intention is historical homage, but others might see it as a call to action or insensitive, especially if they associate it with modern fascism.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sticker is removable and on a historical replica. They have another unmodified gun, so it's not altering the original. But the issue is about perception. The author's friends agreed with them, but that doesn't mean others won't take offense. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using a historical reference that could be misinterpreted.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong if they intended it historically. However, they should consider how others might perceive it, especially in today's political climate where the phrase can be controversial. The answer might depend on whether the author's intent is clear, but since the sticker could be seen as provocative regardless of intent, there's a chance the author is at least partly responsible for not considering different perspectives.\n"
