Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is at fault (AITA) for having the sticker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest, specifically in WWII-era firearms. The Mosin Nagant in question is from WWII, made in Tula. The sticker references a quote from the 1940s, associated with Woody Guthrie, which was meant to be a rallying call against fascism during the war. The author explains that they put the sticker on a rifle they shoot at the range, not for use in any real conflict, and that they have another unmodified one.\n\nThe conflict arises when someone at the shooting range found the sticker insensitive/offensive. The person argues that the sticker could imply the author would use the gun to kill others, drawing a comparison to using the phrase with other ideologies or groups. The author defends it by pointing out the historical context of the phrase and the rifle's origin.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. I need to assess if the author's action was inappropriate.\n\nSo, key points to consider:\n\n1. **Intent vs. Perception**: The author intended the sticker to reference the historical use of the rifle during WWII, not to advocate violence now. However, others might perceive it as suggesting present-day use against fascists or as a provocative statement.\n\n2. **Historical Accuracy**: The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed from the 1940s, associated with Guthrie's work. The author is using it in a way that aligns with its original context. But does that matter in today's context?\n\n3. **Sensitivity and Respect**: Even if the intention is historical, attaching such a slogan to a weapon might be seen as insensitive, especially if it could be interpreted as glorifying violence or trivializing the phrase's serious origin.\n\n4. **Gun Sticker Context**: Stickers on guns can be seen as promotional or aggressive, regardless of intent. Some might find any slogan on a weapon offensive, even if it's historical.\n\n5. **Comparison to Other Ideologies**: The person who confronted the author suggested that the sticker could imply support for using the gun against other ideologies. The author argues that the phrase is tied to WWII, but others might not draw that distinction.\n\n6. **Gun Ownership and Perception**: In the U.S., gun ownership is a sensitive topic. Any decoration or slogan on a gun can be subject to interpretation, and what's seen as historical appreciation might be seen as provocative by others.\n\n7. **Author's Defense**: The author mentions the sticker is removable and that they have an unmodified version. They also note that Mosin Nagants are common, so it's not a rare or valuable antique affected.\n\nNow, considering all this, the author's action is likely not malicious. They are engaging in historical appreciation. However, the issue is whether placing a slogan linked to violence on a gun, even if historical, is inconsiderate. The person who objected might be overreacting, but the author could be unaware of how their action is perceived. The key is whether the sticker's placement on a modern gun could reasonably be seen as insensitive, regardless of intent.\n\nThe quote itself is from a time of war, and using it on a weapon from that era might be seen as historically accurate. However, attaching it to a gun that's used for sport might trivialize the original context. On the other hand, the author is using it in a historical context, not as a threat. The comparison to other ideologies might not hold because the original phrase was specifically about WWII and Nazis, not modern groups. Still, the sticker could be misinterpreted.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author may not be in the wrong if they had no malicious intent and the sticker is historically accurate. But there's a chance that their action could offend someone, even if unintentionally. The person who confronted them had a valid concern about the perception of using a weapon with such a slogan. However, since the author's intention was historical and not to threaten anyone, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer hinges on whether intent or perception is more important. If the author is in a community where such historical references are understood and accepted, then maybe not. If not, the perception is valid. But since the user is asking for a definitive answer (A or B), I need to decide.\n\nIn the AITA format, the answer often considers both perspectives. The author's friends supported them, but the person who objected felt it was offensive. The author's defense is strong, but there's a possibility that the sticker could be seen as insensitive regardless of intent. However, the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong (B). But some might argue that placing any slogan on a weapon is inherently problematic. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author had no malicious intent and the phrase is part of history, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong). However, if the sticker's presence, regardless of intent, is offensive, then A. But since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to decide. I think the key is that the author's intention was historical and the sticker is removable and not on a pristine antique. So, B is the answer.\n"
