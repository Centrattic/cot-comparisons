Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person explains that the rifle is a WWII-era historical item, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing its possible use back then. They argue that the phrase comes from WWII and isn't meant to imply current political sentiments. Someone else at the range found it offensive, saying it implies the user would use the gun to kill people now, comparing it to similar stickers with different ideologies.\n\nHmm. The author's intention is clearly historical, tying the sticker to the rifle's past. They mention the phrase's origin and that the gun isn't modified. But the other person's reaction is that it's insensitive because it could be seen as advocating violence against modern groups. The author's friends supported them, but they're unsure.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is using historical context and the phrase isn't inherently malicious. On the other, the presence of a sticker on a gun might be misinterpreted, especially in the current climate where such phrases can be co-opted for modern political statements. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, others might take offense. Also, the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a classic example from WWII, so it's a specific historical reference. However, the fact that it's on a gun now could be problematic to some, regardless of intent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the sticker is taken out of context or if it's seen as promoting violence, even if that's not the case, maybe they are slightly insensitive. But the key here is that the author didn't have any malicious intent and the context is historical. The other person's comparison to using the same phrase for other ideologies is a stretch because the original phrase is specifically tied to WWII. The author also has another unmodified gun, so the sticker isn't altering the historical value of the piece. \n\nIn the end, since the author's intention was historical and the sticker is removable, it's more about the other person's sensitivity rather than the author being wrong. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
