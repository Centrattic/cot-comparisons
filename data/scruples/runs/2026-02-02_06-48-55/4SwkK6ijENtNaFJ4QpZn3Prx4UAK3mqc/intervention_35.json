Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the sticker is referencing the historical context of the rifle and the original quote from WWII, created by Woody Guthrie. Others found it insensitive, possibly implying a modern political stance or suggesting the use of the gun to kill people now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that the sticker is on a historical gun, and the phrase is a historical reference. The user also clarifies that they don't mean it in a modern sense but as a nod to the past. However, the person who confronted them argued that the sticker could be interpreted as justifying the use of the gun to kill others now, similar to other ideologies. The user's friends supported them.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The user intended it as a historical reference, but others might not see the historical context and instead focus on the modern implications. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is well-known from the past, but in today's climate, especially with political tensions, it might be seen differently. The user is using a weapon, which inherently has a dual nature\u2014historical and current. Even though the user has another unmodified rifle, the sticker on the current one could be seen as trivializing the history of violence or making a political statement.\n\nAlso, the user's friends sided with them, but that doesn't necessarily mean the concern is invalid. The person who found it offensive might be reacting to the possibility of the sticker being used to justify violence, even if that's not the user's intent. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how others might perceive it without the historical context, especially in a social setting where the sticker is visible to others who might not share the same knowledge or perspective.\n\nBut then again, the user isn't using the gun for violence now and the sticker is removable. It's a hobby, and they have a legitimate interest in history. However, the line between historical appreciation and political symbolism can be thin. The user might not be in the wrong because they had a specific, historical intent and the sticker is not being used in a harmful way. But others might still find it offensive regardless of intent.\n\nI need to weigh intent against the potential for offense. Since the user's friends supported them, maybe the community around them accepts this. But the person who confronted them is part of a broader society where such phrases can be politically charged. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't anticipate how others might interpret the sticker, even if their intent was purely historical. Alternatively, if they clearly communicated their intent and the context, they might not be in the wrong. However, in the situation described, the user didn't clarify the historical reference at the time, leading to the misunderstanding. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong because their intent was genuine, but they could be seen as insensitive for not considering others' perspectives. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether they should have considered others. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether intent or impact is more important. If the impact on others matters, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if the intent was historical and the sticker isn't causing actual harm, they might not be. The answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards not in the wrong (B) because their intent was historical and the sticker is removable and part of a hobby. However, the person who found it offensive is also justified in their perspective. But the user is not in the wrong because they didn't intend to offend and the sticker is part of their historical appreciation.\n"
