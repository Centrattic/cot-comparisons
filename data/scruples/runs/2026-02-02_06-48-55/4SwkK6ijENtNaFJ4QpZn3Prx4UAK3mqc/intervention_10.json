Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a gun enthusiast with a love for historical guns. They own a Mosin Nagant from WWII, made in Tula. They put the sticker on it as a joke, referencing the original WWII context. The sticker was meant to nod to the historical use of the rifle during the war. When someone found it offensive, the author defended it by explaining the historical context and that the phrase itself is from that era, like the song \"My Land is Your Land.\" Their friends agreed with them.\n\nNow, the person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies the author would use it to kill others now, comparing it to using the phrase against other ideologies. The author countered that the phrase isn't modern and that the gun's current use is just for shooting at targets.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are intent, context, and perception. The author's intent was to reference historical use, not to make a political statement today. However, the sticker could be interpreted in different ways. The person who found it offensive might see the phrase as being co-opted in modern contexts, such as far-left or far-right groups using it for their own purposes. The author's argument is that the phrase is from the original era and the gun is a historical artifact, so the context is clear.\n\nBut does using a phrase that's been politicized today, even if historically accurate, cross a line? The author is using a gun, which is inherently a weapon, so adding a slogan that could be seen as promoting violence might be problematic. Even if the author's intention is historical, others might not get that nuance. The comparison made by the person who confronted them is a valid concern\u2014using such a phrase on a weapon could imply support for using it against certain groups now.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version. They don't use the gun for anything other than target practice. Their friends support them, so maybe the issue is subjective.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their action was insensitive. Even if the intent was historical, the sticker's presence on a gun might be seen as insensitive because it's a weapon, and the phrase is often used in modern political contexts. The author might not realize how the phrase is perceived today, but that doesn't absolve them. The other person's perspective is that it's offensive because it could imply current violent intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a historical artifact and referencing a historical phrase. The original quote is from WWII, and the gun was used then. So there's a valid historical context. The problem arises when the phrase is taken out of that context and applied in a way that might be seen as promoting violence today.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action was insensitive regardless of intent. Even if the intent is historical, the sticker on a gun could be seen as trivializing or misusing the phrase in a way that's offensive. The author might not be in the wrong because their intent was innocent, but the impact on others is still a factor. However, since the author didn't mean to offend and the context is explained, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering that the sticker is on a weapon, which is inherently violent, even a historical reference might be seen as insensitive. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because the sticker's placement on a gun can be perceived as promoting violence, even if the intent was historical. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B could be the case if the intent is respected and the context is clear. Hmm.\n"
