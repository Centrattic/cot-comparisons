Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The Mosin Nagant is a historical WWII-era rifle from Russia. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Woody Guthrie during WWII, referencing the StG 44, which was used against Nazis. The user is using it on a historical gun that was made during the same period. The user argues that the sticker is a nod to the rifle's possible historical use in WWII, not a modern statement.\n\nThe person who criticized it says it's offensive because it might imply the user would use the gun to kill people today, comparing it to using other ideologies. The user counters that the phrase is historical and the rifle is just for shooting paper at a range now.\n\nI should consider if the sticker's message is inappropriate. Using a phrase from a historical context on a historical weapon might not be inherently offensive, especially if the user's intent is historical homage. However, the concern is that it could be misinterpreted as supporting violence against certain groups now. But the user clarifies that the phrase refers to WWII context and not modern politics.\n\nAlso, the user has another unmodified Mosin, and the sticker is removable, which they mention as part of their argument. Their friends supported them, and the user feels the comparison to other ideologies is unfair.\n\nThe key factors are intent, historical context, and potential for misinterpretation. If the user's intention is purely historical and they make that clear, then it's less likely they're in the wrong. But if someone could reasonably take offense due to the phrase's association with violence, even if historical, there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because their explanation shows the historical intent and they're using it on a non-functional or modified antique. The phrase is a historical reference, not a modern endorsement of violence. However, some might still find it insensitive regardless of intent. But given the user's reasoning and the context, they probably aren't at fault.\n"
