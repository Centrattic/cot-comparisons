Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for having a \"This machine kills fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author uses historical context, explaining that the rifle is a WWII-era gun from Tula, and the sticker is a reference to the original WWII usage. They argue it's not about modern politics but historical relevance.\n\nThe criticizer found it insensitive, suggesting it implies the author would use the rifle to kill others. The author counters that the phrase has historical roots and the gun is just for shooting paper now. Friends supported them, but the author is conflicted.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's action is insensitive. The key points are the context of the sticker, the historical reference, and the perception of others. The phrase \"This machine kills fascists\" is historically tied to WWII, so using it on a gun from that era might be seen as appropriate by some. However, the author is aware that others might misinterpret it in a modern context, especially with current political ideologies associated with fascism.\n\nThe author's intention was historical, not modern, but the sticker can be seen as a provocation if someone connects it to current issues. Even if the author's intent is clear, the potential for misunderstanding exists. The criticizer's concern is about the implication of using the gun to kill people today, which the author argues isn't the case because they only shoot paper. However, the presence of such a sticker might still make others uncomfortable, regardless of intent.\n\nThe author's justification is that the phrase has historical significance and the gun is part of their historical collection. But the issue is whether their personal use crosses into insensitivity. Since the phrase can be interpreted in multiple ways and the criticizer felt offended, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how others could perceive it. It's about balancing personal expression with societal sensitivity. The author might not be malicious, but their action could still be seen as insensitive to others' feelings.\n"
