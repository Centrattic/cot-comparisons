Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author's reasoning is that the rifle is a WWII-era gun, and the sticker references the original quote from WWII. They argue it's historical and not meant to be offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The original quote by Pete Seeger was meant to highlight the role of the M1 rifle in defeating fascism during WWII. The author is applying it to a Russian rifle used in the same era, which might be a bit anachronistic since the Mosin Nagant was used in various conflicts before and during WWII. However, the author acknowledges that their gun could have been used in WWII, given its production time.\n\nNow, the criticism from the friend is that the sticker is insensitive because it could imply that the author is using the gun to kill people in the modern context, especially with current political ideologies labeled as \"fascist.\" The author counters that they don't mean modern politics and it's purely historical. But does the sticker's placement on a functional gun (even if for hobby) risk being misinterpreted as a call to action or glorifying violence against certain groups today?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of modifying historical items. The author mentions that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. However, some might still see it as disrespectful to a historical artifact, even if it's not permanent. But since the author is aware and can remove it, maybe that's less of an issue.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, so there's some social support. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The original intent was historical, but the potential for misunderstanding exists. The author didn't intend to refer to modern politics, but others might not see the distinction. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is tied to a specific historical context, but using it on a weapon today could be seen as insensitive given current events and the rise of far-right movements. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't using it to glorify violence against modern groups but to reflect the gun's past. It's a historical reference. But the line between historical appreciation and modern political statement can be blurry. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent is purely historical and they're aware of the sticker's origins. However, the sensitivity of others is valid, so the author should consider removing it to avoid causing offense, even if they don't agree with the criticism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is historical, the sticker's placement on a gun could be misinterpreted, leading others to see it as a modern political statement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how it could be perceived by others beyond their own understanding.\n"
