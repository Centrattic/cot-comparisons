My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a pet fish and then taking it back. The situation starts with the niece banging on the aquarium, which stresses the fish. Then she throws a tantrum wanting the fish. The author gives in and gives her the fish, but the niece shakes the bag, so the author takes it back. The brother is annoyed and they end up in an argument. The author apologizes later to keep the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they were trying to be generous, but the niece was being inconsiderate. The niece's actions were harmful to the fish, so the author took it back to protect the pet. The brother felt the author was overreacting, leading to tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the niece was a child acting out. Maybe she didn't realize the fish could be harmed. The brother might see the fish as a small thing to give away. The author's decision to take the fish back could be seen as a breach of trust, but the niece was mistreating it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving the fish might have been a mistake if they knew the niece wouldn't take care of it. But the niece's behavior was problematic. The author had a right to protect the fish from harm. However, taking it back after giving it might cause hurt feelings. The brother might feel disrespected. But the main issue is the niece's treatment of the fish. The author's action was to prevent harm, which seems justified. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The key points are the niece's mistreatment and the author's intent to protect the fish. The brother's annoyance is a result of the situation, but the author's actions were in response to harm.\n"
