My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts their brother's family for dinner. The niece bangs on the fish tank, causing stress to the fish. She then throws a tantrum and wants a specific fish. The author gives in, gives her the fish, but when the niece shakes it, the author takes it back. The brother is upset, and the author apologizes later.\n\nSo, the key points here. The niece was being disruptive, leading to stress on the fish. The author gave her the fish to stop the tantrum. Then, when the niece mishandled the fish, the author took it back. The brother felt the author was overreacting, while the author thought the child was spoiled. The author apologized to save the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Gifting a live fish is a big responsibility. If the niece isn't capable of handling it properly, maybe the author shouldn't have given it in the first place. However, the author did give it to the niece, so taking it back after mishandling could be seen as reasonable. The niece's behavior was problematic; she was being careless with the fish. The author's action to protect the fish makes sense from an animal welfare perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to give the fish might have been hasty. Maybe they should have considered if the niece could care for it. Also, taking it back in front of the brother might have caused embarrassment. However, the main issue is the niece's treatment of the fish. The author acted to prevent harm to the fish, which is a valid concern. The brother might have felt the author was being too strict, but the author's priority was the fish's well-being. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the fish was their property, they have the right to remove it if they believe it's being mistreated. The niece's actions were negligent, so the author's response was justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
