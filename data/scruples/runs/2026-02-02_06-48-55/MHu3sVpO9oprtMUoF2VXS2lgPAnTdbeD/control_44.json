My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a conflict between the author and their brother over a pet fish given to the niece.\n\nFirst, the author invited the brother and his family over. During the visit, the niece started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. She then had a tantrum demanding the white clownfish. The author, wanting to avoid conflict, gave the fish to the brother. However, the niece shook the bag, the author took it back, leading to more conflict and the brother leaving.\n\nSo, the author's actions: giving the fish initially, then taking it back. The key points to consider are the intent and the context. The author wanted to maintain the relationship with the brother. The niece's behavior was disruptive. The author tried to reason but gave in to prevent her brother from being uncomfortable. Then, when the niece mishandled the fish, the author took it back to protect the fish, which caused the brother to be annoyed.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the fish was in the author's tank. They didn't own it, but maybe it was a personal fish. Giving it away might have been a mistake, but under pressure. Then taking it back could be seen as rescinding a gift, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the niece's treatment of the fish was abusive. The author had a legitimate concern about the fish's well-being. The brother's reaction might be because he felt the author was being inconsistent, but the author's actions were to protect the fish. The initial gift was perhaps a mistake, but the subsequent action was to correct a harmful situation. So, the author's intentions were to protect the fish and maintain family peace. The brother's daughter's behavior was problematic, and the author had to step in. The author did apologize, which shows they care about the relationship. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The author did give the fish and then take it back, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but the context of the niece's actions and the fish's welfare is important. The main question is whether the author had the right to take back the fish. If the fish was a gift, taking it back is problematic. But if it was never a true gift and the owner decided to take it back for valid reasons, maybe not. The author's ownership of the fish isn't clear. If the fish was theirs, they can make that decision. So, depending on that, but the main issue is the niece's behavior and the author's response to protect the fish. So the answer is B.\n"
