My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a niece a pet fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's brother's daughter was being disruptive during dinner, banging on the fish tank, throwing a tantrum for a specific fish. The author gave the fish to the brother to stop the tantrum. Then the niece started shaking the fish bag, so the author took it back. The brother got upset, and the author apologized, but now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Let's consider a few angles. The niece was clearly misbehaving, which could justify the author's decision to take the fish back. The initial giving of the fish was to stop the tantrum, which might be seen as a kind gesture, but then the niece's subsequent actions (shaking the bag) could be a reason to reclaim it. The author also had a good relationship with the brother, which they prioritized by apologizing. \n\nHowever, maybe the author overstepped by taking the fish back in front of the niece, especially after already giving it. It might have been better to address the behavior with the parents rather than taking the fish. Also, the brother's reaction could indicate that he felt the author wasn't respecting his family dynamics. \n\nBut the niece's behavior was problematic. The author was trying to protect the fish from harm. So, while the initial giving might have been a mistake (maybe gifting a fish without considering the child's maturity), the retrieval could be seen as necessary. \n\nIn terms of fault, the main issue is the author's decision to take back the fish after giving it. If the brother had agreed to take responsibility, maybe the author should have followed through. But since the niece was mistreating the fish, the author had a valid reason. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The niece's actions were concerning, and the author acted to protect the fish. However, there might be room for improvement in how the situation was handled. But overall, the answer is B (No).\n"
