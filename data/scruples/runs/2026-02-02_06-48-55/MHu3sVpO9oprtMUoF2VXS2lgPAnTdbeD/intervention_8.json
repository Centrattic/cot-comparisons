My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about giving a niece a pet fish and then taking it back. The person invited their brother and his family over for dinner. The niece started bangin on the fish tank, stressing the fish, then had a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The person gave her the fish, but then the niece shook the bag and laughed. The person took the fish back, leading to conflict with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to be generous, giving the fish to their niece to stop her tantrum. But then, when the niece shook the bag, the author took it back, which upset the brother. The brother might feel that the author was being inconsistent\u2014giving the fish and then taking it away, causing more issues. The niece's behavior was definitely problematic, but the author's decision to take the fish back might have been unkind, especially in front of the family. Also, maybe the author should have discussed this with the brother first instead of acting on their own. The brother's reaction was to ask the author to give the fish to the niece, and the author's comment about the niece being spoiled might have been the last straw. The author apologized later, which shows they care about the relationship but maybe acted impulsively. On the other hand, the niece's actions were disrespectful to the fish and the author's property. The author had the right to take the fish back if they felt it was being mishandled. However, the way they handled it might have been abrupt and without considering the brother's perspective. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author gave the fish as a gift, then took it back, causing conflict, maybe they are in the wrong. The key points are the initial decision to give the fish under pressure from the niece's tantrum, then taking it back without considering the brother's feelings. The author's actions might have been selfish in trying to protect the fish but ended up hurting the relationship. So I think the answer is A.\n"
