My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a fish given to the niece, then taken back. The author gave the fish to the niece to stop her tantrum, but then took it back when the niece was being careless. The brother got annoyed, and the author apologized to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave the fish out of the aquarium to the niece, which might have been a good gesture to calm her. But when the niece started shaking the bag and the author took it back, that's where the conflict arises. The brother felt the author was overreacting and wanted the fish to be given to the girl to stop the tantrum. The author thought the niece was being spoiled and needed discipline.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. On one hand, the author's intention was to protect the fish from being harmed. The niece's behavior was indeed careless, so taking the fish back could be seen as necessary. On the other hand, giving the fish up initially might have been a kind gesture, but taking it back abruptly could have caused embarrassment or hurt the niece's feelings. The brother's reaction suggests he felt the fish was not important enough to cause conflict. \n\nThe author apologized to the brother, which indicates they valued the relationship over the fish. But the brother's annoyance and the author's frustration with the niece's behavior are both valid. The niece's actions were problematic, but the author's response might have been too harsh. Maybe a better approach would have been to explain to the niece why she shouldn't shake the fish and perhaps find another way to soothe her without giving up the fish. However, once the fish was given, taking it back might have been seen as breaking trust. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might have been in giving the fish to the niece in the first place if they weren't ready to part with it. Alternatively, once given, the author had to accept the consequences of the niece's handling. But since the niece was being careless, the author had a right to protect the fish. It's a bit of a dilemma. The key issue is whether the author had the right to take back the fish after giving it. If the fish was a gift, then taking it back could be seen as wrong. However, if it was a loan or a temporary handover, maybe it's okay. The article of the situation is a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the niece's behavior was the root problem. The author might have overstepped by taking the fish back after giving it, leading to the brother's annoyance. The brother's reaction, while maybe short-sighted, is also a factor. The author's apology shows they prioritized the relationship, which is positive. But the initial decision to give the fish and then take it back might be where they went wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the author is partially at fault for giving the fish as a gift but then taking it back, which could be seen as breaking a promise. However, the niece's behavior was also problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some views, the author had the right to protect their property. In others, once given as a gift, it's not their decision to take back. Since the fish was from the author's tank, they might have the right to take it back. But the way they did it without consulting the niece or the brother properly might be the issue. \n\nOverall, I think the author is somewhat at fault for not considering the implications of taking back the fish after giving it, but the niece's behavior was definitely a contributing factor. The brother's response also wasn't ideal. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they did take the fish back without perhaps a better approach, it's possible they are at fault. So I lean towards answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
