My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about giving a pet fish to the niece and then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the author had a dinner with their brother's family. The niece, who is 13, starts banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then she throws a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author gives in and gives the fish to the brother's family. The niece then shakes the fish bag, and the author takes it back, leading to tension with the brother.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author gave the fish as a gift, but then took it back. If someone gives a gift, taking it back might be seen as inconsiderate, especially in front of the recipient's family. The niece was being difficult, but the author's decision to give the fish might have been to avoid conflict in front of their brother. However, taking it back in front of the family could have caused embarrassment to the brother and the niece.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect the fish from being shaken, which is understandable. But the way they handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe there was a better way to handle the situation without causing a rift. The brother felt the author was overreacting, which led to the argument. The author apologized to maintain the brother relationship, which shows they value the bond, but the initial decision to give and take back the fish might have been the root cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the niece's behavior was problematic. She was throwing a tantrum and being disrespectful to the fish. The author's concern about her shaking the bag is valid. However, perhaps the author should have addressed the niece's behavior through the parents rather than taking the fish back themselves. Maybe the author didn't consider the brother's feelings when taking the fish back, leading to the brother feeling disrespected.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the niece's actions were inappropriate, but the author's actions might have been a reaction to protect the fish. However, giving a gift and then taking it back can be seen as a breach of trust or kindness. The brother might have felt that the author was undermining their parenting by taking the fish back in front of them.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were partly a response to the niece's behavior, but the way they handled it caused conflict. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility. But maybe the brother and niece also have their part in the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author gave the fish and then took it back, which is a reversal that could be seen as inconsiderate, especially without discussing it with the brother first, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, if the author's main concern was the fish's well-being, maybe they have a valid point. But the key is that the author's actions led to a conflict with the brother. So maybe the answer is A because they gave and took back the fish without considering the brother's perspective and the family dynamics.\n"
