My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author gave their niece a fish. That's a nice gesture, but maybe they didn't consider the child's age or maturity. The niece was 13, so maybe she's more aware of the implications. But she was acting out by throwing a tantrum, which might be typical for a teenager. The author gave the fish to the niece, but then took it back because the niece was shaking the bag and the author was concerned about the fish's safety.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to take back the fish? The fish was given as a gift, but maybe the author felt that the niece wasn't responsible enough. However, once a gift is given, it becomes the recipient's property. The author taking it back could be seen as invalidating the gift, especially since it was given in the presence of the brother, which might have embarrassed him. The brother's reaction was to support his daughter, which could lead to tension between the siblings.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to protect the fish, but after giving it away, the ownership transferred. The niece's behavior was problematic, but the author's response was to take the fish back, which might not be the right approach. Maybe the author should have discussed the fish's care with the niece and her parents before giving it, ensuring it would be treated properly. But once given, taking it back might harm the relationship more than the fish's well-being.\n\nThe brother felt the author was overreacting, and the argument led to the brother leaving. The author apologized later to mend the relationship, which is a good move. However, the initial action of taking back the fish without consulting the brother could be seen as overstepping. The brother's annoyance might stem from feeling that the author undermined his parenting or made him look bad in front of his family.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intention was good to protect the fish, but the method of taking it back might have been wrong. Gifts are meant to be given with the understanding that the recipient can care for them. If the author was concerned about the fish's well-being, maybe they should have discussed care instructions or set up a different arrangement instead of taking it back. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more diplomatically, even if their concern was valid.\n"
