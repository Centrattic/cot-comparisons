My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a fish tank with a white clownfish that cost $40. The niece started banging on the tank, which stressed the fish. Then she threw a tantrum wanting the fish. The author, wanting to help their brother and maintain the relationship, gave the fish to the brother. The niece then shook the fish bag, which the author saw as trying to kill it, so they took it back. The brother got annoyed and left, and the author apologized later to keep things good with their brother.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. Let me think. The author gave the fish as a gesture to calm the situation and make the niece happy. But when the niece started shaking the bag, the author took it back, which upset the brother. The brother's reaction was to tell the author to just give the fish away. The author then took back the apology to maintain their relationship with the brother.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author gave the fish initially to help resolve the niece's tantrum. But taking it back might have been necessary to protect the fish's well-being. However, the brother's reaction suggests he felt the author was being ungenerous. The niece's behavior was spoiled, and the author's frustration is understandable. But did the author overreact by taking the fish back in front of the family? Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the niece calmly about being gentle with the fish instead of snatching it away. That might have avoided the confrontation with the brother. Also, the initial decision to give the fish might have been a bit impulsive under pressure. However, the author's concern for the fish's safety was valid. So, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were to protect the fish and set a boundary, but it might have been better to handle it in a way that didn't escalate the conflict with the brother. Still, the author tried to apologize later to maintain the relationship. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The brother's daughter was being difficult, and the author had to make a quick decision under stress. The key is whether the author had the right to take back the fish, given the niece's treatment of it. If the fish was a personal possession, the author is within their rights to take it back. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
