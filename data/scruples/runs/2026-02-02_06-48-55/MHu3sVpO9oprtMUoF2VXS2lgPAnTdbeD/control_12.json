My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author hosted their brother and his family. The niece started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum wanting a specific fish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but then the niece shook the fish bag, ignored the author's warning, so the author took the fish back. The brother was annoyed, the author apologized to maintain the relationship. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are the actions of the niece, the author's decisions, and the brother's reaction. The niece's behavior was disruptive and potentially harmful to the fish. The author gave the fish as a gift but then took it back because of the niece's mistreatment. The brother was on the side of the child, telling the author to just give it to her.\n\nFirst, gifting a fish that's part of a personal collection might be an issue. If the fish was a pet the author owned and kept in their tank, giving it away might be a problem, especially if it was a significant expense. The author mentions it cost $40, which isn't huge but still a consideration.\n\nThen, the niece's actions: shaking the bag could harm the fish. The author had a valid concern here. The niece was being careless, so the author's decision to take the fish back was to protect the animal. However, the author had already given it away, so taking it back might cause conflict with the brother. The brother's reaction was to side with the niece, which the author found annoying, so they apologized to mend things.\n\nNow, who is in the wrong? The niece's behavior was problematic, but the author's actions could be seen as overstepping. If the fish was a gift, taking it back after giving it might be seen as rude. However, the niece was mistreating the fish, so the author's concern for the animal's well-being is understandable. The brother's reaction was to dismiss the author's concerns, which could indicate poor parenting, but the author might have handled it differently, perhaps by discussing with the parents first instead of taking the fish back.\n\nThe author did apologize, which shows they wanted to maintain the relationship, which is important. But the key is whether giving the fish and then taking it back was wrong. If the fish was a personal pet, giving it away without considering the niece's ability to care for it might be an issue. However, the immediate problem was the niece's mistreatment. So the author's actions could be seen as trying to protect the fish, but perhaps they should have handled it differently, like talking to the parents instead of taking the fish directly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the niece's behavior was the root cause. The author's response might be justified, but the method could have been better. However, the author's apology helped mend the relationship. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author's actions were to protect the fish, but taking it back after giving it might have been insensitive. On the other hand, the niece's actions were clearly problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms or expectations around gift-giving and parental responsibility.\n\nIn many cases, gifting a pet requires ensuring it's safe and that the recipient can care for it. The author might have not considered that the niece would mishandle it. But once the fish was given, taking it back could be seen as breaking trust. However, the niece's actions were harmful, so the author's concern was valid. The brother's annoyance might stem from not wanting to disappoint his daughter, which is a different issue. The author's decision to apologize to preserve their relationship is a sign of maturity, but they might have handled the situation better initially.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting the fish, but they could have handled it more diplomatically. However, the answer requires choosing between A or B. If the community typically sides with the person who took action to protect their property (the fish), then B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. But if the act of taking back a gift is considered wrong, then A. But given the context, the niece's behavior justifies the action, so B is more likely.\n"
