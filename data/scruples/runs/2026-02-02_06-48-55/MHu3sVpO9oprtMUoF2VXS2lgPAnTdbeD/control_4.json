My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and his family for dinner. The brother helped them a lot in university, so there's a strong bond between them. After dinner, the niece starts banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. Then she throws a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author tries to comfort her but she keeps fussing. So, the author gives the fish to the brother. The niece takes it, shakes the bag, ignores the author's warnings, and the author takes it back. The brother gets annoyed and tells the author to just give the fish to the niece. The author tells the brother to discipline her, which leads to the brother leaving. The author apologizes two days later to mend the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author gave the fish to the niece to stop the tantrum, but then took it back when they saw how the niece was handling it. The fish's well-being might be a concern here. The niece's actions could be harmful, so the author had a reason to take it back. Also, the author apologized to the brother to preserve their relationship, showing they valued the brother's friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initially gave the fish as a gift, which the niece wanted, and then took it back. The brother might have felt the author was being inconsistent or undermining his authority as a parent. The author's comment about the niece being spoiled could have been hurtful, leading to the argument. The brother might have felt that the author was overstepping by taking the fish back in front of the family.\n\nLegally, the fish was the author's property. Giving it away would transfer ownership, but taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author might have done so to protect the fish from harm, which is a valid concern. Emotionally, the brother might have felt disrespected when the author took the fish back and criticized his parenting.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for adults to make decisions based on the well-being of pets, even if it means changing their initial decision. However, not consulting the brother before taking the fish back might have been a misstep. The author's actions could have been more diplomatic. Instead of taking the fish back publicly, they might have discussed it with the brother first.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention to protect the fish, the immediate reaction to a potentially harmful situation, and the effort to apologize later. The brother's reaction and the family dynamics also play a role. The niece's behavior was problematic, but the author might have handled it differently.\n\nOverall, while the author had good intentions, the method of handling the situation could have been better. Taking the fish back without consulting the brother might have caused more harm to the relationship. However, the author did apologize, showing they recognized the importance of the brother's feelings. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author acted to protect the fish and made amends, but there's some nuance. However, in AITA standards, the focus is on whether they did something wrong. Since the fish was theirs, they had the right to take it back if it was in danger. So B is more likely correct.\n"
