My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's niece started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum and demanded the white clownfish. The author, wanting to maintain good relations with their brother, gave the fish to the brother, but the niece shook it and laughed. Then the author took it back, leading to conflict with the brother.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The niece's actions were clearly disruptive and harmful to the fish. The author gave the fish as a gift, probably to stop the tantrum, but the niece's behavior after receiving it was problematic. The author's decision to take it back was because the niece was mistreating the fish. The brother felt the author overreacted and took it personally.\n\nThe key points are: the niece's behavior was unkind to the fish, the author gave the fish in a moment of stress to stop the tantrum, but then had to take it back to prevent harm. The brother felt disrespected by the author's comment about the daughter being spoiled. However, the author's concern for the fish's well-being is valid. The niece's actions could have killed the fish, so taking it back was a responsible action. The author did apologize to the brother to mend the relationship, showing they value the brother's friendship more than the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's initial action of giving the fish was to ease the situation, but then taking it back was necessary to prevent harm. The niece's mistreatment is the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting the fish and making a difficult decision despite the brother's reaction. The brother might have overreacted, but the author's actions were justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
