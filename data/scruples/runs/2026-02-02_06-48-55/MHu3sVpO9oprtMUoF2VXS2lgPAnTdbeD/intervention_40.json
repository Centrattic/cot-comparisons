My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author invited their brother and family over. The niece was acting out, banging on the fish tank, throwing a tantrum to get the fish. The author gave in and gave the fish to the niece, but then took it back when she was shaking it. The brother was upset that the author didn't let the niece keep it, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the main points here. Did the author go too far? Let's consider both sides. The niece's behavior was disruptive and potentially harmful to the fish. The author's tank is their personal property, and they have the right to protect their belongings. However, giving the fish as a gift and then taking it back might seem like an overreaction, especially since the niece was just excited, according to her father. But the niece was being careless with the fish, shaking the bag, which could stress or harm the fish.\n\nThe author's intent was to stop the niece from harming the fish. They tried to give in to calm the situation but couldn't let the fish be mistreated. The brother felt the author was too harsh, but the author had a valid concern for the fish's well-being. The key here is balancing the niece's happiness with the fish's safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might argue that once the fish was given, it's his family's responsibility. The author's decision to take it back could be seen as undermining the brother's parenting. However, the niece was actively harming the fish, which might justify the author's actions. \n\nThe author did apologize afterward, showing they valued the brother's relationship over the conflict. So maybe the author wasn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it differently, maybe by discussing with the brother first before taking the fish back. But given the immediate threat to the fish, taking action might have been necessary. \n\nHmm. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their property. But there's some nuance here. The answer might be B (No), as the author had a legitimate reason to take back the fish for its safety, even if it caused tension with the brother.\n"
