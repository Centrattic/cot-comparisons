My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. The situation involves a 13-year-old girl who was being disruptive at dinner by banging on the fish tank and having a tantrum to get the fish. The author, wanting to avoid conflict with their brother, gave the fish to the niece, but then took it back when the niece shook the bag. The brother was upset, and the author apologized later to mend the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The niece's behavior was clearly problematic. She was being disruptive, throwing a tantrum, and then shaking the fish bag, which could harm the fish. The author's initial action of giving the fish was to stop the tantrum and maintain family harmony, which makes sense. However, when the niece started shaking the bag, the author took it back to prevent harm to the fish. The brother felt that the author was overreacting and that the niece was just excited.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether the author had the right to take back the fish after giving it. The niece's actions endangered the fish, so the author's concern for the fish's well-being might be justified. However, once the fish was given as a gift, taking it back could be seen as breaking trust with the brother. The author's main motivation was to protect the fish and prevent harm, but the brother's perspective is about his daughter's happiness and the author's overreaction.\n\nAnother angle is the initial decision to give the fish. The author might not have considered the niece's maturity level to care for a pet, which could be a flaw. However, the niece's behavior made it clear she wasn't treating the fish responsibly. The author's response was to intervene when the fish was in immediate danger. The brother's annoyance might stem from feeling his daughter was being criticized, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author acted to prevent harm to the fish, which is a valid concern. But the manner of taking it back might have been abrupt, causing further conflict. The author did apologize, showing they recognized the importance of the brother's feelings. The key here is balancing the responsibility to the fish's well-being versus respecting the brother's wishes. Since the niece was endangering the fish, the author's action was a necessary step to protect the pet, even if it caused temporary tension. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
