My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, I need to go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author gave their niece a fish. The niece was being a bit obnoxious by banging on the tank and throwing a tantrum. The author, wanting to keep their brother's friendship, gave the fish to the brother. But the niece then started shaking the fish in the bag, so the author took it back. The brother was annoyed, the author apologized, and the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to please their brother and avoid conflict. But maybe the way they handled it was problematic. When they gave the fish to the brother, they might have done so without considering the niece's age and maturity. The niece was 13, and her behavior was out of control. The author then took back the fish because the niece was mistreating it. The brother was upset because the author took the fish back, leading to more conflict.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? On one hand, they tried to be generous and maintain the brother's favor. On the other hand, giving a 13-year-old a delicate pet without ensuring she can care for it might be unwise. Also, the author's decision to take the fish back mid-gift could be seen as rude or causing more stress. However, the niece's actions (shaking the bag) were harmful, so the author had a valid reason to protect the fish. But maybe they should have handled it differently, like not giving it to the niece in the first place if she wasn't responsible. Or perhaps they should have talked to the parents first before giving the fish. The brother's reaction might be partly because the author undermined his authority by taking the fish back in front of his family. The author's apology suggests they felt their actions were at least partially wrong. \n\nI think the key points are: did the author wrong by giving a gift without ensuring it would be cared for properly? Maybe. Also, taking the fish back in front of the niece and her parents might have been a breach of respect towards the brother. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the niece's responsibility and caused conflict with the brother. Alternatively, the brother might have been in the wrong for not disciplining his daughter. But the question is about the author. The author's actions led to a rift, even if they apologized. So, answer A.\n"
