My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author gave their niece a pet fish, then took it back. The niece was being disruptive by banging on the tank and throwing a tantrum. The author gave in, gave the fish to the niece, but then the niece shook it, so the author took it back. The brother was annoyed and left, and the author apologized to him. Now the question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about the key points here. The niece was 13, acting out, maybe spoiled. The author's brother had helped them a lot, and the author values their relationship. The fish cost $40, which isn't too expensive, but it's an exotic fish. The author gave the fish to the niece, then took it back when they saw the niece was mishandling it. \n\nThe niece's behavior was problematic\u2014shaking the fish, not respecting it. The author's decision to take it back could be seen as protecting the fish, but maybe they overstepped. However, the niece's actions suggested she didn't care for the fish properly. The author might have felt they gave up too easily when the niece was being destructive.\n\nThe brother's reaction was to tell the author to just give in again to stop the tantrum, but the author thought the niece was spoiled and needed discipline. The author apologized to avoid the relationship with their brother from breaking down, but the question is about whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the niece's actions were not respectful. The author had a right to be concerned about the fish's well-being. However, taking it back might have been a harsh reaction, especially in front of the family. But considering the niece's behavior, maybe the author had a valid reason. The brother's reaction was likely due to the immediate situation of his daughter throwing a tantrum. The author's action to protect the fish is understandable, but perhaps the way they handled it could have been more diplomatic.\n\nI think the key here is the niece's treatment of the fish. The author took it back because the niece was being careless, which is in the fish's best interest. So the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing it with the brother first. However, the situation was tense, and the author acted to protect the fish. The niece's actions were the root issue here. So I think the answer is No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
