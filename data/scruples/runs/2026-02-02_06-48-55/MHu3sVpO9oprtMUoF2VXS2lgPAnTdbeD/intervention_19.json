My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a fish to their niece and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the writer invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. She then had a tantrum wanting a specific fish. The writer gave in and gave the fish to the brother, but the niece shook the bag, leading the writer to take it back. The brother was annoyed, the writer apologized, and now they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the writer make the wrong choice? When the niece was acting out, the writer gave the fish to the brother to calm her down. But then when the niece mishandled it, the writer took it back. The brother felt the writer overreacted and took it personally. \n\nFrom the writer's perspective, they might have felt the niece was being disrespectful to the fish and didn't deserve it. But by giving the fish in the first place without considering if the niece could take care of it, maybe they set up a problem. Also, taking it back in front of the family could have been hurtful to the brother's feelings and the niece's disappointment.\n\nThe brother helped the writer in the past, so maintaining the relationship is important. The writer apologized to keep things good, but maybe there was a better way to handle the situation. For example, not giving the fish in the first place or discussing care responsibilities beforehand. \n\nHowever, the niece's behavior was spoiled, and the writer might have felt the fish wasn't treated properly. The writer's actions were trying to protect the fish and not enable the niece's tantrum. But taking the fish back after giving it might have been a mistake in terms of respecting the brother's wishes and the niece's reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer might be in the wrong for giving the fish impulsively without considering the consequences, leading to the later conflict. But the brother's daughter's actions also contributed. The writer's decision to take back the fish could be seen as necessary but handled poorly, causing the rift. \n\nSo, overall, the writer made a mistake by giving the fish and then taking it back without a better approach. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they gave the fish under pressure from the niece and then reacted impulsively, which strained their relationship despite the apology.\n"
