My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author had their brother and family over for dinner. The brother's daughter started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. She then threw a tantrum, wanting a specific fish. The author gave in and gave the fish to her, but then the niece shook the bag and the author took it back. The brother was upset, and the author apologized later, but the question is whether they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to take back the fish? The fish was in their tank, so it's their property. Giving it away was a generous act to calm the situation. However, when the niece treated the fish poorly, the author's decision to retrieve it might be seen as necessary to protect the animal. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel that once the fish was given, it was no longer the author's to take back. The author's public reprimand of the brother's parenting could have been a factor in the argument. The author apologized to maintain the relationship, which suggests they realized they might have overstepped.\n\nBut the initial action of giving the fish was a gift, which is a personal choice. Taking it back when the recipient is mistreating it is understandable, especially since fish can be harmed by shaking. The author's concern for the fish's well-being is valid. However, the way they handled it\u2014snatching the fish in front of everyone\u2014might have been abrupt and caused more conflict. The brother's reaction could be due to feeling disrespected rather than just about the fish.\n\nConsidering all this, the author acted out of concern for the fish and tried to resolve the situation, but their method might have been hasty. The main issue is whether the author had the right to take back the fish after giving it. Since they owned the fish initially, they could argue it was their choice. However, the brother might have expected the gift to be final. The author's intention was good, but the execution might have been poor, leading to the conflict. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe the situation was mishandled. The answer is B (No), they aren't in the wrong."
