My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who gave their niece a fish and then took it back is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nFirst, the person had their brother and his family over for dinner. The niece was being disruptive by banging on the aquarium, which stressed the fish. Then she threw a tantrum and demanded the white clownfish. The person gave the fish to her, but she shook it too much, so they took it back. The brother was annoyed and the person apologized later, but the author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect for property, the child's behavior, and the brother's reaction. The author gave the fish as a gesture, maybe to placate the child and avoid conflict. But when the child abused the fish, the author took it back. The brother was upset because the author's actions might have upset his daughter and the way they handled it.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel they were protecting their pet. The fish is expensive, and shaking the bag could harm it. The author's action was to stop the fish from being harmed. But the brother felt the author was overstepping, leading to a rift.\n\nBut wait, was the fish a gift? If the author gave it to the brother's family, then the fish technically belonged to them. The author might have overstepped by taking it back. Even if the child was mishandling it, maybe the brother should have been the one to handle disciplining her or ensuring the fish's care. The author's action could be seen as undermining the brother's authority and their family's decision.\n\nAlso, the author had to apologize later, which suggests they felt the conflict wasn't worth the relationship with their brother. The brother might have appreciated the gesture of giving the fish to please his daughter but felt disrespected when it was taken back. The author's comment about the daughter being spoiled might have added to the tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The author had a right to protect their property initially, but once they gave it away, taking it back could be seen as wrong. The brother might have expected the fish to be a gift, so the author's action of retrieving it after giving it might be inconsiderate. However, the child's behavior was problematic, and the author had to act to prevent harm. But maybe the appropriate step was to talk to the parents about the care rather than taking it back in front of everyone.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards the brother's desires and the family dynamics. They might have been in the wrong by taking the fish back after giving it as a gift, leading to conflict with the brother. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's another angle. Maybe the fish wasn't a gift but a loan, but the way it's described as \"giving\" it suggests ownership transferred. Taking it back after giving could be wrong. So, A.\n"
