My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. \n\nSo, the author had their brother and family over for dinner. The brother's daughter, a 13-year-old, was banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. She then had a tantrum, demanding a white clownfish that cost $40. The author gave in and gave the fish to her, but the girl kept shaking the bag, ignored the author's warnings. The author took it back, causing the girl to cry and the brother to be annoyed. The author then apologized to the brother to mend the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author gave the fish to the niece, but when they realized the girl was mishandling it, they took it back. The question is whether taking it back was wrong. \n\nThe author's reasoning was concern for the fish's well-being. The sister-in-law might have wanted the fish for their daughter, but the girl wasn't handling it properly. The author might have overstepped by taking it back without consulting the brother first, but the brother might have expected them to handle the situation differently.\n\nAlso, the brother's reaction was annoyance, and the author apologized to maintain the relationship. The author might have been right to protect the fish, but perhaps the way they handled it could have been better, like talking to the brother first instead of taking action. The author's action could be seen as respecting their own property and the fish's health, but maybe the method was abrupt. However, considering the girl's behavior, the author's concern was valid. The brother's annoyance might stem from feeling the author didn't trust him to discipline his daughter. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, since the author took the fish back without discussing with the brother, it could be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, the girl was clearly mistreating the fish. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The key points are the fish's safety and the relationship with the brother. The author's action was to prevent harm to the fish, which is understandable. However, the way it was done might have been too harsh. But given the circumstances, the author might be justified. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
