My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The niece was being disruptive by banging on the aquarium and throwing a tantrum. The author gave the fish to the niece to stop the crying, but then took it back when the niece was mistreating it. The brother felt the author overreacted and the argument led to the brother leaving. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to give the fish away? The fish was in the author's tank, so giving it to the niece might have been a generous gesture, but the niece didn't own it. When the niece started mistreating it, the author had a valid reason to take it back to protect the fish. However, taking it back might have been abrupt and in front of the niece, causing her to cry again. \n\nAlso, the brother's reaction is important. He felt the author was being too strict. The author's comment about the niece being spoiled might have hurt the brother's feelings. The author did apologize later, which shows they value the relationship. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? On one hand, giving the fish was a kindness, and taking it back was to prevent harm. On the other hand, the way it was handled might have been harsh, especially in front of the niece. The author might have considered discussing the fish's care with the brother before giving it away. But the main issue is the niece's behavior. The author isn't wrong for protecting the fish, but maybe could have handled it more diplomatically. However, given the context, the author's actions were to protect the fish and the relationship. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
