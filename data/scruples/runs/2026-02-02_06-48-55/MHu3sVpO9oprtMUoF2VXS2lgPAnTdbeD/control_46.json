My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author gave a fish to their brother's daughter after she had a tantrum. The fish is expensive, and the niece was shaking the bag, which the author found concerning. The author took the fish back, leading to a conflict with their brother. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe author's actions: Initially giving the fish because the niece was throwing a tantrum and their brother was uncomfortable. Then taking it back when the niece misbehaved further. The author tried to return the fish to their tank to protect it. The brother felt the author was being unreasonable, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nPoints to consider: Was it right to give the fish in the first place? The niece's age and behavior\u2014she's 13, but still a child. The author might have given in to calm the situation. However, taking it back after the niece misbehaved could be seen as overstepping, especially since the fish was already given. The brother might feel the author was making a scene in front of him. On the other hand, the niece's treatment of the fish was reckless, and the author had a right to protect their pet. But once the fish was given, the author might have overstepped by taking it back, causing more conflict. The author's intention was to preserve the relationship with the brother, but their actions might have been impulsive. The key issue is whether the author had the right to take back the fish after giving it as a gift. Gifts typically transfer ownership, so taking it back could be seen as wrong. However, if the fish was a loan or given under specific conditions, that's different. The story doesn't clarify that. The niece's behavior was poor, but the author's reaction might have exacerbated the situation. The brother's annoyance might stem from feeling publicly shamed or embarrassed. The author's apology suggests they realized the relationship was more important than the fish. However, the initial decision to give the fish after the tantrum could be seen as enabling the niece's spoiled behavior. But taking it back in front of her might have caused more harm. This is a bit tricky. The author's actions were motivated by concern for the fish and the brother, but the method might have been wrong. So, the answer might hinge on whether taking back a gift is acceptable. In most cases, once you give a gift, you can't take it back without causing hurt. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking it back after giving it, even if the niece was acting out. However, the niece's behavior was also problematic. The author had to choose between protecting the fish and preserving the relationship. Maybe the right approach would have been to not give the fish in the first place or to talk to the parents privately instead of taking it back publicly. So, considering all that, the author's action of taking back the fish might be seen as the mistake here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
