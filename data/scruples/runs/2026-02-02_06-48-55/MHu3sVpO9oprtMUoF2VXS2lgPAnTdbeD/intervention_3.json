My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The author gave a fish to their niece during a visit, but later took it back after the niece started shaking the bag. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the niece was acting out by banging on the aquarium and throwing a tantrum for the fish. The author, wanting to avoid conflict with their brother and to help the brother's daughter, gave the fish away. However, after the niece started shaking the fish, the author took it back. The brother was upset and felt the author was overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points: The niece's behavior was inappropriate, the author gave the fish to satisfy the niece and possibly the brother, but then took it back when the niece misused it. The brother felt disrespected by the author's comment about the daughter being spoiled, leading to a rift.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as trying to protect the fish and set boundaries, especially after the niece's behavior. However, giving the fish in the first place, even with good intentions, might have set the stage for the conflict. Also, the author's public comment about the niece being spoiled could have hurt the brother's feelings, which is a valid point. \n\nBut considering the niece's actions endangered the fish, the author had a reason to take it back. The brother's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he didn't want the fish to be taken from his daughter. However, the author's primary responsibility isn't to the niece but to their brother's family. Yet, the initial act of giving the fish might have been a mistake, expecting the niece to handle it properly. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for giving the fish in the first place without considering the niece's maturity. But taking it back to prevent harm to the fish was necessary. However, the way the author confronted the brother about the niece being spoiled might have been the real issue here, causing the brother to leave. \n\nOverall, the author's actions were a mix of trying to protect the fish and manage family dynamics. But the initial decision to give the fish without a plan for handling potential misuse could be a misstep. However, the immediate reaction to prevent harm to the fish seems justified. The comment to the brother about the niece's behavior likely exacerbated the conflict. So, while the author's intentions were good, the method might have been flawed. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong in taking back the fish. Since the niece was damaging the fish, taking it back was reasonable. The brother's annoyance might be due to feeling disrespected rather than the action itself. So, the author might not be in the wrong for taking back the fish, but the way they handled the situation with the brother could be a problem. However, the question is specifically about giving and taking back the fish. Given that, the author acted in the fish's best interest after the niece's misconduct. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
