My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for giving their niece a pet fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's niece was being disruptive during dinner. She hit the fish tank, made a tantrum, and wanted a specific fish. The author, wanting to maintain their relationship with their brother, gave the fish to the niece. But when the niece shook the fish bag, the author took it back. This led to tension with the brother.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. Initially, giving the fish might have been a way to stop the tantrum, but taking it back after the niece's behavior could be seen as overreacting. The niece was 13, which is a teen age where they can be very sensitive. The author's brother was uncomfortable and wanted the situation resolved. By taking the fish back, the author might have ignored their brother's feelings, leading to his departure.\n\nThe author apologized later, showing they recognized potential fault in their actions. But the key point is whether they had the right to take the fish back after giving it away. Since the fish was a gift to the niece, taking it back could be seen as undermining the brother's authority and causing further conflict. The niece's behavior, while annoying, might be a cry for attention or a child acting out, which the author didn't address constructively. Instead of taking the fish, maybe a different approach could have been better, like discussing consequences later or working with the parents to set boundaries.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they gave in under pressure, then took it back, which could be seen as inconsistent and disrespectful to their brother's position. The answer would be A.\n"
