My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece, 13, started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. She then had a tantrum demanding a white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but then the niece shook the bag and ignored the author's request to stop. The author took the fish back, leading to an argument with the brother. The brother felt the author was overreacting, and the author apologized to mend the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The niece's behavior was inappropriate. She was being disruptive, causing stress to the fish, and acting out. The author tried to give the fish to the brother to stop the tantrum, but then took it back when the niece was mishandling it. The author's main concern was the fish's well-being. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as overstepping if they didn't own the fish. If the fish was the author's property, giving it away and then taking it back could be controversial. However, the niece was clearly not respecting the fish, and the author had to protect their possession. The brother might feel the author was too controlling, especially since he wanted to give the fish to his daughter. But the author's justification was protecting the fish from harm. \n\nAlso, the author apologized to preserve the relationship, indicating they value the bond with their brother. The brother's reaction might be more about not wanting to disappoint his daughter. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in response to the niece's behavior. They had a right to protect their property and the fish's welfare. However, giving the fish away might have been a mistake, but taking it back after the niece abused it was reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong here because they acted in the fish's best interest and tried to resolve the situation by apologizing. The brother's daughter's actions were the root problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
