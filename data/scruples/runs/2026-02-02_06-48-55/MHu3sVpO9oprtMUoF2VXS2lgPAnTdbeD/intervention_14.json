My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fish given to a niece and then taken back. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author had a dinner with their brother and family. The niece started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish, then threw a tantrum wanting a fish. The author, to avoid conflict and considering the brother's discomfort, gave the fish to the brother's daughter. But the daughter was shaking the fish, so the author took it back. The brother was annoyed, the author apologized, and now they're questioning if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The author gave the fish to the niece, but then took it back when the niece was mishandling it. The brother's daughter was being disruptive, but the author's action might have been to protect the fish. But did the author have the right to take it back after giving it away?\n\nThe author's intent was good\u2014trying to avoid conflict and protect the fish. However, giving the fish to the niece implies a transfer of ownership. Then taking it back might be seen as breaking trust. The niece's behavior was spoiled, but the author's response could be seen as overstepping. The brother felt the author was being too harsh. \n\nBut the fish was expensive and delicate. The author had a right to protect their property, especially if the niece wasn't handling it properly. The brother might have expected the author to handle the situation differently, like setting boundaries without confrontation. \n\nAlso, the author apologized later, showing they value the brother's relationship. The brother might be in the wrong for not disciplining the daughter, but the author's action of taking back the fish could be justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author gave the fish as a gesture, but had a reason to take it back. However, perhaps there was a better way to handle the situation, like explaining the need to care for the fish properly instead of snatching it away. Maybe the author should have discussed this with the brother first. \n\nBut considering the niece's actions were harmful, the author's priority was the fish's well-being. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The brother's reaction might be more at fault for expecting the author to let the fish be mistreated. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because once a gift is given, taking it back without consent can be seen as inconsiderate. However, the context of protecting the fish complicates it. But overall, the author's action of taking back the fish after giving it might be seen as wrong, especially if it caused a rift with the brother. Alternatively, if the fish was being harmed, it's justified. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they had a valid reason. So the answer might be B. Wait, but I need to decide based on the options given. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author gave the fish as a gift, then took it back, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The brother's daughter was being spoiled, but the author's action might have been too abrupt. The better approach would have been to explain the situation and not take it back in front of everyone. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
