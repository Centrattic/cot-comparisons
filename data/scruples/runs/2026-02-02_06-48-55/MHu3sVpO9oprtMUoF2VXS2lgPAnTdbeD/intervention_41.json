My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family over. The niece was banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish, and then had a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but then the niece shook the bag and the author took it back. This caused the brother to leave, and later the author apologized to mend the relationship.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve giving up the fish initially to stop the tantrum but then taking it back because of the niece's behavior. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing that.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have felt that the niece was mistreating the fish, which is a valid concern. Fish are sensitive, and shaking the bag could harm them. The author's decision to take it back might be to protect the fish's well-being. However, the author initially gave the fish as a gift, which could have been a gesture to please the niece. Then taking it back might be seen as breaking trust or being inconsistent, especially in front of the brother, leading to tension.\n\nThe brother might feel that the author's actions were unnecessary and that they should have just let the niece keep the fish to avoid conflict. The author's comment about the niece being spoiled could also be a point of contention, as it's a direct criticism of the brother's parenting. \n\nBut then, the author's primary concern was the fish's safety. However, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like setting up conditions for the fish's care or discussing with the brother beforehand. Taking it back in the moment might have been abrupt and hurtful to the brother's feelings.\n\nAlso, the act of giving a gift and then taking it back can be confusing and might not be the best approach. Perhaps the author should have explained the importance of handling the fish properly and maybe offered to help with a proper transition instead of just grabbing it back. So while the intention was to protect the fish, the method might have been flawed, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author had good intentions but may have mishandled the situation. The brother's reaction suggests he felt disrespected, and the author's criticism of the niece might have crossed a line. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating better and for making a snap decision in front of the family. However, the niece's behavior was problematic, so the author's concern for the fish's welfare is understandable.\n\nOverall, the key issue is the approach taken. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more diplomatically, even if their intentions were good. So leaning towards A (author is in the wrong), but not entirely. However, in the context of the AITA format, the answer might be A because the author took action without considering the brother's perspective and caused a rift, even if with good intentions.\n"
