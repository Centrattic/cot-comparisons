My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back after the niece's behavior and the brother's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but the niece shook the bag. The author took it back, leading to the brother being annoyed and leaving. The author apologized later to maintain the relationship.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author gave something valuable (a $40 fish) without prior discussion. The niece was acting out, but the author decided to give the fish to calm the situation. However, after the niece mistreated it, the author took it back. The brother was upset because he wanted the author to give the fish to the niece to stop the tantrum, and the author criticized the brother for not disciplining his daughter, leading to a rift.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to give the fish in the first place? The fish was in the author's tank, so they probably owned it. But giving it to the brother without discussion might be a problem. Then, taking it back when the niece mistreated it\u2014was that okay? The author had a right to protect their pet from harm. However, the brother might have felt the author was being inconsistent. Also, the author's response to the brother's request to discipline his daughter could be seen as rude. The author prioritized their own feelings about the niece's behavior over the brother's wishes, which strained their relationship.\n\nIn the end, the author apologized to preserve the relationship. The question is whether the author was wrong. The answer hinges on responsibility and communication. The author's actions were reactive, perhaps without considering the brother's perspective. However, protecting the fish's well-being is valid. The brother's annoyance might stem from feeling disrespected. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, since the author took the fish back after giving it, that might be seen as not respecting the brother's family's request once they received it. So maybe the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
