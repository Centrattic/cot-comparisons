My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. Let's start by looking at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a fish tank and invited their brother and family over. The niece started banging on the tank, which stressed the fish. Then she had a tantrum demanding the white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the niece, but then saw her shaking the bag and decided to take it back. This led to an argument with the brother, and eventually the author apologized to the brother to mend their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The fish was part of the author's aquarium. The niece's behavior was disruptive, and the author gave the fish as a compromise. But when the niece started shaking the bag, the author took it back, which might have been a mistake. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to take back the fish after giving it away? The initial giving was a response to the niece's tantrum, possibly under pressure. However, once the fish was given to the brother, it might be considered a gift, even if the niece was acting out. The author's decision to take it back could be seen as breaking trust with the brother and the niece, especially since the brother didn't want a problem over a \"stupid fish.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the niece's actions (shaking the bag) were harmful to the fish, and the author might have a responsibility to protect their pets. But the author's method of taking back the fish in front of everyone might have been abrupt and hurtful. \n\nThe author apologized, indicating they realized that mending the relationship was more important than the fish. However, the initial act of taking back the fish might have been justified due to the niece's treatment of the fish. But giving something away and then taking it back can be confusing and hurtful, especially in front of the family. \n\nThe brother's annoyance might stem from the disruption and the author's interference. The author's comment about the niece being spoiled could have been perceived as blaming the brother's parenting, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions led to conflict, even though their intention was to protect the fish. The decision to take back the fish might not be entirely wrong, but the way it was handled could have been better. However, the main issue is whether the author had the right to take back a gift they gave. Since the fish was given to the brother's daughter, taking it back without consulting the brother might be wrong. So, the author might be partially at fault for not considering the brother's feelings and the family dynamics more carefully.\n"
