My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the author gave the fish to their niece after she threw a tantrum. The fish was expensive, and the niece's behavior was disruptive. The author tried to give the fish to calm her down, which worked initially. But then the niece started shaking the bag, which the author saw as cruel. So they took the fish back.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, they gave the fish in the moment to stop the tantrum. Maybe they should have thought about the consequences, like the niece treating the fish poorly. But the niece's actions after receiving the fish were out of their control. The author took back the fish to protect it, which could be seen as responsible. However, doing so publicly might have escalated things. \n\nThe brother's reaction was also important. He felt the author was overreacting, leading to a rift. The author apologized to preserve the relationship with the brother, which shows they valued the brother's feelings. But maybe the author should have communicated better with the brother before taking the fish back. \n\nOn the other hand, the niece's behavior was inconsiderate. The author had a right to protect their pet. The fish was their property, and they had the right to take it back if they felt it was being mishandled. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a mix of good intentions and maybe impulsive decisions. But considering the niece's actions, taking the fish back wasn't entirely wrong. The key points are the niece's behavior and the author's responsibility to their pet. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
