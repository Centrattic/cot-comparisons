My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about giving a pet fish to the niece and then taking it back. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's brother and his family were over for dinner. The niece started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum asking for the white clownfish, which costs $40. The author tried to comfort her but she kept fussing. The author, considering the brother's discomfort, gave the fish to him. The niece then shook the bag, ignored the author's request to stop, leading the author to take the fish back. This caused the brother to be annoyed, and they had an argument, leading to the brother leaving. The author apologized later to maintain the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were trying to be accommodating, giving the fish to the brother to stop the niece's tantrum. However, when the niece mishandled the fish, the author took it back to prevent harm. The author's intention was to protect the fish from being killed by the niece's actions. The author also apologized later to preserve the relationship with the brother.\n\nFrom the brother's perspective: He might feel that the author was being inconsistent\u2014first giving the fish, then taking it back, causing more distress. The brother might have wanted to just give the fish to the niece to stop the tantrum, and the author's interference might have been seen as undermining his parenting or not respecting his decision.\n\nLegal or ethical considerations: The fish was the author's property. Giving it to the brother as a gift might be okay, but taking it back from the niece could be seen as a breach of trust if the brother expected the fish to stay with them. However, the author had a valid concern about the fish's well-being due to the niece's actions. The author's main issue was with the niece's behavior, not the brother's, but the confrontation with the brother escalated the situation.\n\nPossible points of contention: The author didn't consult the brother before taking back the fish, which might have been a mistake. Also, telling the brother his daughter was spoiled could have been hurtful. However, the author's intent was to protect the fish, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were acting to protect their property and the fish's safety. However, the way they handled the situation could have been better, like discussing with the brother first. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the brother's feelings and the relationship, the author did apologize, which suggests they didn't intend harm. The main conflict was the niece's behavior and the author's reaction to protect the fish. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
