My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nSo, the author invited their brother and his family over. The niece started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but the niece shook the bag and the author took it back. The brother was annoyed, the author apologized later, and now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the ownership of the fish. The author owned the fish, right? They had the tank and the fish was part of their personal collection. The niece didn't own it. So when the author gave the fish to the brother, maybe as a gift to the niece, that's one action. But then taking it back because of the niece's behavior\u2014was that right?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the niece was being deliberately cruel, shaking the bag, so taking the fish back was to protect it. But from the brother's side, he might feel that the author broke a promise, causing more conflict and making his daughter upset again. The author apologized to the brother to save their relationship, which shows they value their bond with the brother over the niece's behavior.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let's consider ownership. The author's property was taken by the niece inappropriately, but the author gave it to the brother first. Maybe the brother didn't realize the fish was a gift to his daughter, or maybe he thought the author was giving it to him. The author then took it back, which might have embarrassed the brother in front of his family. That could be why the brother was annoyed.\n\nLegally, the author owns the fish. But socially, giving a gift to a child and then taking it back might be seen as inconsistent. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the brother's authority, especially if he expected the fish to stay with his daughter. Also, the author made a comment about the daughter being spoiled, which might have hurt the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the niece's behavior was problematic. The author had a right to protect their fish. But maybe the better approach would have been to give the fish as a gift with conditions, or to explain why it can't be taken. Alternatively, the author could have said no initially, or discussed with the brother before giving it away.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did give the fish to the brother, perhaps without a clear agreement. Then taking it back might have been a breach of that gesture, even if it was due to the niece's actions. The brother might have felt that the author was being capricious. So the author's actions, while understandable in wanting to protect the fish, might have been socially inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo overall, the author might be in the wrong because they gave a gift and then took it back without considering the social implications on their brother's side. The brother's annoyance was probably due to the author's actions undermining his position with his daughter. Even if the niece was misbehaving, the author's comment about her being spoiled could have been hurtful. The author's apology suggests they recognized some fault, but the initial decision to take back the fish after giving it might still be seen as the wrong move.\n"
