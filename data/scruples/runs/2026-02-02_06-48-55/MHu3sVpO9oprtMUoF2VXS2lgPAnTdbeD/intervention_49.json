My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and his family for dinner. The niece started acting out by banging on the fish tank, threw a tantrum, and wanted the white clownfish. The author, wanting to avoid conflict with their brother, gave the fish to the niece. However, the niece shook the bag, and the author took it back, leading to more conflict and the brother feeling annoyed. They apologized later to mend the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. Giving a $40 fish as a spontaneous gift might not be a problem, but taking it back after the niece mistreated it could be an issue. The author's main motivation was to protect the fish, which is understandable. However, giving the fish to the niece without consulting the brother might have been a mistake, especially since the brother might not have been prepared to take care of it. Also, the author's public confrontation about the daughter being spoiled could have hurt the brother's feelings, leading to tension.\n\nBut the niece's behavior was inappropriate, and the author had a right to be concerned about the fish's welfare. The brother's reaction might have been defensive, not just about the fish. The author's apology after shows they value the relationship, which is a positive step.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The initial giving was a gesture, but taking it back was necessary for the fish's safety. The brother's responsibility to discipline his daughter also plays a role here. Both sides might have overreacted. The author tried to maintain the relationship by apologizing, which is mature. So maybe they're not in the wrong entirely. Hmm, but giving a pet without the owner's consent could be an issue. Wait, the author gave the fish to the niece, but the brother might have felt it was his responsibility to handle the situation. However, the author had the right to protect their property and the fish's well-being. \n\nI think the author's actions were justified in the moment, especially considering the fish's safety and the niece's behavior. The brother's annoyance was more about his daughter's behavior and the author's comment about her being spoiled. The author tried to resolve the conflict by apologizing, which is a good sign. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
