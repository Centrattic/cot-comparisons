My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and his family for dinner. The brother's daughter started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. Then she threw a tantrum, demanding the white clownfish. The author gave in, gave the fish to the brother, but then took it back when the niece was shaking the bag. The brother got annoyed, and the author apologized later but is now unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author gave the fish to the brother, probably thinking it was the right thing to do to stop the tantrum. But then took it back because they thought the niece was harming the fish. The brother felt it was a stupid fish and didn't want the author to make a big deal out of it. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they did the right thing by protecting the fish. But when they took it back, the brother's feelings were hurt. The niece was acting out, but the author's response might have been too abrupt. However, the author's intention was to save the fish. \n\nThe brother's daughter was being difficult, but the author might have handled it differently, maybe by talking to the parents first instead of giving and then taking back. The brother might have felt disrespected, but the author was trying to protect the fish. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they gave the fish as a gift but then took it back without consulting the brother again. That could be seen as undermining the brother's authority or not respecting his family's needs. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason to protect the fish. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in terms of the relationship, the author did apologize and wanted to maintain the bond with the brother. The main issue is whether taking back the fish was justified. If the author had explained their concerns to the brother first, maybe they could have worked it out. But taking it back without discussion might have been hurtful. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer would be B (No), but there are nuances. However, since the options are A (Yes) or B (No), and considering that the author's action was to protect the fish, it's more about whether the method was wrong. Since the author's intention was good, even if the method could have been better, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
