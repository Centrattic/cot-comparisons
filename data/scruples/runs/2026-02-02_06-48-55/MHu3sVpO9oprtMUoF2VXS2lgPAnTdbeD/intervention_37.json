My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The story is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. The author did this because the niece was being difficult and shaking the fish bag, and they felt she was spoilt. The brother was upset, and the author later apologized.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's consider the points from the story.\n\nThe niece was banging on the fish tank, causing stress to the fish. Then she threw a tantrum wanting the fish. The author gave it to her, but the niece shook the bag, and the author took it back. The brother was uncomfortable and told the author to just give it up. The author then accused the brother of spoiling his daughter, leading to the brother leaving. The author apologized two days later to mend the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to give the fish back after giving it? Was their reaction to the niece's behavior reasonable? And how did their actions affect their brother's feelings?\n\nWhen the author gave the fish to the niece, it became her possession, right? Unless there was a prior agreement that the fish would stay in the author's care. The author might have given it as a gift, which means the niece's family now owns it. Then taking it back could be seen as taking a gift back, which is generally not polite. The author might have overstepped by taking the fish back after giving it away, especially in front of the niece and without consulting the brother.\n\nAlso, the niece's behavior was certainly poor. Shaking the fish bag could harm the fish, but the author's response was to snatch it back. However, the author should have considered that once a gift is given, it's the recipient's responsibility. The author might have felt disrespected by the niece's actions, but taking the fish back publicly could be seen as embarrassing the daughter and possibly the brother.\n\nThe brother was in a difficult position, trying to manage his daughter's tantrum. The author's accusation that the brother was spoiling the daughter might have been harsh, especially in front of the family. The author's actions, while stemming from concern for the fish, might have been tactless and caused unnecessary conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had good intentions in trying to protect the fish and prevent harm. However, the method of taking it back might not have been the best approach. Maybe a better approach would have been to explain the importance of handling the fish gently and involve the brother in setting boundaries for the niece.\n\nIn terms of the relationship with the brother, the author apologized, which is a positive step. But the initial action of taking back the fish could have been seen as undermining the brother's authority or disrespecting his family. The brother's reaction of calling the fish \"stupid\" and urging the author to just give it up might indicate frustration, but the author's response about the daughter being spoiled could have been a direct hit to his parenting style.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of concern for the fish, might have been inconsiderate of the brother's feelings and the dynamics within the brother's household. Taking the fish back after giving it as a gift without discussion could be seen as the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
