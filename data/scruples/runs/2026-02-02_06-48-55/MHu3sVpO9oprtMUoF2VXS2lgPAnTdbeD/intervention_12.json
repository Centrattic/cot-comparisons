My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves their niece getting a fish, then taking it back. So the main points here are about giving the fish as a gesture, then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the author gives the fish to the niece after she throws a tantrum. But then they take it back when the niece is being careless with it. The brother is upset because the author took the fish back, leading to a rift. The author apologized because they didn't want the relationship with their brother to get damaged.\n\nSo, the key elements here are: the niece's behavior, the author's decision to give the fish back, and then taking it back. The author might have overstepped by taking the fish back without consulting the brother. They might have thought they were acting in the fish's best interest, but it came off as undermining the brother's parenting. The brother felt the author was being controlling, which could be valid. On the other hand, the niece was being inconsiderate. But the author's approach might not have been the best. Instead of taking it back, maybe they should have discussed it with the brother first or found another way to handle the niece's behavior. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not respecting the brother's parental authority. But the niece's actions were also problematic. The answer might be a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that they took the fish back without the brother's consent, leading to the argument, I think the author made a mistake. So the answer would be A.\n"
