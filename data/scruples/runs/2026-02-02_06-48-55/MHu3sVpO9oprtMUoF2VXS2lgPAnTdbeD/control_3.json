My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a conflict between the author and their brother over a fish given to the niece.\n\nFirst, the author gave the fish to the niece to stop her tantrum. The niece then handled the fish roughly, which the author found concerning. The author took the fish back, leading to more conflict with the brother. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Fish**: The author had the fish in their tank. Giving it away might be a personal decision, but once given, it's the recipient's responsibility. However, taking it back after giving it could be problematic.\n\n2. **The Niece's Behavior**: The niece was being disruptive, yelling, and shaking the fish bag. The author's concern about her treatment of the fish is valid, as sudden movements can stress or harm fish.\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: The author's comment about the niece being \"spoiled\" might have been hurtful to the brother, leading him to feel personally attacked. The brother's response of calling the fish \"stupid\" could also be seen as dismissive of the author's concerns.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution**: The author apologized to the brother to maintain the relationship, which shows they value the bond. However, the initial action of taking back the fish might have been abrupt and not discussed with the brother first.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author have the right to take back the fish after giving it? Was the comment about the niece crossing a line? The brother's reaction might be protective of his child, while the author was concerned for the fish's well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, intent and consequences matter. The author's main issue was trying to protect the fish from harm, which is understandable. However, the method (taking it back without a clear discussion) might have contributed to the conflict. The brother might feel that the author undermined his parenting by calling the child spoiled.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author acted on concern for the fish but might have handled it differently. The comment about the niece could have been unkind. So maybe AITA is yes (A). Alternatively, if the brother overreacted, maybe not. But given the situation, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of the brother's feelings.\n"
