My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back after some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece was banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish, then had a tantrum wanting a specific fish. The author, possibly to avoid conflict and because their brother was uncomfortable, gave the fish to the brother. The niece then shook the fish, leading the author to take it back, causing more upset and a fallout with the brother.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author was wrong. The key points here are the author's intentions and actions. The author might have given in to keep the peace, but then took it back when they felt the niece was mistreating it. The brother's reaction was annoyed, and the author's comment about the niece being spoiled might have been a misstep.\n\nOn one hand, maybe the author had the right to protect their fish, especially if the niece was handling it carelessly. On the other, giving the fish initially without proper consideration of how it would be handled might have been a mistake. Also, the author's comment to the brother about the child being spoiled could have been insensitive, leading to the argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author took back the fish because they were concerned for the pet's well-being, that's a valid reason. However, the initial giving of the fish without ensuring it would be properly cared for might have been hasty. The way the author confronted the brother about the child's behavior could have been a misstep, causing the brother to feel attacked.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong since they had good intentions to protect the fish. However, perhaps they could have handled the situation more diplomatically, like discussing with the brother first before taking the fish back. The argument might have been avoided if the author had communicated better. But the core issue is the care of the fish. If the niece was mistreating it, the author had a right to intervene. The AITA often hinges on intentions and context. The author's apology helped mend the relationship, which is a positive step. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there are lessons to be learned about communication and handling sensitive situations.\n"
