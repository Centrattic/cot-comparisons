My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves giving a pet fish to the niece and then taking it back. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author invites their brother and family over for dinner. The brother's daughter starts banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish. Then she throws a tantrum demanding the white clownfish. The author gives in and gives the fish to the brother, but then the niece starts shaking the bag, which the author thinks is intentional. The author takes the fish back, leading to the niece crying and the brother being annoyed. The author apologizes later to mend the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the actions taken and the motivations. The author gave the fish as a way to stop the tantrum, but then took it back because of the niece's behavior. Was it wrong to give the fish in the first place? Well, the fish was expensive, but the author had a good relationship with the brother and wanted to help. However, the niece's treatment of the fish might be a problem. \n\nBut then, by taking the fish back, the author might have crossed a line. The brother might have thought he had accepted the fish as a gift. The author's action of snatching it back could have been hurtful to the brother's feelings, especially since he was trying to manage his daughter's excitement. The author's comment about the daughter being spoiled might have been the bigger issue, leading the brother to leave. \n\nThe author apologized, which shows they care about the relationship. However, the initial decision to give the fish might not have been wrong since it was to ease the situation. But taking it back after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate. The brother might have felt the author was being inconsistent or not respecting their family's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions in taking the fish back might have been unnecessary and caused more harm. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not fully considering the brother's perspective after giving the gift.\n"
