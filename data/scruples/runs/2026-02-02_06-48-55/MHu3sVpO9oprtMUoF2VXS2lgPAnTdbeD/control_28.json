My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the author had a dinner with their brother and his family. The niece was throwing a tantrum over a fish. The author gave the fish as a way to stop the tantrum. Then the niece was being careless with the fish, so the author took it back. The brother was annoyed and left, but the author apologized to maintain the relationship.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author gave the fish to appease the niece and prevent her tantrum, which might be seen as giving in to a child's behavior. However, the niece was being careless with the fish, shaking it, which could harm it. The author took it back to protect the fish, which could be justified. \n\nBut the author's brother was upset, and the author apologized to mend the relationship. The author's actions were to protect the fish and maybe avoid spoiling the niece. But giving the fish might have been a mistake because the niece wasn't handling it properly. The author's brother might feel disrespected or that their child was being criticized when the author said she was spoiled.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author had good intentions but might have overstepped by taking the fish back after giving it, leading to tension. However, the niece's behavior was problematic. The author's main goal was to maintain their brother's friendship, which they did by apologizing. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's actions were to protect the fish and address the niece's behavior, even though it caused a conflict. The brother's reaction might be excessive, and the author's apology shows they care about the relationship.\n"
