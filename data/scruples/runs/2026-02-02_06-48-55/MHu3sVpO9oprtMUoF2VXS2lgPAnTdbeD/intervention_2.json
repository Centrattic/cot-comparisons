My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a fish tank and gave a fish to their niece after she had a tantrum. Then they took it back because the niece was shaking the bag, leading to a conflict with their brother.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author gave the fish as a gesture, probably to please their niece and ease the situation. But when the niece started shaking the fish, the author took it back. The brother was upset because the author didn't let the niece keep it, leading to a fallout. The author then apologized to the brother to maintain their relationship.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, the author's actions might be seen as inconsistent. Giving and then taking back the fish could be confusing for the niece and might not teach her responsibility. Also, the author's decision to take back the fish was based on their concern for the fish's well-being, which is valid. However, the way it was handled might have been harsh, especially since the brother might have expected the fish to stay with the niece once given.\n\nBut wait, the author gave the fish because they felt pressured by the niece's tantrum and their brother's discomfort. The niece's behavior was problematic, and the author's initial intent was to calm the situation. However, taking back the fish after giving it might have been a mistake in terms of setting boundaries and consistency. The niece might have felt betrayed, and the brother might have felt the author was undermining his parenting.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the niece being \"spoiled rotten\" could have been hurtful to the brother's feelings, contributing to the argument. The author did apologize later, showing they value the relationship with their brother.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of both. The author acted in the moment to protect the fish but might have overreacted by taking it back after giving it away. The brother's side is also valid because he wanted to end the tantrum. So, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not following through on the gift once given, leading to confusion and conflict. However, their concern for the fish's safety is understandable.\n\nI think the key point is that once a gift is given, taking it back can be problematic. The author's decision to do so disrupted the situation and might have been unnecessary. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, led to conflict and inconsistency. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
