My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about giving a niece a pet fish and then taking it back. The author had a dinner with their brother's family, and during the visit, the niece started acting out by banging on the fish tank and having a tantrum to get a specific fish. The author then gave the fish to the brother's family, but the niece was mishandling it, so the author took it back, which led to tension with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. From the author's side, they value their brother's friendship a lot and didn't want to lose it over the niece's behavior. They gave in to the niece's demands to stop the tantrum but then felt the niece was being careless, so they took the fish back. They apologized to the brother to mend the relationship.\n\nOn the other side, the brother might feel that the author overstepped by taking the fish back after giving it. The niece was excited and perhaps acting out of immaturity, but the father might have felt the author was being too controlling or not respecting their parenting. The brother's annoyance could stem from feeling his daughter's happiness was prioritized over the author's actions.\n\nThe key points here are: the author gave the fish as a gesture to calm the situation, then took it back due to mishandling, leading to conflict. The author's intention was to protect the fish and their relationship with the brother. However, by taking the fish back, they might have disregarded the brother's wishes and possibly made the brother feel disrespected.\n\nI need to think about whether the author had the right to take the fish back. Once given as a gift, the ownership might be considered transferred, so taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the niece was damaging the fish, and the author had a right to protect their property. But since the fish was already given, maybe the author should have discussed it with the brother first instead of taking it back.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the niece being spoiled might have been hurtful to the brother, contributing to his annoyance. The brother might feel that the author is criticizing his parenting, which is a sensitive topic. The author's apology suggests they realized this might have been an issue.\n\nSo, the author's actions were motivated by trying to protect the fish and their relationship, but the method of taking the fish back without discussing it with the brother might have been the problem. The author could have handled it differently, perhaps by talking to the brother first about the niece's treatment of the fish instead of taking it back on the spot. This might have avoided the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were good, but their actions may have been inconsiderate of the brother's feelings and the dynamics of gift-giving. Therefore, the author might be at least partially at fault for not handling the situation more diplomatically.\n"
