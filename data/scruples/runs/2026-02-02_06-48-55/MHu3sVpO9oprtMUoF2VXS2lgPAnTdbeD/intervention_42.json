My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about giving a pet fish to the niece and then taking it back. The author had a dinner with their brother's family. The niece was being really disruptive, banging on the aquarium, causing stress to the fish. Then she had a tantrum wanting the white clownfish. The author gave the fish to the brother, but the niece then shook the bag, ignored the author's warning, leading the author to take the fish back. The brother got annoyed, and they had a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author gave the fish to the brother's family, which the niece then started to mishandle. The author took it back, which caused the brother to leave. The key points here are: was the fish a gift to the niece, or was it given to the brother? The author gave it to the brother, but the niece then took over. The author's action of taking the fish back might have been impulsive. The brother might have felt that the fish was now his family's to handle, so the author overstepping by taking it back could be an issue. Also, the author's response to the brother telling him to discipline his daughter might have been harsh, leading to the argument. The author apologized later, but the question is whether they were in the wrong. The niece's behavior was problematic, but the author's actions might have been a reaction to that. However, the fish was given to the brother, so taking it back without his consent could be seen as wrong. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they gave the fish away and then took it back, possibly without the brother's agreement. Alternatively, if the fish was given with the understanding it was for the niece, then maybe it's different. But the brother's reaction to the author's comment about disciplining the daughter also contributes. It's a bit of a complex situation, but the main issue is the author taking back the fish after giving it away. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
