My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece, then taking it back. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is at fault.\n\nFirst, let me recap the story. The author has a good relationship with their brother and invites him and his family over for dinner. During dinner, the brother's daughter (the author's niece) starts banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. She then throws a tantrum and wants the white clownfish, which is expensive. The author gives in and gives the fish to her, but when the niece starts shaking the bag, the author takes it back. The brother gets annoyed, the author apologizes later, but there's tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the possible angles here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They might feel that the niece was being inconsiderate, hurting the fish by shaking the bag. They might have felt that the niece was spoiled, hence their comment to the brother. The author might believe they acted in the fish's best interest when taking it back. Also, they apologized to the brother to maintain the relationship, showing they value the brother's friendship.\n\nFrom the brother's perspective: He might feel that the author overstepped by taking back the fish, especially since the niece was excited and just wanted the fish to stop the tantrum. The brother might see the comment about the niece being spoiled as an insult. The author's action might have caused unnecessary conflict during the visit.\n\nEthically, giving the fish was a gift, but taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust. The niece didn't own the fish initially, so the author had the right to take it back, but maybe they should have handled it differently. The way the author gave the fish\u2014perhaps without prior agreement\u2014might have set up a situation where taking it back was problematic. Also, the author's public comment about the niece being spoiled could have been hurtful.\n\nAnother point: The author gave the fish as a gift to stop the tantrum, which is common in parenting to calm a child. But taking it back after the fact might have been confusing or hurt the child's feelings. The brother might have felt the author was undermining his parenting by taking the fish and making a comment about discipline.\n\nBut the author's concern about the fish's well-being is valid. If the niece was shaking the bag, that's dangerous for the fish. So there's a conflict between the child's immediate desires and the animal's welfare.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe the author wasn't wrong, but there are aspects where they could have handled it better. For example, maybe discussing the fish's ownership beforehand, or finding a middle ground instead of taking it back abruptly. However, the brother's reaction might also be harsh, especially if the author's action was to protect the fish.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to take back a gift they gave? Was the comment about the niece being spoiled uncalled for? Was the way the author handled the situation respectful enough?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether giving the fish was a final decision. If the author gave it as a gift, taking it back could be seen as a breach. However, if the fish was on loan or given with conditions, maybe not. The story doesn't clarify if the fish was a permanent gift or a temporary handover. The author might have thought they could take it back if it was being mishandled, but the brother might feel ownership after receiving it.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the niece being spoiled might have been a direct cause of the brother's anger. The author's intention was to protect the fish and possibly teach the niece about responsibility, but the method might have been poor.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to protect the fish, but their handling of the situation, especially the public criticism of the niece and the abrupt taking back of the fish, could have been done better. However, the brother's reaction to the comment and the subsequent fallout might also be his fault. The answer might be a mix of both sides, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often judges based on the actions causing harm without sufficient reason.\n\nGiven that, the author gave the fish to stop the tantrum, which is a common tactic, but then took it back, which the brother might see as undermining his authority and the child's expectation. The author's comment about the niece being spoiled is likely a major point against them. So, the author might be at fault for the comment and the way they took back the fish without considering the brother's feelings and the child's perspective.\n"
