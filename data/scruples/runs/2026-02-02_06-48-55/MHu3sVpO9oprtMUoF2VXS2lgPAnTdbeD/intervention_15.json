My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. The author had a nice dinner with their brother and his family. During the visit, the niece starts messing with the fish tank, causing stress to the fish. She then throws a tantrum demanding the fish. The author gives in and gives the fish to her, but when the niece shakes the bag, the author takes it back, leading to a conflict with the brother.\n\nFirst, the author gave the fish as a gift, which is a generous act. But then, when the niece mishandles it, the author takes it back. The question is whether this action was wrong. On one hand, the niece is a child, and maybe the author shouldn't have given her the fish in the first place if they knew she'd handle it poorly. Also, taking back a gift after giving it might not be the best approach, especially in front of the parents. The brother might feel embarrassed or that the author is being inconsistent, which could strain their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fish is an exotic pet that costs money, and the author might be justified in wanting to protect their property. The niece's behavior was problematic, shaking the bag and not caring about the fish's well-being. The author's concern for the fish's safety is valid. However, the way they handled it\u2014snatching the fish back in front of everyone\u2014might have been inconsiderate of the brother's feelings and the niece's emotions.\n\nThe key points here are the initial giving of the fish as a gift and then taking it back. Gifts are usually meant to be given freely, and retracting them can cause embarrassment or resentment. The author's intention was to make the niece happy, but the subsequent action might have been too abrupt. The brother's reaction suggests that he felt the author was overreacting, which led to the argument.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for giving the fish and then taking it back, causing conflict. However, the niece's behavior was also problematic. But since the author is the one who initiated the action of taking back the gift, which can be seen as breaking a trust or causing public embarrassment, they might bear more responsibility here. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
