My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece started banging on the aquarium, stressing the fish, then had a tantrum demanding the white clownfish. The author gave in and gave the fish to the brother, but then the niece shook the bag, so the author took it back. The brother got annoyed and left, and the author apologized later.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about ownership and responsibility. The author owned the fish originally. The niece's behavior was inappropriate, but the author gave the fish to the brother. Then, the niece's actions (shaking the bag) led the author to take it back. Was it wrong to take it back?\n\nWell, the fish was given to the brother's family, so once given, it's their responsibility. If the child was mishandling it, maybe the author had a right to intervene to protect the fish. But maybe the author should have discussed it with the brother first instead of taking the fish back. That could have caused the brother's annoyance. \n\nThe brother might have felt that the author broke trust by taking back the gift. The author's action could have been seen as undermining the brother's authority. However, the author's concern was the fish's well-being. There's a balance between respecting the brother's family and protecting the animal. \n\nBut the author did apologize and wanted to maintain the relationship, so maybe they acted out of concern. However, giving the fish away and then taking it back might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like not giving the fish in the first place or addressing the niece's behavior without removing the fish. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the niece's behavior was problematic, but the author's actions could have been handled better. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue both sides. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author took the fish back without consulting the brother, which might have been disrespectful, but the intention was to save the fish. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author apologized and the brother's annoyance was from feeling disrespected, maybe the author did have some responsibility in how they handled the situation. So, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's intentions were to protect the fish and the relationship was mended through apology. But there's a case for A as well. Hmm.\n"
