My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. The situation involves a family dinner where the niece acted out, leading to the uncle giving her the fish but then taking it back when she mistreated it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle gave the fish as a gift to calm the niece's tantrum. However, when the niece started shaking the bag, he took it back. The key points here are intent, the value of the fish, and the relationships involved. \n\nThe uncle initially gave the fish to stop the tantrum and to be kind. But when he saw the niece mistreating the fish, he took it back to protect the fish's well-being. The niece's father, the brother, was annoyed and wanted the uncle to just let it go. The uncle then stood his ground about disciplining the niece, leading to a rift.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the uncle's decision to take back the fish might be seen as protecting the animal from harm. However, the way he did it could have been handled more sensitively. The uncle's main issue was the niece's behavior and his concern for the fish. But by doing this publicly, it might have embarrassed the niece and upset the brother. \n\nThe uncle did apologize later to preserve the relationship, which shows he valued his bond with his brother more than the fish. However, the initial action of giving the fish and then taking it back could be seen as inconsistent. The uncle might have been wrong in not considering the brother's perspective fully, especially since the brother was uncomfortable with the niece's behavior but wanted to avoid conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the uncle had a right to protect his property (the fish) and his feelings about the niece's behavior. The niece's actions were inappropriate, so the uncle's response was to correct that. But the public nature of the situation and the way he took the fish back might have been harsh.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The uncle acted in what he believed was right to protect the fish and set a boundary, but he might have handled it differently to avoid hurting the brother's feelings. The brother's reaction is also a point to consider\u2014perhaps he should have addressed his daughter's behavior more firmly earlier. However, the uncle's main issue was the niece's mistreatment of the fish, which is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all this, the uncle's actions might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for debate. However, the key factor is whether he was in the wrong. Since his intention was to protect the fish and the situation was a family matter, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong, but there's a case for both sides. However, given that he apologized and valued the brother's relationship, maybe the answer is B, No.\n"
