My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a pet fish to their niece and then taking it back. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family for dinner. The niece started banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then the girl had a tantrum and wanted the white clownfish. The author gave in and gave the fish to the brother, but the niece shook the bag and the author took it back, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the author's actions: giving the fish initially because the niece was throwing a tantrum and the brother was uncomfortable. Then taking it back when the niece shook the bag, which the author thought was harmful. This caused a rift with the brother.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, giving a fish to a child without considering the long-term care might be an issue. But the author had a good relationship with the brother and didn't want to lose that. The niece's behavior was problematic\u2014tantrum, shaking the fish. The author tried to protect the fish, which is understandable.\n\nBut the key points are: Did the author have the right to give the fish in the first place? Since it was their aquarium, they could give it, but maybe they should have considered if the brother and his family could properly care for it. Also, taking it back after giving it might be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the brother expected to keep it. However, the niece's treatment of the fish was concerning. The author might have been trying to protect the fish's well-being.\n\nThe conflict arises from the author's decision to take back the fish. The brother felt the author was being unreasonable. The author's main concern was the fish's safety, but the brother wanted to keep it to appease his daughter. The author apologized to preserve their relationship, which shows they value the brother's friendship. However, the initial act of giving the fish and then taking it back could be seen as mixed signals. The author might have handled it better by discussing the fish's care with the brother first or not giving it if they thought the niece wouldn't take care of it. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not setting boundaries beforehand. But the niece's behavior was extreme, so the author had reasons to take back the fish. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting the fish, but there's some fault in how they handled the situation. So the answer is B for No.\n"
