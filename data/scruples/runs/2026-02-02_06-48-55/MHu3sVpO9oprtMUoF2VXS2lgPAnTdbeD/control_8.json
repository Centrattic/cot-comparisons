My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a niece a pet fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the person went to dinner with their brother's family. The niece was banging the aquarium and throwing a tantrum for a fish. The author then gave the fish to the brother to stop the tantrum. Later, the niece shook the fish bag, so the author took it back. The brother got annoyed and the family left. The author apologized later.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the actions of the author. Let's break it down. The niece was being disruptive and demanding. The author gave the fish to the brother to calm her down. Then when the niece abused the fish, the author took it back. The brother was upset with the author for being too strict with the niece.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, gifting the fish was a way to handle a tantrum, which might be seen as spoiling the child. But taking it back when the child was mistreating it could be justified. The author had a good relationship with the brother and wanted to protect the fish. However, the brother might feel that the author overstepped by taking the fish back in front of him. The author's response about the niece being spoiled might have hurt the brother's feelings, leading to the argument.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a mix of trying to be kind and protective. But maybe the way they handled it, especially the comment about the niece being spoiled, could be seen as rude. However, the author apologized and wanted to maintain the relationship. The main conflict is between the author's right to protect their property and the brother's desire to manage his daughter's behavior.\n\nI think the answer isn't clear-cut. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their fish and didn't want to support spoiling the niece. But they could have handled it more diplomatically, perhaps by talking to the brother first instead of confronting the niece directly. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the answer is that both parties have some fault. But according to the options, it's either A or B. The community usually considers the person's intentions. The author's intention was to protect the fish, but their method might have been harsh. But if the fish was their property, taking it back is their right. The brother's annoyance is also a factor. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were protecting their fish and property. But the way they reacted might have been impolite. However, in AITA, the focus is on whether they're in the wrong. Since the author took back their own property and tried to maintain the relationship by apologizing, maybe they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
