My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the person (the author) invited their brother and family for dinner. The brother's daughter (the niece) starts banging on the fish tank, stressing the fish. Then she throws a tantrum wanting a white clownfish. The author gives in, gives her the fish, but when the niece starts shaking the bag, the author takes it back. The brother gets annoyed and leaves. The author apologizes later to mend the relationship but is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author gave the fish as a gesture to stop the tantrum. But when the niece was mistreating it, they took it back. The brother felt disrespected, the niece was spoiled. The author's main concern is the relationship with their brother.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The fish was expensive but not super expensive. The author gave it to the niece to calm things down but then took it back when the niece was being careless. The brother's reaction was to tell the author to just give it up. But the author thought the niece was being purposefully harmful.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations. They gave the fish to stop the tantrum and ease the brother's discomfort. Then they took it back to protect the fish. However, the brother felt disrespected by the author's actions, possibly because the author undermined his authority or made a public display of conflict. The author's apology shows they care about the relationship, but the question is whether their actions were wrong.\n\nThe niece's behavior was spoiled and inappropriate, but the author had the right to protect their property. However, giving the fish as a gift and then taking it back might have been seen as disrespectful. Maybe the author should have discussed the situation with the brother first instead of taking action. On the other hand, the niece's actions were harmful, so the author had a valid reason to take the fish back.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the impact on relationships. The author's intention was to protect the fish and possibly teach a lesson, but it led to a rift with the brother. The brother's reaction was also valid because he felt his daughter's happiness was more important. However, the niece's behavior was problematic regardless.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they acted in the fish's best interest and tried to protect their property. The brother's reaction was harsh, and the niece's behavior was the root issue. The author did apologize, which shows they value the relationship. The wrong here might be the niece's actions and the brother's overreaction, not the author's decision to take back the fish.\n"
