My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a niece a fish and then taking it back. The author had invited their brother and family over, and the niece was being disruptive with the fish tank. The author then gave the fish to the brother to stop the tantrum but later took it back when the niece was mistreating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave the fish as a compromise to stop the niece's tantrum, which might have been a good intention. However, when the niece was shaking the fish bag, the author intervened to protect the fish. The brother was upset because the author took back the fish, leading to a rift. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have overstepped by taking the fish back after giving it as a gift. Gifts are usually expected to stay with the recipient unless there's a clear agreement otherwise. The brother might have felt disrespected or that the author didn't trust his parenting. \n\nOn the other hand, the niece's behavior was clearly harmful to the fish. The author had a right to protect their pet. However, the way it was handled\u2014snatching the fish in front of everyone\u2014could have been done more diplomatically. The author's response about the child being spoiled might have been harsh and contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe author did apologize later, showing they valued the relationship with their brother. But the initial act of giving and then taking back the fish without clear consent from the brother might be seen as the mistake. The brother might have expected that once the fish was given, it was the family's responsibility. \n\nSo, while the author had valid concerns about the fish's safety, the method of resolving it and the potential breach of trust with the brother could make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
