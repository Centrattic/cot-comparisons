My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family conflict between the author and their brother over a fish given to the niece.\n\nFirst, the author invited their brother and family for dinner. That's a kind gesture, showing they value their brother's friendship. Then the niece started banging on the aquarium, which stressed the fish. She had a tantrum and wanted the white clownfish. The author tried to comfort her but eventually gave in and gave the fish to the brother. The niece then shook the fish bag, the author took it back, leading to more arguments and the brother leaving.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author gave the fish as a gift but then took it back. The niece's behavior was problematic, but the author's actions might have been reactive. The author's brother felt the author was being too hard on the niece, leading to a rift.\n\nIs giving the fish and then taking it back wrong? Maybe the initial gift was a mistake. The author might have given in under pressure, which could have set a poor example. The niece's behavior was spoiled, but the author's response of snatching the fish back could have been harsh. The brother wanted to diffuse the situation, while the author wanted to discipline the niece. The author apologized later, showing they care about the relationship more than the incident itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the niece's actions were disrespectful to the fish and the author's property. The author had the right to take back the fish if they felt it was being mishandled. However, maybe the way they handled it could have been better. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. The brother might have felt the author was being unreasonable, but the author was protecting their pet. It's a balance between respecting family and standing your ground. Since the author later apologized to maintain the relationship, maybe they realized their actions were impulsive. But the initial giving of the fish as a way to stop the tantrum might not have been the best decision, and then taking it back could be seen as causing more conflict. So the author might be partly at fault for both giving in and then overreacting.\n"
