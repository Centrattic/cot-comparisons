My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fish that was given to the niece and then taken back. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a fish tank and invited their brother and family over. The niece (13 years old) started banging on the tank, stressing the fish. Then she had a tantrum demanding the white clownfish. The author tried to comfort her but she kept fussing. The brother helped the author a lot in university, so the author gave the fish to the brother to make the niece stop. But the niece then shook the fish bag, ignored the author's warning, and the author took the fish back. This led to the brother getting annoyed and leaving. The author apologized later to mend the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The niece was being disruptive, and the author gave the fish to calm her down. However, taking it back after the niece mishandled it might have been impulsive. The author might have overreacted, especially since the fish was a gift. But the niece's behavior was also problematic\u2014shaking the bag and not respecting the animal. The brother might have felt embarrassed, so the author's action could have been a way to protect the fish. However, the author's decision to take back the fish might have caused tension with the brother, who wanted to keep it to make the niece happy. The author apologized, showing they cared about the relationship, but the initial action might have been hasty. The key points are the niece's behavior, the value of the fish, and the brother's reaction. The author's intent was to protect the fish and maintain the relationship, but their method might have been flawed. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The niece was clearly inconsiderate, but the author's actions could have been handled more diplomatically. Maybe the author should have discussed the fish's care with the brother first. But the immediate reaction to take back the fish might not be entirely their fault. However, the fact that they gave it and then took it back without consulting the brother could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they gave the fish as a gesture, then took it back without considering the brother's perspective, which might have caused the rift.\n"
