My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That\u2019s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It\u2019s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn\u2019t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their niece a fish and then taking it back. \n\nFirst, the author had a dinner with their brother and his family. The niece was being disruptive by banging on the fish tank, which stressed the fish. She then had a tantrum and wanted the white clown fish. The author, not wanting to upset their brother, gave her the fish. But then the niece shook the bag, and the author took it back, leading to tension with the brother.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the niece's behavior, the author's decision to give the fish, then taking it back, and the fallout with the brother.\n\nThe author gave the niece the fish to stop her tantrum and make their brother comfortable. That seems like a kind gesture. But when the niece shook the bag, the author took it back to protect the fish. However, the brother was upset because the author didn't let the niece keep the fish, leading to a rift.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they gave the fish as a gift, but the niece wasn't taking care of it. The author had a right to protect their pet. But maybe the author should have explained that the fish needed proper care and that shaking the bag was harmful. Instead, they took it back abruptly, which might have caused the niece to cry and the brother to be upset. \n\nThe author apologized later to save the relationship, which shows they value the brother's friendship. But taking back the fish might have been necessary for the fish's well-being. The brother's daughter was spoiled and didn't respect the fish. The author's actions were to protect their pet, but maybe they could have handled it more diplomatically, like explaining the fish's needs instead of just taking it back.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their pet. But they could have handled the situation better to avoid hurting their brother's feelings. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they took back a gift they gave, maybe that's where the conflict is. But the fish was a personal pet, so the author had the right to take it back if it was being mistreated. The brother might have felt disrespected, but the author's priority was the fish's safety. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they acted to protect their pet. However, the way they handled it could have been better. But ultimately, they had the right to take back their fish if it was in danger.\n"
