      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants to give their son the name Alejandro, despite not being Hispanic, is in the wrong. The friend called them an asshole for appropriating culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural appropriation. There's a difference between appreciating a culture and appropriating it. Using a name from another culture isn't inherently wrong, but it can be if it's done without respect or understanding. In this case, the parents aren't Hispanic and aren't religious. They just like the name Alejandro. \n\nNext, names often transcend cultures. Many names are used across different ethnicities. For example, \"David\" is a common name in various cultures. If the name is chosen because it's liked and fits the child, it's more about personal preference rather than appropriation. Also, the parents are giving a name to their child, which is a personal choice unless it's causing harm or disrespect.\n\nHowever, the friend's argument is about appropriating culture without reason. The key here is whether the choice of the name is respectful. Alejandro is a common Hispanic name, but it's also a Spanish name that's used in various contexts. If the parents are not mocking the culture or using it as a trend, but simply prefer the name, it's more about personal taste. \n\nAnother angle is that names can become a part of identity. But the parents aren't claiming Hispanic heritage. They are just selecting a name they like. There's no evidence here of disrespect or harm. The friend's reaction might stem from a concern about cultural sensitivity, but unless there's a deeper issue, like the name being used in a derogatory way, the parents aren't necessarily wrong. \n\nIn summary, unless there's a specific context where the name choice is causing offense or disrespect, the parents choosing a name they like for their child isn't in the wrong. It's a personal decision that doesn't inherently appropriate culture if done respectfully.\n"
