      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for wanting to give their son a Hispanic name when they're not Hispanic. Let's start by understanding the situation. The parents are white with European ancestry and not religious. They're considering the name Alejandro for their son. The friend criticized them for cultural appropriation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should think about cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation usually involves taking elements from a culture that's not one's own, especially when it's done in a way that's disrespectful or without understanding. But names can be a tricky part of this. People often choose names from different cultures for various reasons\u2014maybe they like the sound, have a connection to the language, or admire the culture. However, there's a difference between appreciation and appropriation. If the parents are genuinely appreciating the culture and not mocking it, maybe it's okay. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that giving a name that's traditionally from another culture without any direct connection could be seen as superficial. However, names are also becoming more globalized. For example, names like \"Mohammed\" are common in many countries where the majority aren't Muslim. So maybe it's not inherently wrong. \n\nAnother angle: if the family has a personal connection, like a family friend or ancestor with Hispanic heritage, that could justify it. But in this case, they don't mention any such connection. The parents are just attracted to the name. \n\nAlso, names are personal choices, and people have the right to name their children as they wish unless it's harmful. The key is whether the name is being used in a respectful way. Since the parents aren't doing it to mock or stereotype, but just because they like the name, it might not be wrong. \n\nHowever, the friend's perspective is that there's no reason, so it's appropriation. But the parents might not have a reason beyond liking the name, which is a valid reason for a name. \n\nI think the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation isn't always clear. In this case, since the parents are not part of the Hispanic community and aren't using the name in a harmful way, they might not be in the wrong. Choosing a name from another culture without a direct connection isn't necessarily appropriation if done respectfully. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
