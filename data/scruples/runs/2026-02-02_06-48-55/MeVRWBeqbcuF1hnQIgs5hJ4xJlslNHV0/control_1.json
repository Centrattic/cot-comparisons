Me and my wife are both 100% white european ancestry. We're both not religious either.\n\nI told my friend my thoughts and he said Im a bit of an asshole for appropriating culture like that without any reason, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether someone is in the wrong for wanting to give their son a Hispanic name when they aren't Hispanic themselves. The context is that the parents are white, non-religious, and the name they like is Alejandro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural appropriation versus appreciation. Cultural appropriation often involves taking elements from a culture in a way that's disrespectful or without understanding, especially when there's a power imbalance. However, using a name from another culture isn't always appropriation. It can be appreciation if it's done respectfully and with awareness.\n\nThe friend called them an \"asshole,\" suggesting cultural appropriation. But the parents are choosing a name for their child, which is a personal choice. Names can transcend cultures, and many people choose names outside their heritage without issue. For example, names like Emily or Ethan are used across various ethnicities without criticism. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances with Hispanic names. If the name carries specific cultural or religious significance that the parents aren't acknowledging, that could be a point of contention. But Alejandro is a common Spanish name, and without any indication that the parents are mocking or misrepresenting the culture, it seems more like a personal preference.\n\nAlso, the parents aren't Hispanic, but they're not using the name to claim Hispanic identity. They're just choosing a name they like. The friend's reaction might stem from a valid concern about cultural sensitivity, but unless the parents are being dismissive of the culture's context, it's a personal choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are likely not in the wrong here. They're making a choice based on their preference without evidence of disrespect. The answer should be B.\n"
