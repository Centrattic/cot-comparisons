      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to give their son a Hispanic name, Alejandro, when they're not Hispanic. Both parents are white European and not religious.\n\nFirst, the concept of cultural appropriation comes up here. Cultural appropriation is when someone adopts elements from a culture that's not their own, often in a way that's disrespectful or trivializes the culture. But when it comes to names, it's a bit tricky. Names are often chosen for various reasons like personal preference, admiration for the culture, or even just because they like the sound. \n\nNow, Alejandro is a Spanish-derived name meaning \"defender of men.\" It's common in Hispanic and some European cultures. The parents aren't Hispanic, but they're not trying to pass as such. They just like the name. The friend called them an asshole for appropriating culture without reason. The key here is whether there's a context of exploitation or disrespect. If the name is chosen without any negative intent and the family is transparent about their background, it's more about personal choice. \n\nHowever, some might argue that using a name from another culture without any connection could be seen as appropriation. But others would say that names are part of a shared global culture and it's okay to choose them for aesthetic reasons. The line between appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. Since the parents are not mocking or trivializing the culture, and they're aware of their own cultural background, it's more about personal preference. \n\nAlso, considering the baby's future, the name itself doesn't define cultural identity. The child's identity will be shaped by the family's values and culture, not just the name. So, the act of choosing a name from another culture isn't inherently wrong if it's done respectfully. The friend's reaction might stem from a place of concern about cultural sensitivity, but the parents aren't necessarily in the wrong if their intentions are good. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because choosing a name is a personal choice and doesn't inherently appropriate culture unless done in a disrespectful or exploitative way.\n"
