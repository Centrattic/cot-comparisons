It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author sews as a hobby and doesn't do it for others. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, citing being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to spend time on one-time use items. She suggested alternatives, but the sister was upset, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook. The sister's side portrays the author as selfish, and the niece even cried in a video. Meanwhile, the author feels the request is a waste of time since kids won't appreciate the effort.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's within her rights to say no. She's not obligated to use her hobby to fulfill her sister's request. People have the right to set boundaries, especially with family. However, the sister's reaction might be seen as over the top, especially dragging Facebook into it and making the niece cry. The sister might believe the author should prioritize family over her own time, but that's a cultural expectation that varies. \n\nThe key points are: the author is clear about her limits, didn't offer to do it for free, and tried to help with alternatives. The sister's response is aggressive and public, which might indicate she's the one being unreasonable. The author's reasons are valid\u2014she's not in the habit of sewing for others, and the practicality of making a dress for a child who might not appreciate it. The sister's argument that family should help each other without limits is common, but the author isn't refusing all help, just this specific request. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's respecting her own boundaries. The sister's public shaming and emotional manipulation (getting the niece to cry) are more problematic. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
