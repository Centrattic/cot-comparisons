It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making the dress for her niece. The situation involves family expectations and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for income. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by her mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, explaining she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds one-time use items like children's clothes not worth the effort. The sister got upset, called her selfish, even brought the issue on Facebook, making the author feel bad. The niece cried in a video, which made the author question her decision.\n\nNow, considering the author's reasons: she's clear about her boundaries. She's using her hobby for personal projects, which is her right. Making a dress for a child might not be something she's willing to do, especially since it's a one-time use. The sister's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially using social media to shame her. The author also gave alternative suggestions, which the sister rejected. \n\nThe sister's argument is that family should help each other, and sewing is a skill she could use. But the author didn't sew for personal gain and had valid reasons. The sister's own choice not to learn sewing (as she mentioned playing video games instead) is a point the author brings up, which adds context. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's refusal isn't selfish if she's honest about her boundaries. The sister's approach was confrontational and public, which escalated the conflict. The author isn't obligated to use her skills for others unless she's been asked in a respectful manner. The niece's emotional reaction doesn't negate the author's right to say no. \n\nSo, the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She maintained her boundaries, communicated her reasons, and offered alternatives. The sister's response was more about public shaming and not respecting the author's personal time and hobby.\n"
