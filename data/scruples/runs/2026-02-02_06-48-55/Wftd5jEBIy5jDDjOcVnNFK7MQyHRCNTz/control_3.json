It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining to sew an Easter dress for her niece on several grounds: being busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time-use items. Her sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to social media, which made the author feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's clear about her reasons for refusing: she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and feels the effort isn't worth it for a single-use item. Those are valid personal boundaries. People have the right to say no to requests that don't align with their values or priorities. \n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She accused the author of being selfish and implied that the author would help her own kids if the roles were reversed. The sister also brought the issue to Facebook, which escalated the conflict. The niece was used to play the victim, which adds emotional manipulation. The sister's approach seems harsh and possibly unfair, as she didn't respect the author's boundaries and public shaming is a strong move.\n\nThe author's response was to suggest alternative solutions (shops) and remind the sister that she had the opportunity to learn sewing but chose not to. That's standing up for her own time and choices. However, the author might have considered the emotional aspect of the request\u2014her niece might have wanted a special dress, and the sister felt it was important. But the author isn't obligated to fulfill every family request, especially when it's a hobby, not a service.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if others don't like it. The sister overreacted and used social media to pressure the author, which isn't constructive. The author's reasons are legitimate, and while the situation is emotionally charged, she's not being selfish for prioritizing her own time and not wanting to do something for one-time use.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
