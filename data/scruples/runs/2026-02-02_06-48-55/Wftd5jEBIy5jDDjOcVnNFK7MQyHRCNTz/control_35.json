It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece, and the sister getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author sews as a hobby, not for income, and primarily makes her own clothes. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter, but she declined, giving reasons like being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort, and it's for a photo. The sister then got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others criticized the author. The niece even cried in a video, which made the author question her decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister's perspective is that as a family member, the author should help out, especially since she was taught to sew by their mom. The sister feels it's a simple request, and the author is being selfish. On the other hand, the author is clear about her boundaries\u2014her sewing is a personal hobby, she doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds it not worth her time. She even offered alternatives like shops.\n\nThe key factors here are autonomy and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to use her skills for others unless she wants to. The sister's expectation might be based on a different understanding of what the author wants to do. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The author tried to be polite and offered alternatives, but the sister didn't accept that. The author's reasoning about not wanting to sew for children's one-time use items is valid from her perspective. \n\nBut could there be a middle ground? For example, maybe the author could have offered to teach the sister to sew, but she didn't. Or maybe she could have said no more gently. However, she did explain her reasons and suggested alternatives. The sister's reaction was harsh, and the public shaming might be more about the sister's own feelings than the author's actions. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting personal boundaries is important. The author isn't being asked to do something she doesn't want to do for money; it's a personal favor. However, in family contexts, there's often an unspoken expectation of helping. But the author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. The sister's response seems more about feeling rejected and possibly not understanding the author's hobby's purpose.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's within her rights to say no and explain her reasons. The sister's actions and public shaming are the real issues here. The answer should be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
