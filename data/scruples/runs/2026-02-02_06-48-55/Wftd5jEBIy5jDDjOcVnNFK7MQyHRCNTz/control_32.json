It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby and makes their own clothes. They were asked by their sister to sew a dress for her daughter. The author declined, explaining they're busy, don't enjoy sewing for others, and dislike making one-time use items. They also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the work, and the dress would just be for a photo. Then the sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others criticized the author. The sister even had the niece cry about it.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries and expectations. The author is setting a boundary around their time and hobby. They're not obligated to help, especially since it's not their responsibility. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but the author's refusal might come off as dismissive. The author also brought up past grievances about the sister not learning to sew, which might have been a low blow.\n\nThe sister's argument is that family should help each other, and she expected her sister to do the same. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to do it. They're not being selfish if they're clear about their limits. However, the way they refused might have been a bit harsh, especially bringing up past issues. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is unkind or beyond reasonable boundaries. They did offer alternatives (suggesting shops), but the sister was unappreciative. The author isn't in the wrong for saying no, but maybe could have handled it more tactfully. The sister's use of the niece to guilt-trip adds to the emotional manipulation. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't obligated to make the dress. They have the right to prioritize their own time and hobbies. The sister's reaction and the public shaming are more about her own frustration than the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
