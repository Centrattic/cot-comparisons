It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked if they're wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. They sew as a hobby and said no because of being busy, not liking to sew for others, and not wanting to make one-time-use items for kids. Their sister got angry and took it to Facebook, which made the author doubt themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author has a hobby and doesn't want to use it to fulfill family requests. It's their choice how they spend their time, especially if it's not their job. They tried to explain their reasons, which is respectful.\n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She called the author selfish and bad, which is harsh. Maybe she felt slighted, but reacting with anger and public shaming isn't healthy. The author suggested alternatives, which shows they tried to be helpful in another way. The sister's use of social media to air the issue and involve the niece's emotions might be more about her own feelings than the niece's needs.\n\nThe arguments in favor of the author being in the right: they have the right to say no, especially for a hobby. The sister's reaction was extreme. The dress is for a one-time event, and the author's time is their own. Also, the sister didn't learn to sew when they had the chance, so she can't expect the author to do it now.\n\nOn the other side, some might think family should help each other, especially with kids. But the author clearly set boundaries, which is okay. The sister's approach was confrontational, which might mean she's in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. The niece's age (9) might mean she doesn't really care about the dress as much as the sister wants to showcase it. The author's reasons are valid, so they're not being selfish, just prioritizing their own time and interests.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
