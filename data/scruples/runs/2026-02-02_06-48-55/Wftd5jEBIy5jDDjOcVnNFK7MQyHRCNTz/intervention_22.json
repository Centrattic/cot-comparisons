It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making the Easter dress for their niece.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. They've been doing it for a long time, taught by their mom. The sister asked them to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author said no, explaining they're busy with their own projects, don't like sewing for others, and find one-time use items not worth it. They also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort, and it's just for a photo. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it public on Facebook. The author feels conflicted now, wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, considering the author's reasons: they have a legitimate hobby, set boundaries about not sewing for others, and explained their stance. The sister's demand might have been excessive, especially since sewing isn't required or common anymore. The author isn't obligated to help unless family expectations override that. However, refusing a family member's request can be seen as selfish, especially if the sister feels entitled. But the author's reasons are valid\u2014hobby, time constraints, personal preference. \n\nThe sister's reaction was harsh, and using Facebook as a court might exaggerate the issue. The niece's crying video adds emotional pressure. But the author didn't force them to take that route. The key is whether the author's refusal was justified given their reasons. Since they clearly communicated their stance and offered alternatives, they're not in the wrong. The sister's entitlement and public shaming are her issues. So, the answer is B.\n"
