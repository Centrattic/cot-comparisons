It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby and made it clear she doesn't want to sew for others or do one-time use items. Her sister got upset, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clear about her boundaries: she sews for herself, not others, and avoids time-limited projects. She explained her reasons, offered alternatives, and the sister took it personally. The sister's reaction seems to be about feeling rejected, maybe with some guilt-tripping. The author didn't force the sister to take her suggestions, but the sister escalated the situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning about the dress being a one-time use and kids not appreciating the effort is valid. Sewing for someone else, especially a child, can be a lot of work with little reward. The sister's argument that the author would help her kids is a classic guilt ploy, implying the author isn't a good sister. But the author isn't obligated to help unless there's an expectation of mutual support, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe Facebook post and the niece crying in the video seem like attempts to publicly shame the author. The sister's actions might be more about her own insecurities or a desire to be seen as a good mother rather than a legitimate need. The author stood her ground, which is important for setting boundaries. While it's sad that the sister took it so personally, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own time and hobby. People should respect each other's limits without guilt-tripping. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
