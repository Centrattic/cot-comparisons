It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making a dress for her niece. \n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for work. They make their own clothes and have been doing it for a long time. Their sister asked them to sew an Easter dress for the niece, but the author said no. The reasons given are that they're busy with their own projects, don't enjoy sewing for others, and don't like making one-time use items. They also mention that kids don't appreciate the effort and it's just for a photo.\n\nThe sister got angry, called the author selfish, and took it to social media. The author then suggested stores, which made the sister angrier. The author also mentioned that the sister didn't learn to sew because she preferred other activities. The niece cried in a video, and the author is now second-guessing themselves.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author has every right to say no to sewing for others, especially since it's a personal hobby. They explained their reasons clearly. The sister's reaction seems over the top, especially bringing kids into it and using social media to shame. The author isn't obligated to do this, and their reasons are valid. They offered alternatives, which the sister dismissed. The sister's actions, like involving the niece and Facebook, might be more about guilt-tripping. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
