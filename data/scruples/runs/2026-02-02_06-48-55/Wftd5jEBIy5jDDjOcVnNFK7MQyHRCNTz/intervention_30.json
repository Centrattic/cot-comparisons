It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation involves family conflict and differing values.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by her mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter, but she declined, explaining she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds one-time use items like kids' dresses not worth the effort. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook where others supported the sister's viewpoint. The niece even cried in a video.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes not wanting to sew for others, valuing her time, and not seeing the point in making something for a child that won't last. She also mentioned that the sister didn't learn to sew herself, which might add to her frustration. \n\nOn the other side, the sister felt entitled because she believed family should help each other, especially with children's needs. The author's refusal was seen as selfish, and the sister's public shaming added to the tension.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author isn't obligated to do favors. She's clear about her boundaries. However, family dynamics can complicate this. The sister's expectations might be based on a different perspective, expecting familial support. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. She's using her hobby, not professional time. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially using the niece's emotions and public shaming. The author's response of suggesting alternatives and explaining her stance seems reasonable. \n\nThe key points are personal boundaries vs. family obligations. The author isn't the asshole for not helping, especially since she's not being selfish in a harmful way. The sister's entitlement and public shaming are more problematic. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
