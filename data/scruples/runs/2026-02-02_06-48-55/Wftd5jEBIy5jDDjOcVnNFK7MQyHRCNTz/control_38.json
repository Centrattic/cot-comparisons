It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person (the author) is being asked by their sister to sew an Easter dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author declines, giving reasons like being busy with their own sewing projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to do one-time use items. The sister is upset, labels the author as selfish, and takes it public on Facebook, causing the author to feel bad and question themselves. The niece even cried in a video about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for declining and the sister's reaction. The author's main arguments are that they enjoy sewing as a hobby for themselves, not for others, and that making a one-time use dress for a child isn't worth the effort. They also mention that the child won't appreciate it, and it's the mom who wants it for a photo. The sister, on the other hand, feels the author is being selfish and unhelpful, especially since the author suggests the sister should have learned to sew herself instead of asking for help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The author is clear that sewing is a personal hobby, not a service they offer. They've turned down similar requests before, like wedding dresses. So, consistency there might be important. The sister's request is for a niece, so family expectations might come into play. However, the author is under no obligation to help; it's a family member, but not a legal or moral one, unless there's some unspoken agreement.\n\nThe sister's reaction is quite strong\u2014calling the author selfish, taking it to Facebook, using the niece to cry. That seems like a harsh response. The author tried to be polite, offered alternatives (suggesting shops), and even tried to explain their reasoning. The sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional reaction could be seen as manipulative or using the child for leverage. The author's frustration about the effort not being appreciated is valid. Sewing takes time and skill; if they don't enjoy doing it for others, that's their prerogative.\n\nAnother angle: is the author being a bad sister? Well, they're not refusing to help in general\u2014they\u2019re just not willing to sew for others. They could have offered to teach the sister how to sew, but they didn't. However, they do mention that the sister had the opportunity to learn from their mom but chose other hobbies. So maybe the author feels it's the sister's responsibility if she wants to sew something. The author isn't refusing to help the niece directly but is declining the request based on personal boundaries.\n\nThe public shaming and emotional manipulation by the sister might be more about the sister's own insecurities or expectations of what family should do for each other. The author might be standing up for their own time and interests, which is a valid boundary. However, family dynamics can complicate things. In some cultures or families, there's an expectation that family members help each other with such tasks, but the author isn't violating any explicit rule here. They\u2019re not a professional seamstress, so the expectation might not be reasonable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for declining a family request when they have a stated boundary. The author provided explanations and alternatives, which shows they tried to be considerate. The sister's reaction is more about how she feels wronged, possibly projecting her own feelings of not getting what she wants onto the author. The niece's crying is likely orchestrated to gain sympathy, which could be seen as the sister's manipulation rather than the author's fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting personal boundaries. They made a clear decision based on their own priorities and tried to be helpful in other ways. The sister's reaction, including public shaming and using the child, is more problematic. The author is not obligated to fulfill the request, especially since it's a one-time use and not part of their professional work. So the answer should be B (Not the author's fault).\n"
