It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece, leading to some conflict with her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author sews as a hobby, not for income. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by her mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter, but the author declined, explaining she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and doesn't like making one-time use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the work, and it's a waste. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took the issue to Facebook, making the author feel bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to say no, the sister's reaction, and the social media component. The author is clear that sewing is a personal hobby. She's not obligated to use her skills for others unless she wants to. People often have hobbies they choose not to share, especially if it's not their job. The sister's request might seem reasonable, but the author isn't responsible for others' expectations. \n\nThe sister's response was harsh and public, which complicates things. She accused the author of being selfish and a bad sister, then used Facebook to get support, which might be more about her own feelings than the niece's needs. The niece crying on video is emotional but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author stood her ground and gave alternatives (suggesting shops), which shows she tried to help without sewing.\n\nThe author's reasons for declining are valid. She values her time and chooses how to spend it. It's reasonable to say no to requests that aren't aligned with one's interests, even within family. The sister's public shaming and labeling the author as selfish could be the real issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The sister might need to respect those boundaries instead of demanding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to fulfill the request, especially since it's a hobby and not a service she offers. The sister's reaction and public shaming are the problematic parts here.\n"
