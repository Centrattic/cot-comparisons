It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author, who sews as a hobby, was right to refuse making an Easter dress for her niece. \n\nFirst, the author explains that sewing is her hobby, not a job, and she uses it to make clothes for herself. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by their mom. Her sister asked her to sew a dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author turned her down, giving reasons like being busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and considering one-time use items like kids' clothes a waste. She even mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort, and it's for a photo. \n\nThe sister got angry, called her selfish, and said she'd help if the author needed anything. The author suggested stores instead, which made the sister angrier. Then the sister took it to Facebook, where people criticized the author. The niece even cried on video, making it emotional for the author, who's now doubting herself.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's reasons for declining: personal boundaries, not wanting to sew for others, and the practical aspect of kids' clothes being used once. On the other side, the sister felt entitled because the author's sister would help her if needed. The sister's approach might have been manipulative, using the niece's crying and social media shaming to guilt-trip the author.\n\nThe author didn't force her sister to ask, and she's clear that sewing is a personal hobby. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries, especially when it's a hobby and not an obligation. The sister's reaction seems more about entitlement and not respecting those boundaries. The author also offered alternatives, which shows she tried to be helpful. The fact that the sister didn't learn to sew herself, as the author pointed out, might indicate that she's not respecting the effort involved. \n\nSocial media shaming is a red flag here. People often don't understand the time and skill involved in crafts like sewing. The author's stance is about personal choice and respecting her own time and effort. It's not selfish if she's clear about her boundaries and offers alternatives. The sister's reaction is more about wanting something without considering the labor involved. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to say no and set her limits. The sister overreacted and used guilt tactics, which isn't fair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
