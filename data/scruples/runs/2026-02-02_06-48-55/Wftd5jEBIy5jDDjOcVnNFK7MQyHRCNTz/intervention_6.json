It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nThe author sews as a hobby, not for work. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by her mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and avoids one-time-use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort and it's just for a photo. She suggested stores but the sister was upset, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The sister's daughter even cried in a video. Now the author is second-guessing herself.\n\nSo, why might the author be wrong? Maybe family is important and she should have helped. Sisters might expect support, especially with kids. The sister felt the request was simple, just a few seams. Also, the sister framed it as not appreciating being a mother, which could add emotional weight. The author's response of telling her sister to buy a machine might come off as harsh, especially since their mom wanted her to learn sewing but she chose other activities. The author's refusal might seem selfish from the sister's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point. Sewing is her hobby, and she should be able to choose how to use her time. The dress is a one-time use, which might not be worth her effort. She's not obligated to use her skills for others, especially when she doesn't enjoy it. The sister's reaction could be over the top, using the niece's feelings to pressure her. The author's explanation about not sewing for others and the effort involved makes sense. Also, suggesting stores was a practical solution, but the sister dismissed it.\n\nThe key here is the balance between personal boundaries and family expectations. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially since it's a hobby. However, the sister's feelings and the family dynamics might mean that the author's refusal caused hurt. The author might have handled it differently, like offering to help in another way or explaining more gently. But the sister's use of the Facebook court and the niece's tears could be manipulative tactics. The author's response about the sister not learning to sew could have been more tactful, but she's not wrong for pointing out past choices.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. She's within her rights to prioritize her own time and enjoyment. The sister's reaction is more about how they perceive the request rather than the author's actual wrongdoing. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to choose how she spends her time, especially with her own hobby. The sister's expectations and the manipulation tactics used are more about their family dynamics than the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n"
