It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author declining to make an Easter dress for their niece. The author sews as a hobby, not for work, and has a lot of reasons for saying no. The sister got angry and took it to Facebook, which made the author question themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They made it clear they don't enjoy sewing for others, are busy with their own projects, and don't like one-time use items. They also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort. These are valid personal reasons. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if their hobby isn't a service they offer. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister felt entitled to the favor, maybe expecting the author to help because they were taught to sew by their mom. The sister's reaction, calling the author selfish and bad, seems harsh. The author did offer alternatives, like suggesting shops, but the sister didn't appreciate that. The niece crying on video might be an emotional tactic to pressure the author. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries versus family expectations. The author isn't obligated to help if they don't want to. The sister's entitlement and public shaming could be more about her own frustration than the niece's needs. The author's reasons for declining are their own to decide. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to say no. The sister's response was more about her own feelings of being slighted rather than the niece genuinely needing a dress. The author's explanation about not wanting to sew for others and being busy is understandable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
