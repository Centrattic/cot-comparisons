It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's clear about her boundaries: she doesn't sew for others, avoids one-time-use items, and feels that sewing for kids is a waste because the kids don't appreciate it. She communicated her reasons to her sister, who then took it personally and brought in others for support. The sister accused her of selfishness and implied the author wouldn't help her kids if they needed something. The niece's crying video added emotional weight, and the sister used social media to shame her, which probably made things worse.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's setting clear boundaries. She's not obligated to sew for others, even family. The sister's reaction seems to stem from feeling slighted and possibly using the situation to project her own values (like motherhood and family expectations). The author's refusal is about her own priorities and time, which is valid. However, the sister's approach was confrontational and public, which might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily. The key here is whether refusing a family request is selfish. Since the author has communicated her reasons and isn't being asked to sacrifice something significant, it's more about personal choice. The sister's reaction seems more about perceived disrespect rather than the actual act of refusing. The niece's age and the fact that it's a one-time use also support the author's point about the effort not being worth it. The sister could have found an alternative solution, like buying a dress or learning to sew herself. The author's response about the sister's past choices (video games, etc.) might have been a bit harsh, but overall, the author's stance is about maintaining her hobby as a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The sister's handling of the situation is problematic, but the author's refusal is justified.\n"
