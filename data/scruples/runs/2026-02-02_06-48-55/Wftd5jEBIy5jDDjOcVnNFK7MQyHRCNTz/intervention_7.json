It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to make an Easter dress for her niece. The author sews as a hobby and doesn't enjoy sewing for others or one-time use items. Her sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a clear boundary: she sews for herself, not for others. She communicated her reasons\u2014being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to do something for a single use. The sister felt entitled to her help, which the author didn't provide, leading to public shaming.\n\nFrom an autonomy perspective, the author has the right to set boundaries. It's her hobby, and she's not obligated to use her skills for the family unless she wants to. The sister's reaction seems over the top, especially using the child to guilt-trip. The author didn't force anyone and even offered alternatives. The sister's public shaming and the niece's crying might indicate manipulation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family obligations, especially with children, are important. But the author is clear that she doesn't enjoy sewing for others and isn't in a position to change that just for the request. The sister's entitlement to her time and skills could be a factor here.\n\nThe public shaming on Facebook adds another layer. The sister's actions seem more about defending her own choices (like not learning to sew) and projecting that the author is selfish. The author's response to suggest the sister learn to sew herself was probably meant to be honest but might have come off as harsh, but it's within her right to express that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because she set boundaries and stood by them. The sister's reaction is more about her own expectations and lack of appreciation for the author's time and effort. The key here is whether the author had an obligation, which she doesn't. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
