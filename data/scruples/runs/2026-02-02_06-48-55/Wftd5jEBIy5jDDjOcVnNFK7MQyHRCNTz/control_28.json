It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation is that the author sews as a hobby and was asked by their sister to make a dress for their niece. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy with their own projects, disliking sewing for others, and valuing the effort for one-time use. The sister got angry, accused them of being selfish, and took it to Facebook, which made the author feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons for saying no seem valid. They have a hobby they enjoy, which is making their own clothes. They clearly stated their boundaries, which is important. People have the right to say no, especially when it's a personal hobby rather than a professional obligation. The sister's reaction seems over the top. She not only got angry but also took the issue public, which can be hurtful. The niece crying in a video adds emotional weight, but it's a manipulation tactic to guilt-trip the author.\n\nThe sister's argument that the author should have made the dress because she \"obviously\" would do the same for her kids is a classic tit-for-tat. However, the author's kids aren't mentioned needing anything similar, so that's a bit of a red herring. The author also pointed out that the sister didn't learn to sew when given the opportunity, which is a fair point. People can't expect others to do what they themselves aren't willing to do.\n\nThe Facebook court situation is problematic. Public shaming and emotional manipulation are not healthy ways to resolve disagreements. The sister's actions here are more concerning than the author's refusal. The author is not obligated to fulfill the request, especially when it's a personal hobby and not a family duty. The fact that the author offered alternatives (suggesting shops) shows they tried to be helpful, even though they declined the actual sewing.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, there's pressure on family members to help out, but it's also important to respect personal boundaries. The author's time and effort are their own to manage. The sister's reaction and the public shaming are more about her own frustration than the niece's needs. The niece's age (9 years old) means she might not truly understand the effort involved, and the author's point about children not appreciating the work is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their reasons clearly, tried to offer alternatives, and the sister's response and public shaming escalated the situation unnecessarily. The key here is that the author isn't obligated to do something that's a personal hobby and not their responsibility. The sister's actions are more at fault here.\n"
