It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments from both sides. The author explains that sewing is a hobby, not a job. She's been doing it for a long time, and she's clear about her boundaries. She told her sister no, but tried to be polite. She gave reasons like being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to make one-time use items. She also mentions that kids won't appreciate the work, and it's for a photo for the mom. Then she suggested stores, which made her sister angry. The sister took it to Facebook, and the niece cried in a video. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nOn the other side, the sister feels slighted. She wanted her daughter to have a homemade dress for Easter, maybe expecting family support. The sister is upset that the author didn't help, even after being told she could buy a machine herself. The sister's comments about the author being selfish and a bad sister are harsh, but maybe she felt her request was small. The niece's reaction is emotional, which might be used to guilt-trip the author.\n\nThe key points are about personal boundaries vs. family expectations. The author is within her rights to say no. Hobbies are personal, and using them for family favors can be a problem if not wanted. The author communicated her reasons, which is important. The sister's response seems over the top, especially with the Facebook post and the niece's act. The author's response of suggesting stores and pointing out the sister didn't learn to sew could come off as harsh, but it's also a defense of her own time.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main question is if there's a clear transgression. Here, the author didn't do anything unethical. She set boundaries and explained her stance. The sister overreacted. The author isn't in the wrong for not helping, especially since she has her own priorities. The sister might not have considered the author's feelings or her hobby's purpose. The niece's age (9) makes it so she might not understand the situation, but the sister is an adult responsible for her own choices.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The sister is expecting the author to accommodate without considering her own time and preferences. The author isn't obligated to do family favors that she doesn't want to, especially when it's not a source of income or obligation.\n"
