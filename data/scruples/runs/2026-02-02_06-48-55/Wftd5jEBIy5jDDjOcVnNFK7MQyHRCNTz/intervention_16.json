It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation is that the author sews as a hobby, made their own clothes, and when their sister asked them to make a dress for her daughter, they declined. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and the author ended up feeling bad after the sister posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mentioned that they don't sew for others, don't enjoy it, and don't like making one-time use items. They also thought that children wouldn't appreciate the effort, and it's just for a photo. The sister, on the other hand, felt entitled because maybe she expected the author to help since they know how to sew, and the author used to sew with their mom. The sister even implied that if the author's own kids needed something, she'd do it, so the author should too.\n\nNow, the author's side: they have a hobby, not a job. They made clear their reasons for not sewing the dress. They even suggested alternatives, like stores. The sister didn't take that well and took it to Facebook, which adds context about the sister's approach. The author is now doubting themselves because of the negative reactions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, saying no to a family request isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to set boundaries, especially with their time and hobbies. The author didn't owe the sister anything. However, the way they handled it might have been part of the problem. When the sister got angry, the author responded with a bit of a harsh comment about the sister not learning to sew. That might have escalated things.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also important. Taking the issue public and involving the niece to make the author feel guilty could be seen as manipulative. But the author's refusal might have been considered selfish by others, especially if they view family obligations as important. However, the author's perspective is valid because they're not obligated to use their hobby for others unless they choose to.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They had the right to decline. However, maybe they could have handled the sister's anger better or explained their reasons more compassionately. But ultimately, it's their choice whether to use their hobby for others. The sister's reaction was likely more at fault here. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
