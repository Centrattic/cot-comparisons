It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for refusing to make an Easter dress for their niece. They have a hobby of sewing and making their own clothes, but they don't enjoy sewing for others, especially for one-time use like an Easter dress. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to social media, which made the author feel bad.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons for saying no: they're busy with their own projects, they don't like making one-time-use items, and they think it's a waste of time for kids who won't appreciate it. They also mentioned the sister didn't learn to sew herself. The sister responded by saying the author is selfish and bad, and brought it to Facebook with the niece crying about it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of family obligations. The author isn't obligated to sew for others unless it's a deal or mutual agreement. It's a hobby, not a job. The sister is imposing a request on a personal hobby, which the author isn't interested in. The sister's reaction is over the top, especially bringing in the niece's crying and social media shaming. That seems like emotional manipulation.\n\nThe sister also didn't respect the author's boundaries when they said no. The author provided alternatives like shops, but the sister rejected them. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. However, there's a part where the author thought about children not appreciating the work, which might come off as dismissive. But that's part of their reasoning.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The sister's response and public shaming are problematic. The author has the right to say no to personal requests that they don't want to fulfill. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
