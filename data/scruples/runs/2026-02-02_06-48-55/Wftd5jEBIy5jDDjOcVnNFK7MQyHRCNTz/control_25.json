It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to sew a dress for their niece for Easter. \n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, primarily for themselves, and doesn't enjoy doing it for others. They also mention that they don't like making one-time use items, which they see as a waste of time. They clearly communicated their reasons to their sister, but the sister got angry and took it to social media, which upset the author. The sister's arguments were that the author is selfish and that she would do the same for the author's kids. The niece also cried about not getting the dress.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They set boundaries, which is important. They explained their reasons, which are valid\u2014personal time, not enjoying sewing for others, and the dress being a one-time use. However, the sister's reaction was harsh, and the author's response of telling her to get a sewing machine might have been a bit harsh too, but it's a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's argument is that family should support each other, and maybe there's an expectation that since the author knows how to sew, they should do it for family. But the author isn't obligated to use their hobby for others unless they want to. The sister's public shaming complicates it, but the author's refusal itself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe key points here are personal boundaries vs. family expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do something they don't enjoy, especially when they've communicated that. The sister is in the wrong for overreacting and taking it public. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
