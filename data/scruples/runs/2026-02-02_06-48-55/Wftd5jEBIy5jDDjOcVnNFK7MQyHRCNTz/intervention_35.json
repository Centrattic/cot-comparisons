It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author refusing to sew a dress for her niece for Easter. The sister got angry and took it to Facebook, causing some drama.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for work. She's been doing it for a long time. Her sister asked her to make a dress, but the author said no because she's busy, doesn't like sewing for others, and doesn't see the point in one-time use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate it and it's for a photo. The sister got upset, called her selfish, and compared it to other scenarios where the author would help her kids if needed. The author then suggested stores and even got defensive about the sister not learning to sew. The sister took it public on Facebook, which made the author question herself.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. The sister felt slighted because she asked for something she thought the author would do, especially given their shared sewing background. The author's reasoning is about personal time and not wanting to do things for others. But the sister's argument is about family obligations and the emotional aspect. The author's response about the sister not learning to sew might have been harsh, adding to the conflict. The sister's public shaming might be an overreaction, but the author's refusal could also be seen as selfish if the sister expected help. On the other hand, the author has a right to her time and hobby. It's a family matter, so what's reasonable? Maybe the author could have offered a compromise, like helping with a pattern or shopping, but she suggested stores instead. The sister's approach was confrontational, but the author's response might have been dismissive. I think there's nuance here. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do the dress, but maybe the way she handled it could have been better. However, the sister's public shaming is also problematic. The key is whether the author was obligated to do the dress. Since sewing is a hobby and not a service she offers, she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
