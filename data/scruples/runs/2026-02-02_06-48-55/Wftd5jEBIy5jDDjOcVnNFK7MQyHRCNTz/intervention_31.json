It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. They have a sewing hobby but don't do it for profit. Their sister asked them to sew a specific dress, and they declined for a few reasons: being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time-use items. The sister got upset, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others criticized the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid hobby and set boundaries. They explained their reasons clearly. It's their choice how to spend their time. Sewing for a child might not be worth their time if they feel it's a waste. They even suggested alternatives like stores. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially bringing in the mom's past and using the niece to cry for attention. The author didn't make the niece cry; the sister had the niece do that. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations can be important, especially around holidays. If the sister expected help and the author had the skills, maybe they should have helped. But the author didn't say they couldn't, just that they didn't want to. The sister's reaction is also excessive, using social media to shame the author. The author didn't force them to ask, so the sister taking it to Facebook complicates things.\n\nThe main points are the author's right to set boundaries and the sister's overreaction. The author isn't obligated to help just because they can. They made their reasons clear, and the sister's behavior seems more about her own expectations and social media validation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for saying no. The answer should be B (No).\n"
