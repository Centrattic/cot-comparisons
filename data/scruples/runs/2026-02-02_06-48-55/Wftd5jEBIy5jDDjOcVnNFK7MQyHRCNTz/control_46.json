It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to make an Easter dress for her niece. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author sews as a hobby, not for money, and uses it to make her own clothes. Her sister asked her to make a dress for their niece. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not liking one-time use items. She also mentioned that she finds sewing for kids a waste since they don't appreciate it. \n\nThe sister then got angry, called her selfish, and took it to social media. The author feels bad after the backlash and is questioning herself. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author has the right to say no. It's her hobby, and she's not obligated to use it for others unless there's an expectation. The sister might feel it's a family duty, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's tone might have been harsh. She said things like \"buy a sewing machine\" and mentioned the sister's past choices, which could be seen as dismissive. But even so, she had the right to refuse. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems over the top. Using social media to shame her and involving the niece to make her cry might be more about manipulation. The author's reasons for declining are valid\u2014personal time, hobby preferences, and not wanting to do something for a one-time use. \n\nThe community's reaction on Facebook might be biased, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. People have different perspectives. The key here is autonomy and respecting personal boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She had the right to decline, even if the sister didn't like it. The sister's actions were more problematic, using public shaming and involving the child. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
