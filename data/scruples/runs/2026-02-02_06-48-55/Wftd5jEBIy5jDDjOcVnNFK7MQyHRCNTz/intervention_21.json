It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister asked her to make an Easter dress for her daughter. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to do one-time use items. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it online, where others also criticized her. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about her boundaries. She's a hobby sewer, not a professional, and she's honest about not wanting to sew for others. She even offered alternatives, like suggesting shops. That seems reasonable. People have the right to set boundaries, especially with family. But why did the sister react so strongly? Maybe she felt slighted or that the author should have done it as a favor.\n\nThe sister then took it to Facebook, which is a common issue in these kinds of situations. The author might feel that her refusal was personal, but the sister framed it as something else, making the author the villain. The niece even cried, which adds emotional pressure. \n\nThe author's reasoning about time and effort is valid. Sewing a dress for a child who might not appreciate it and it's only for one occasion could be seen as a waste. But on the other hand, family traditions and expectations might play a role here. The sister might feel that it's a special event and expects help from a relative who has the skill. \n\nThe key points are whether the author was unreasonable in saying no and if she overstepped by refusing. The author didn't force the sister to do anything; she politely declined. The sister's reaction and the backlash on social media seem to be more about her own expectations and the author's refusal to meet them. The author's response about suggesting shops and the sister's past avoidance of learning to sew also shows that the author tried to be helpful but was met with resistance.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, she clearly communicated her reasons, offered alternatives, and stood by her decision. The sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional response don't necessarily make the author the one at fault. The author isn't obligated to do something she's uncomfortable with, especially as a hobby rather than a job. The sister's expectations might have been unrealistic, expecting a family member to do this as a favor without considering the time and effort involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She set boundaries, tried to be helpful, and the sister's reaction seems to stem from unmet expectations rather than any wrongdoing by the author. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
