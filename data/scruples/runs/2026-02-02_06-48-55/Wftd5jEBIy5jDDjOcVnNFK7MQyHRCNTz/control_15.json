It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's been taught by her mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author said no, explaining she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and that one-time use items aren't worth her time. She also mentions that kids don't appreciate the work and it's for a photo. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others criticized her. The niece even cried in a video. The author is now questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, to determine if she's wrong, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, family requests can be sensitive. The sister might feel that as family, the author should help, especially since she has the skill. The niece is a child, and Easter is a special occasion. The sister's frustration could be from wanting to provide something special without the hassle of buying it. Also, the author's comment about her sister not learning to sew because she preferred video games might have been harsh, possibly hurting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. Sewing is her hobby, and she's not obligated to use it for others. Her reasons for declining\u2014personal time, not wanting to sew for others, and the temporary use of the dress\u2014are valid. The sister's reaction might be over the top, especially using the niece's feelings to pressure her. The author tried to offer alternatives (shops), but the sister dismissed them. The public shaming on Facebook adds to the tension, suggesting the sister might have overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. family expectations. The author isn't in a position where she must help, but family dynamics can complicate things. The sister's approach was confrontational, and the author's response, while firm, was in her right to set her boundaries. The niece's crying in a video seems like a manipulative tactic from the sister's side, which might make the sister the one in the wrong here.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more empathetic. Instead of saying the sister should learn to sew herself, perhaps she could have offered a different form of help or explained more gently. But the core issue is her right to decline. The sister's anger and public shaming are more indicative of her own issues with boundaries and respect.\n\nSo, based on that analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. She's allowed to prioritize her own time and interests, even if it means saying no to family requests. The sister's reaction is more problematic here.\n"
