It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the author sewing as a hobby and declining a request from their sister to create a special dress for their niece.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author doesn't sew for others, doesn't enjoy it, and avoids one-time use projects. They mentioned being busy with their own wardrobe. The sister was upset, calling them selfish, and the author felt pressured. Then there's the part where the author suggested shops, which made the sister angrier. The author also confronted the sister about her past choices not to learn sewing, which might have come off as harsh.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author should have said yes to the request. The sister is using the \"Court of Public Opinion\" (like Facebook) to shame the author. The niece also cried, which is an emotional lever. The author is questioning their own actions.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to provide the dress just because they can. They have their own reasons related to their hobby and time. But family dynamics can be tricky. The sister might feel entitled because the author's mother taught them. However, the author's boundaries are about their personal time and interests. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author tried to be polite and offered alternatives. The sister's argument that \"family should do it for each other\" doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. People have different interests and priorities. The author isn't refusing to help in other ways, just this specific request. \n\nAlso, the sister's use of public shaming and the niece's emotional appeal could be seen as manipulation. The author's reasons are valid\u2014they don't enjoy sewing for others and consider it a waste of time. It's their choice to use their hobby for themselves. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The sister is asking for something that the author isn't comfortable with, even if others might not understand it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
