It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece, and the sister getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. She sews as a hobby, not for profit, and she's been doing it for a long time. She told her sister she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and doesn't like making one-time-use items. Also, she mentions that kids can ruin the dress and it's just for a photo. \n\nHer sister called her selfish and took it to Facebook, where others criticized her. The niece cried in a video. The author feels bad and is unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nI should think about boundaries. The author is within her rights to decline if it's causing her stress. Hobbies are personal, and using them for others can lead to resentment. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially using the niece's tears. The author tried to offer alternatives, which shows she's not entirely indifferent.\n\nBut family expectations might play a role. In some families, helping relatives is expected, even if it's a hobby. However, the author's reasons are valid. She's not obligated to use her time for others' requests. The sister's approach of public shaming is problematic.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to her time and boundaries versus the sister's expectations. The answer would likely be that the author isn't wrong because she's respecting her own limits. However, maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about being in the wrong. The sister's overreaction is more the issue here.\n"
