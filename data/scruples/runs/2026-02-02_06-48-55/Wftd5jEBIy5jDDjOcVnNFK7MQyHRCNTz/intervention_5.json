It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation is that the author sews as a hobby and makes their own clothes, but when their sister asked them to make a dress for her daughter, they said no. The reasons given are that they're busy with their own wardrobe, they don't enjoy sewing for others, and they don't like making one-time-use items. The sister took offense, called the author selfish, and the author ended up feeling bad after Facebook comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since sewing isn't their job but a hobby. They made it clear they don't enjoy sewing for others, which is valid. The sister's demand might be seen as expecting a favor without considering the other person's time and preferences. However, the author did suggest alternatives like buying the dress, which shows they tried to help in another way. \n\nBut there's also the part where the author thought to themselves that sewing for kids is a waste of time because the kids don't appreciate it. That's a bit harsh, even if it's a personal opinion. Maybe the sister felt it was important for the child to have a special dress for Easter, and the author's refusal came off as dismissive of that importance. The author also mentioned the sister's lack of interest in learning to sew, which could be seen as a passive-aggressive jab, maybe escalating the conflict.\n\nOn Facebook, the sister portrayed the author as selfish and the child being upset made people more sympathetic to her side. Social media can skew perspectives, often favoring emotional appeals. The author might feel wronged because their boundaries were respected, but the sister's actions made the author look bad. \n\nIs refusing a personal favor from a sibling necessarily wrong? The author isn't obligated to help, especially if it's outside their comfort zone. But the way the refusal was handled and the underlying thoughts (like calling it a waste of time) might have contributed to the sister's hurt feelings. The key here is whether the author overstepped by not helping, or if they were justified in maintaining their personal boundaries.\n\nIn many cases, family disputes like this are about differing expectations. The sister might have expected the author to fulfill the request as part of family duty, while the author sees it as a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for saying no, but perhaps could have handled the explanation more diplomatically. However, the sister's actions in using Facebook and involving the niece's emotional response might be the more problematic part. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to say no and set boundaries around their hobby. The sister's reaction and public shaming are more concerning than the author's refusal.\n"
