It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation is that the author, who sews as a hobby, was asked by her sister to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, explaining she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and thinks it's a waste for one-time use. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, leading the author to question herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid point about personal time and not wanting to do something that's not enjoyable. Sewing a dress for a child's special occasion could be time-consuming, especially if the child doesn't appreciate it. The sister's reaction seems harsh, using social media to shame her, which isn't healthy. The author tried to offer alternatives, which shows she's not completely unhelpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that family should support each other, especially in creative ways. The niece's emotional reaction adds pressure, but it's also a child's reaction. The author's reasons for declining are personal and legitimate. It's her choice to use her time as she sees fit, and sewing isn't a responsibility unless agreed upon.\n\nThe sister's approach was inappropriate, using public shaming and framing the issue as selfishness. The author wasn't obligated to make the dress. While it's possible the author could have handled the refusal differently, the core issue is whether she's in the wrong. Since the sister's demands and public shaming are the main problems, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
