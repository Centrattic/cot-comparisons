It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby, not a job, and turned down her sister's request. The sister got upset, called her selfish, took it to Facebook, and even had the niece cry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's using her hobby for personal projects and doesn't want to spend time on something for someone else, especially for a one-time event. She also mentions that she's not into sewing for others and that the effort might be wasted because kids don't appreciate it. That makes sense because hobbies are personal, and people shouldn't feel forced to use their skills for others unless they want to.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction seems harsh. She's upset because she expected her sister to help, maybe thinking it's a family obligation. But the author never promised to do this, and the sister didn't consider her sister's boundaries. The sister's response\u2014calling her selfish, using Facebook, and making the niece cry\u2014seems over the top. The author was clear about her reasons, even offering alternatives like store-bought dresses, which the sister dismissed.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to use her hobby for someone else. It's her choice how she spends her time. The sister's reaction is more about control and not respecting those boundaries. The author's reasons for saying no are valid: time, personal preference, and the practicality of the project. The sister's public shaming and involving the niece in emotional manipulation are problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her decision, gave alternatives, and had legitimate reasons. The sister's actions are the issue here, not the author's refusal. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
