It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the author, who sews as a hobby, declining a request from her sister to sew a dress for her daughter. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook, leading to more conflict. The author is now questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. She says she's busy working on her own clothes, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and dislikes making one-time use items. She also mentions that kids don't appreciate the effort. Her sister's reaction was harsh, and she felt attacked. \n\nThe sister's perspective is that the author should help family, especially since she's good at sewing. The sister's argument is that she would help the author's kids if needed, so the author should do the same. The niece's reaction (crying on video) adds emotional weight to the sister's side.\n\nLegally or morally, there's no obligation to sew for family unless there's a prior agreement. The author made it clear she doesn't enjoy sewing for others, so it's a personal choice. However, family expectations can be complex. The sister might feel that the author is being selfish, especially if they value family contributions over personal hobbies. \n\nThe author's response of suggesting shops and then telling the sister to buy a sewing machine herself might have come off as dismissive. The sister felt humiliated, and the Facebook comments amplified the sister's side. But the author isn't under any obligation to do this, so maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have offered an alternative or been more empathetic in her refusal. But the sister's anger and public shaming might be her own issue. The key here is whether the author had a right to say no. Since it's a personal choice and there's no obligation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author isn't the asshole for setting boundaries around her hobby.\n"
