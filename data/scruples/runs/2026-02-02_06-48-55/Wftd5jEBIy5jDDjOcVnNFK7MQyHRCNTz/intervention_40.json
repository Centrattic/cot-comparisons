It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about sewing an Easter dress for her niece. The author explains that sewing is a hobby, not a job, and she's been doing it for a long time. She turned down her sister's request, giving reasons like being busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to do something for a one-time use. She also mentions kids not appreciating the effort and the dress being for a photo.\n\nHer sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook, making it seem like the author was shaming her for being a feminist tomboy. The sister even had the niece cry in a video, which made the author feel bad and question herself.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's clear that sewing is her hobby, not an obligation. She's not making money from it, so there's no expectation that others should benefit from her free labor. She tried to explain her reasons, suggested alternatives (like shops), and even mentioned her sister's past choices to play games instead of learning to sew. That part could come off as a bit harsh, but maybe she felt justified.\n\nOn the sister's side, she wanted a custom dress for her daughter. It's a family request, and maybe she thought since the author can sew, it's a given. But the author isn't obligated to help unless there was prior agreement. The sister's reaction seems over the top, especially using the niece to play the victim and going public on Facebook. That looks like gaslighting or manipulating the situation to make the author look bad.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and boundaries. The author set boundaries, which is okay. People should be able to say no without guilt. However, the way she explained her reasons might have included some harsh comments (like about kids not appreciating the work), which could have been hurtful. But overall, the sister's response was more aggressive and public, which is more problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's sister's argument that she would do the same for her kids if needed seems like a false equivalence. It's about mutual expectations, but the author isn't under any obligation unless there's a prior understanding. The sister didn't learn to sew, so she can't expect the author to do it for free. The author is within her rights to decline.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her refusal, offered alternatives, and stood by her decision. The sister's response was more about taking it personally and trying to shame her. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
