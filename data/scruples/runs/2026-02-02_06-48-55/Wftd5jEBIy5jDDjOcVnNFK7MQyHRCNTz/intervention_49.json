It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author sews as a hobby, not for income. Her sister asked her to make an Easter dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to do one-time use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort, and it's for a photo. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The niece even cried on video. Now the author is questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: it's her hobby, she's not obligated to sew for others. She's clear about her boundaries. But family relationships can be tricky. The sister might feel slighted because she expected her sister to help, especially since their mom taught both of them to sew. The author's sister didn't learn, so maybe there's some resentment there. The author's response about the sister not taking the opportunity to learn could be a point of contention. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she's a perfectionist or feels the dress is important for the event. However, the author isn't required to fulfill every family request. The key here is whether the author's refusal is selfish. The author isn't refusing because of malice but because of personal boundaries. On the other hand, the niece's disappointment is real, but the author isn't the parent; the parents are responsible for their child's needs.\n\nThe author's sister brought the issue public, which might indicate she felt hurt, but using the Court of Public Opinion can be unkind. The author's response to suggest the sister learn to sew herself is a bit harsh, maybe, but it's a valid boundary. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, there's a cultural aspect where some people might expect family to help without being asked. But the author's reasons are valid. The sister's handling of the situation is problematic, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's maintaining her hobby as she wishes and isn't obligated to help. The sister's reaction is more the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
