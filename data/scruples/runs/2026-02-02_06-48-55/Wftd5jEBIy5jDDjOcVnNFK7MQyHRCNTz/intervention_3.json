It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to make their niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby, not for income, and has made their own clothes. They declined the request, giving reasons like being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not wanting to make one-time use items. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to social media, where people were critical. The niece even cried in a video.\n\nThe author's main points: It's their hobby, they have their own projects, they don't like sewing for others, and they think children's clothes aren't worth the effort since the kids won't appreciate it. The sister felt it was a simple request and that the author should have helped. The author suggested alternatives, but that backfired.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to do this. They made their stance clear. However, family dynamics can be tricky. The sister might feel entitled, especially if there's a history of such requests. The author's frustration about the purpose of the dress (for a photo) and the effort vs. appreciation is valid. But the sister's reaction might stem from feeling slighted or not being considered. The niece crying in a video could be a child's genuine disappointment, but the sister's public shaming is problematic.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had an obligation. Since it's a family matter without a prior agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their refusal politely and offered alternatives. The sister's response, including public shaming and using the niece's emotions, leans more on her being inconsiderate. The author's explanation about the effort not being worth it for a one-time use is reasonable, especially as a hobbyist. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
