It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby and said no to her sister's request, explaining she's busy, doesn't sew for others, and finds one-time use items like kids' dresses not worth the effort. The sister got mad, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook, which upset the author.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a valid point. Sewing is her hobby, and she's under no obligation to use her skills for others, especially if it's not something she enjoys or wants to do. She explained her reasons clearly and even offered alternatives by suggesting shops. That shows she tried to be helpful without agreeing to sew. The sister's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author's main argument is about personal boundaries and the value of her time. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that family obligations can sometimes require flexibility. The sister felt personally slighted, maybe expecting the author to help as part of family support. The niece being upset and the social media backlash could be seen as the sister trying to rally support, which might not be fair to the author. \n\nBut the key points here are the author's clear communication of her reasons, offering alternatives, and the sister's public shaming. The author isn't being selfish; she's setting boundaries around her hobby. The sister's reaction seems to be more about her own expectations and the public shaming rather than the author's actual wrongdoing. The niece's age and the fact that it's a one-time event also play into the author's point about the effort not being worth it. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her stance, provided alternatives, and the sister's response was more about her own feelings than the author's actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
