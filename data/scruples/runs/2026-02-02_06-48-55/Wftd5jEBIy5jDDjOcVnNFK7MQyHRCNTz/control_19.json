It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who sews as a hobby, was asked by her sister to make an Easter dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't like sewing for others, and finds one-time-use items like kids' dresses not worth the effort. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, where people criticized the author. The niece even cried in a video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's clear that sewing is a hobby for herself, not a job. She's been taught by their mom but her sister didn't take the opportunity to learn. She's being asked to spend time and effort on something she doesn't want to do, especially for a one-time event. She offered alternatives like stores, which the sister rejected. The author's reasoning is that kids don't value the work done, and it's for a photo, not the child's benefit. She also mentions that she doesn't sew for others, even for weddings, which are more significant events. That seems consistent.\n\nOn the other side, the sister is upset because she feels entitled to her sister's time and skills. She might not realize that the author's hobby isn't a service she can request. The sister's argument is that she would do the same for her kids, but she didn't learn to sew. Maybe she sees it as a family obligation or a way to bond with the niece. The sister's reaction, though, seems harsh and public shaming on Facebook. The niece's crying might be used to guilt-trip the author further.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to use her time and skills for others unless she agrees. The sister overstepped by demanding and then public shaming. The author's refusal is valid if it's her choice. However, the way the sister handled it is problematic. The author's response, suggesting the sister learn to sew herself, is a bit harsh but maybe justified given the sister's attitude. The niece's age is 9, so expecting a child to appreciate the effort is unrealistic. The dress is for a special occasion, but it's not something the author is required to do. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to say no without guilt, especially when it's a personal hobby. The sister's approach is more about her wants and not respecting the author's boundaries. The public backlash on Facebook is an example of others not understanding the nuances of the situation, adding pressure on the author. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting her limits. The sister should have understood that sewing for family isn't a given and that the author has her own priorities. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's been clear about her stance and offered alternatives. The sister's reaction is more about her own expectations and not respecting the author's choices. The answer should be B.\n"
