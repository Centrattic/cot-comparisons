It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation where they refused to sew an Easter dress for their niece. The author explains they sew as a hobby, not for others, and don't like making things for one-time use. Their sister got angry and took it to Facebook, which upset the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author uses sewing as a personal hobby, which is their choice. They made it clear they don't enjoy sewing for others and have declined similar requests before. The sister's argument is that if her kids needed something, the author would help, so she should do the same. But the author's reasoning is about their own time, effort, and the value they place on their work. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems a bit harsh. She called the author selfish and implied they're a bad sister, which is emotionally charged. Also, taking it to Facebook and involving the niece crying might be a tactic to pressure the author. The author's suggestion to buy a sewing machine and learn might have come off as dismissive, but they were standing up for their boundaries. \n\nPeople's comments on Facebook are pointing out the sister's frustration, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The author has the right to say no to requests that don't align with their personal values or time commitments. The sister's needs might be valid, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill them if they have a clear boundary. \n\nThe niece is young, and the author is concerned about the effort not being appreciated. Kids can be messy, so making a custom dress might not be practical. The author's time is their own, and they're not being compensated, so it's a personal choice. The sister's approach of public shaming could be more at fault here. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their stance, and the sister overstepped by shaming and involving the child. The answer should be B.\n"
