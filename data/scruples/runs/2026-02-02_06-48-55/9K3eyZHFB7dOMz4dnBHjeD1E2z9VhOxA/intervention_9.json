I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to trans women who still present as men. The author identifies as a lesbian and explains that they're not attracted to men or those who look like men, even if they identify as trans. They got called a TERF and kicked out of a Facebook group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider definitions. A TERF is a trans-exclusionary radical feminist, but in this context, the term is being used more broadly to describe someone who excludes trans women from the category of women they're attracted to. The author's stance is that they only want to date trans women who pass as cis women and don't mind if they have a penis, which might be okay if they don't engage in certain activities. But their issue is with presentation\u2014specifically, not being attracted to those who look like men.\n\nNow, the key question is whether not being attracted to trans women who present as men is transphobic. Transphobia involves discrimination or prejudice against trans people. If someone isn't attracted to a certain presentation style, is that transphobic? The author isn't rejecting trans women because they're trans per se, but because of their appearance, which is similar to men. However, the trans woman in the example is presenting as a man in the app, leading to the author's discomfort.\n\nThere's a difference between attraction preferences and prejudice. It's possible to have attraction preferences based on presentation without being transphobic. For example, if someone only likes feminine-presenting people, that's a preference. But the line blurs here because the trans woman is being mispresented as a man by the app, which complicates things. The author's friend argues that gender identity should matter more than presentation, which is a common argument in trans rights discussions. The author, however, prioritizes presentation and physical traits for attraction.\n\nAnother angle: the author's statement about only being attracted to trans women who \"fully pass as a girl\" and either don't mind engaging with a penis or have had surgery. This implies that their attraction is conditional on certain physical aspects, which could be seen as focusing on biological sex rather than gender identity. That might align with some trans-exclusionary views, hence the labels of TERF.\n\nBut the author isn't denying the trans woman's identity; they're saying they aren't attracted to her based on how she looks. It's a matter of personal preference versus societal expectations. The community's reaction might stem from the belief that attraction should be based on identity, not presentation. However, attraction is inherently subjective. The author's friends and the Facebook group might be conflating personal preferences with bigotry.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to have such preferences? If the author isn't discriminating against trans women in general but only those who present a certain way, is that transphobia? Or is it a matter of personal taste? The author's stance doesn't seem to be about excluding trans women as a group but specifically those who present as men. However, by focusing on presentation and physical traits, they might inadvertently contribute to stigma against trans women who don't pass as cis women, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nThe friend called them a TERF and left, but the author isn't against trans women per se, just those who look a certain way. The key point is whether the author's preference is transphobic. If the preference is based on presentation (which is a choice for trans women to present in various ways), then it's not inherently transphobic. However, if it's based on the assumption that trans women aren't \"real\" women unless they pass, that's problematic.\n\nThe author's exclusion of trans women who look like men is similar to excluding cis women who have certain traits. But because the trans women are being misgendered in the app, the author might be reacting to the male presentation rather than the trans identity. This complicates the situation. The author's friends might see this as invalidating trans women's experiences by focusing on appearance, which is a common point of conflict in discussions about trans inclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how strict the community is about attraction based on identity vs. presentation. If the community holds that attraction must be based on identity (regardless of presentation), then the author is in the wrong. However, if personal attraction preferences are seen as legitimate, then the author isn't in the wrong. The labels of TERF and the reaction from the group might be overreaching, but the author's preference does touch on contentious issues around trans inclusion. However, the author isn't denying trans women's identity, just their own attraction based on specific traits. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that their stance is controversial and could be seen as transphobic by some.\n"
