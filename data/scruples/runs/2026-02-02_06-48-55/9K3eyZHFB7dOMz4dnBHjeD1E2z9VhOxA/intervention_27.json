I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a detailed scenario where someone is questioning if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to trans women who still look like men. The person is a lesbian, and they've faced backlash for expressing this preference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. On one hand, the author is stating their personal attraction, which is subjective. They're not transphobic, just not physically attracted to people who present as men, regardless of their gender identity. On the other hand, others argue that this stance is transphobic, especially since it's based on appearance rather than identity. The term \"TERF\" is thrown around, which relates to exclusionary trans women from the category of women.\n\nI should think about the definitions. A lesbian is defined by attraction to women. If someone is a trans woman, she is a woman, so excluding her based on appearance could be seen as contradicting that definition. But attraction is personal. People can have preferences, like not being attracted to certain body types. However, the issue here is whether that preference is transphobic or just a personal choice.\n\nThe key point is that the author is not rejecting trans women based on their identity but their presentation. If they were to reject them because they don't identify as men, that might be different. But here, they're rejecting based on how they look, which is similar to how they would reject a cisgender man. However, the controversy arises because some see this as invalidating the identity of trans women, implying that only those who pass as feminine are valid. This can contribute to marginalizing trans women.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being called a TERF, which often comes from a place of defending trans women's inclusion. Labeling as TERF is harsh, but the author isn't denying trans women's identity, just attraction. However, the line between personal preference and prejudice can be thin here. If the author's stance is that they only want to date people who look a certain way, regardless of their gender identity, that's a personal choice, but when it's framed as not recognizing trans women as \"real\" women, that's problematic.\n\nI also need to consider societal context. There's a push to accept and include trans women in all aspects, including dating and relationships. Expressing a preference that excludes them based on appearance might be seen as contributing to their exclusion, even if the intent is not malicious. The author's friends might feel that such preferences reinforce stereotypes or are discriminatory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't being transphobic in the sense of denying others' identities, their preference could be seen as problematic because it's based on appearance rather than identity. However, attraction is subjective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having that preference. Some might say no, it's their right to have preferences. Others might argue that in a context where trans women are already marginalized, such preferences can be exclusionary and thus harmful. The answer depends on whether personal attraction preferences are considered acceptable, which is a nuanced debate. Given the context, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong for stating their attraction, but the situation is complex.\n"
