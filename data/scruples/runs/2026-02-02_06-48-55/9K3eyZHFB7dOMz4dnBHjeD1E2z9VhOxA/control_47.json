I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who appear masculine, and she's facing backlash for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a lesbian who prefers not to be attracted to individuals who look like men, even if they're trans women. She's being called a TERF and facing social consequences. The key points here are about attraction and identity.\n\nTERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which typically involves excluding trans women from being recognized as women. The author mentions not being attracted to trans women who look like men but doesn't necessarily deny their identity. She's focusing on physical presentation rather than identity. The question is whether her stance on attraction makes her a TERF or if she's wrong for it.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, many argue that gender identity is what matters, not physical appearance. So if someone is a trans woman, their gender identity is female, and some people believe attraction should be based on that identity regardless of presentation. However, attraction is a personal and subjective experience. It's possible to respect someone's identity while not being physically attracted to their current presentation.\n\nThe author isn't transphobic; she states she's not attracted to men or masculine-presenting people. That's about her personal preferences in partners. But when trans women are presented as women (even if they appear masculine), some might argue that the author is conflating presentation with gender identity, which could be seen as exclusionary. However, others might say that attraction is valid and personal, and as long as it's not rooted in hatred, it's okay.\n\nThe author is being called a TERF, but that term is usually associated with more systemic exclusion or denial of trans women's rights. If she's not denying their identity but just not finding them attractive, it's more about personal preference. The conflict arises from differing views on where attraction should be directed\u2014whether based on biology, presentation, or identity.\n\nIn terms of morality, being in the wrong would depend on intent. If the author is not malicious and is just sharing her attractions without judgment, she's not necessarily wrong. However, in some contexts, this can be seen as discriminatory because it might exclude trans women from the dating pool based on appearance. But again, attraction is not a moral failing unless tied to prejudice.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether personal attraction choices can be considered wrong when they don't involve active harm. Since the author isn't advocating against trans rights, merely stating her preferences, it's more about personal choice versus societal expectations. In that case, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a valid debate here.\n"
