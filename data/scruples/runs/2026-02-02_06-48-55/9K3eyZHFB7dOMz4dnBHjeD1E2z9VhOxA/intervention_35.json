I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to trans women who look like men. The author identifies as a lesbian and finds herself in a conflict where some of her LGBT friends are calling her a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and being transphobic for not wanting to date people who present as men, even if they're trans women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't opposed to trans women per se, but she's not attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. The main issue is that her friends and others in the online community are reacting negatively to her stance, accusing her of being bigoted.\n\nNow, TERF is a term used for feminists who oppose the inclusion of trans women in discussions about women's issues, often denying their identity. The author isn't denying trans women's identity; she just has a specific attraction criteria. She's not saying trans women aren't women, but rather that she's not attracted to those who have a male presentation.\n\nThe question is whether her preference makes her in the wrong. On one hand, personal attraction is subjective, and people often have preferences about physical appearance. It's not uncommon for people to be attracted to certain looks. So, the author isn't wrong in terms of her personal preferences. However, the problem arises when those preferences are framed as a judgment against trans women or if they contribute to transphobia.\n\nBut the author is clear that she's not transphobic; she's just not attracted to men-looking people. The issue is that some might view this as problematic because it reduces the validity of trans women's identities if they are perceived as male-presenting. However, trans women are women regardless of how they present, so the author's lack of attraction based on presentation doesn't negate their identity. The problem is more about how her stance is interpreted by others.\n\nThe friends and community are reacting because they see her as excluding trans women by not being open to dating them if they don't pass as feminine. But the author is not saying trans women aren't real; she's just stating her personal preferences. However, in the context of being part of the LGBT community, there's an expectation to support inclusivity, and some might see her stance as not aligning with that, even if unintended.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having her preferences, but the way others perceive her stance could be where the conflict lies. The key is whether her preferences are based on transphobia or just personal attraction. Since she's not denying their identity and it's about presentation, it's more about personal choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because personal attraction preferences are valid, even if others disagree.\n"
