I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to trans women who look like men. The author identifies as a lesbian and is facing backlash for this stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. A lesbian is a woman whose romantic and sexual attractions are to other women. The key here is understanding the author's attraction to gender identity versus physical presentation. The author isn't attracted to people who look like men, including trans women who have not fully transitioned to a more feminine appearance. \n\nThe author's friend and others are accusing her of being a TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. This term is used to describe feminists who exclude trans women from the women's community, which the author denies. The author clarifies that she isn't transphobic but simply isn't attracted to those who present as male. She also mentions she dates butch girls as long as they have some feminine traits, which complicates her stance because she is open to butch presentation but not to those who look like men, which might be a line she's trying to draw.\n\nNow, the question is whether her being in the wrong depends on the definitions of lesbianism and the inclusion of trans women. Some argue that a lesbian is someone attracted to women, which includes trans women since their gender identity is female. Others, like the author, might define it based on physical presentation, leading to conflict. \n\nThe author isn't making a political statement but stating her personal attraction. The issue arises when others claim her stance is transphobic or exclusionary. However, attraction is subjective and personal. While her views might conflict with certain social or political ideals, she isn't expressing hatred or discrimination; she's just not finding people who look a certain way attractive. \n\nThe backlash she's receiving from friends and groups might be due to the current social climate where being inclusive is prioritized. But labeling her as a TERF or being kicked out of groups for her personal preferences could be an overreaction. It's possible that she's being judged for her personal tastes in a way that's not fair, as attraction isn't something one can control. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If she's rejecting trans women because they were assigned male at birth or have a penis, that could be seen as a problem. But if it's purely based on how they present, which isn't under the trans women's control (if they're passing), then it's more about appearance. The author's admission that she only dates trans women who pass and don't mind her not engaging with a penis adds another layer. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's views might not align with certain progressive ideals, her stance is about personal attraction, which is subjective. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong for her personal preferences, though the situation is complex and can be seen through different lenses.\n"
