I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as a lesbian and is not attracted to trans women who look like men. She got into an argument with her friend, who called her a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist), and now she's facing backlash from her LGBTQ+ friends and being banned from a Facebook group. The key issue here is about attraction and how that affects one's identity as a lesbian.\n\nFrom what I know, the term \"TERF\" is often used to describe feminists who exclude trans women from the definition of women, which can be transphobic. But the author isn't necessarily saying that trans women aren't women; she's just stating her personal attraction. However, the friend interpreted her stance as excluding trans women from being women, hence the label. \n\nThe author's main point is that she's not attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. She's not denying trans women's identities but is expressing her own preferences in attraction. But the problem comes when others see this as transphobic. The friend and others might argue that attraction should be based on identity, not appearance, which is a common debate in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to their own attractions and preferences. No one is obligated to be attracted to anyone. On the other hand, by using terms like \"trans women who look like men,\" she might be inadvertently reinforcing the idea that a person's appearance is more important than their identity. This can be problematic because it can lead to invalidating the experiences of trans women who may face discrimination based on appearance, not just identity.\n\nThe author's statement about only being attracted to people who \"fully pass as a girl\" and her conditions about surgery or not engaging with a penis could be seen as placing unnecessary burdens on trans women to conform to certain standards to be considered attractive. This might contribute to transphobia by implying that trans women are not valid unless they look a certain way, which is a harmful stereotype.\n\nHowever, she's not denying trans women their identity; she's just expressing her own preferences. The line between personal preference and prejudice can be blurry here. The friend's reaction might be more about the way the author framed her preferences rather than the preferences themselves. The author's friends might feel that by not engaging with trans women unless they meet certain criteria, she's excluding them based on physical traits, which can be seen as transphobic, even if that's not her intention.\n\nIn terms of the question: Is she in the wrong? If we consider that being transphobic means denying someone's identity or rights, she's not doing that. She's just stating her attraction preferences. However, if her preferences contribute to a culture that undermines trans women's validity, then it could be seen as problematic. The challenge is that personal attraction is subjective, but how you express it can affect others' perceptions and experiences.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal attraction preferences, when expressed in a way that prioritizes appearance over identity, are considered in the wrong. The author isn't necessarily transphobic, but her statements might be interpreted as such, leading to the backlash she's experiencing. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong in terms of her personal feelings, but in how she communicates them, she might be contributing to a transphobic narrative unintentionally.\n"
