I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author identifies as a lesbian and has re-downloaded Bumble after a recent breakup. They mention that sometimes the app shows them male profiles despite the \"only women\" setting. When a friend swiped through the app and found a trans woman (Jacob) who looks male, the author expressed not being attracted to them, leading to a conflict where the friend called them a TERF and transphobic. The author is now confused and asking if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a TERF is. TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. It's a term used for feminists who are transphobic, particularly in the context of transgender women. But the author says they're not transphobic, just not attracted to people who look like men. However, the trans woman in question, Jacob, is presenting as a man in the photos. The author's friend argues that the gender identity matters more than the presentation, but the author's preference is based on appearance, which contradicts the idea that gender identity is the key factor for many in the trans community.\n\nNow, the core issue here is attraction based on gender presentation versus gender identity. The author is honest about their preferences, but their friend and others are upset because they're excluding trans women who may not \"pass\" as female. The author's statement that they only date trans women who have had surgery and \"fully pass\" as girls is where the problem might lie. This could be seen as invalidating a trans woman's identity just because she doesn't look like a cisgender woman. The friend's argument is that a \"real lesbian\" should be okay with this because it's about gender identity, not appearance. \n\nBut the author is making a distinction based on how others present themselves. If a trans woman has not undergone surgery and still looks male, the author isn't attracted to her. This could be misinterpreted as transphobia, especially since some people believe that attraction should be based on gender identity regardless of physical appearance. However, the author isn't denying the trans woman's identity, just stating their own lack of attraction. \n\nThe line between personal preference and prejudice is thin here. While it's true that people can have preferences in their attraction, the term \"TERF\" is specifically about excluding trans women from being considered women. If the author is rejecting trans women solely because they don't look feminine, that might be seen as transphobic, even if it's a personal choice. However, if they're considering that this person is a man in appearance (regardless of identity), then it's a matter of self-awareness about their own attractions. \n\nBut the key point is that the trans woman is transitioning or has a specific presentation. The author is not judging her identity but her appearance. Still, in the broader context of the LGBTQ+ community, there's a push to recognize and respect gender identity over presentation. The author's preference might be seen as trans-exclusionary if it's based on the assumption that trans women aren't women if they don't pass. \n\nThe author's friend reacted strongly, indicating that such preferences can be harmful, even if unintentionally. The author's own statement about not dating butch girls unless they look feminine in some way might also show a preference for traditional femininity, which could be problematic in a community that values diverse expressions of gender. \n\nSo, the author isn't denying the trans woman's identity but is making a decision based on appearance, which some might see as discriminatory. The question is whether this is wrong. If being a lesbian is defined strictly as being attracted to cisgender women, then the author's preference could be considered in line with that. But if the community's view is that lesbianism includes attraction to all women, including trans women, then the author is excluding trans women based on appearance, which some would find transphobic. \n\nThe author is being accused of being a TERF, which typically involves more than just personal preference. However, the author's stance might align with a more exclusionary view. The problem is that their preference is causing harm by invalidating the trans woman's existence as a woman. Even if it's a personal choice, the backlash comes from the perception that it's contributing to transphobic attitudes. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being attracted to people who look like men, but the way they express that preference, especially if it's based on the assumption that trans women must pass as female to be valid, could be seen as transphobic. Therefore, their actions might be considered in the wrong in this context.\n"
