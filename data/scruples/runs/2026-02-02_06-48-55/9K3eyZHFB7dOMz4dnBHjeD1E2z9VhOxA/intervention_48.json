I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is a lesbian who's not attracted to transgender women who look masculine, like men. They got into an argument with a friend who called them a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and other friends are upset, even kicking them out of a group. The author is confused because they don't think they're transphobic, just not attracted to people who look like men. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the definitions. A TERF is someone who excludes trans women from being considered women, often with a feminist stance. The author isn't denying trans women's identity; they're just not attracted to them based on appearance. They mention that they would date trans women who pass as feminine and don't have a penis, so it's more about presentation than gender identity. But the friend is calling them a TERF, which implies exclusion based on gender identity. The author is being accused of transphobia, but they claim it's about attraction, not identity.\n\nNext, the key points here are about attraction versus identity. The author isn't rejecting trans women as women, just stating their personal preference. However, the friend and others argue that gender identity matters more than presentation. It's a common debate in LGBTQ+ communities. Some people believe that attraction should be based on gender identity regardless of presentation, while others (like some cisgender lesbians) are attracted to presentation rather than identity.\n\nThe author's friends are upset because they might view the author's stance as transphobic, even if that's not the author's intention. The line between being honest about attraction and being transphobic can be blurry. The author isn't saying trans women aren't women, just that they aren't attracted to trans women who present as men. But the term \"TERF\" is often used pejoratively for those who exclude trans women from being women, which the author isn't doing directly. However, the exclusion of trans women who pass as men might still be seen as transphobic because it's based on their physical characteristics rather than identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their preferences. They're not forcing anyone to accept their views, just explaining why they swipe left. The problem arises when their personal preference is framed as a judgment against trans women, which can contribute to marginalization. The author might not be intentionally transphobic, but the effect of their actions could be harmful by reinforcing stereotypes that trans women aren't \"real\" women if they don't present femininely.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's complicated. If they are genuinely not transphobic but have specific attraction criteria, they might not be the asshole. However, the way they express their preferences and the impact on trans women's acceptance could be problematic. The key is whether their stance upholds harmful stereotypes or if it's just personal preference. Since they don't deny the identity of trans women but base attraction on appearance, it's more about personal preference. But in the context of the community, this can still be seen as exclusionary and contribute to transphobic attitudes, even unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be intentionally transphobic, their stance can be perceived as such, leading to the conflict. The answer depends on whether transphobia is defined by intent or impact. Since the impact can be harmful, some might say the author is in the wrong. Others might say it's personal choice. But given the community's perspective, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
