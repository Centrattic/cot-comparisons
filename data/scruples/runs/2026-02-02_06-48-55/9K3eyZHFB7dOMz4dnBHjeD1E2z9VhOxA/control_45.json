I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men and got called a TERF and kicked out of a group for that. The question is if she's wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't attracted to people who present as men, even if they're trans women. She clarified she's not transphobic, just not attracted to that. Her friends and some online communities are upset, labeling her a TERF and saying she's not a \"real lesbian.\" \n\nTERF is a term used to accuse people of transphobia. The author isn't saying trans women aren't women, but she's stating her attraction is based on presentation and not having a penis. She's not denying their identity, just not being attracted to those physical traits. \n\nNext, the concept of attraction varies. Some people have preferences based on presentation, others don't. The issue here might be whether her preference is valid. The friends argue that a \"real lesbian\" wouldn't care about presentation, only gender identity. But attraction is subjective. \n\nHowever, the problem arises when her preferences lead to exclusion or discrimination. If she's not actively excluding trans women but just stating her preferences, then maybe she's not wrong. But the way she's been labeled and the backlash could be because of how her statements are framed. \n\nAlso, the author mentions she doesn't date butch girls unless they look feminine. This might imply that her criteria are about femininity rather than gender identity, which could intersect with transphobia if butch lesbians are seen as not feminine enough. But she clarifies that butch girls who are still feminine are okay. \n\nThe main ethical question is if it's wrong to have personal attraction preferences. If the author isn't denying trans women's identities or promoting harm, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the term \"TERF\" is often used to accuse people who exclude trans women from women's spaces or identities. She's not doing that; she's just stating her own preferences. \n\nBut the problem might be the condescension or the judgment from others. If her friends are upset because they believe all women, regardless of presentation, should be accepted, then there's a clash of values. It's possible that while she's not wrong for having preferences, the way she's phrased her reasons might come off as dismissive of trans women's experiences. \n\nIn conclusion, she's not acting out of transphobia but based on her own attraction. Unless she's actively harming others or denying their identity, she isn't in the wrong for her personal preferences. The answer leans towards B (not wrong), but it's nuanced because of how others perceive it.\n"
