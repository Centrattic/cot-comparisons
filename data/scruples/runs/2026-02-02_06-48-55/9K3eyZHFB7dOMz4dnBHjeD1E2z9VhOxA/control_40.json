I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to MTF (male-to-female) transgender individuals who still look like men. She's facing backlash from friends and online communities, being called a TERF and transphobic. The core issue here is about the intersection of sexual attraction, gender identity, and community standards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is not transphobic but states she isn't attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. She's being criticized for not finding trans women attractive if they don't pass as female. The term TERF is thrown around, which typically refers to someone who opposes transgender women's inclusion in women-only spaces, but the author isn't making that claim. She's just stating her personal attraction preferences.\n\nNow, considering the definitions: TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, but the author doesn't mention exclusion from spaces. She's talking about her own lack of attraction. The main question is whether having a preference for partners who don't look like men makes her wrong, especially when others label her negatively.\n\nFrom a personal autonomy standpoint, people have the right to their own sexual preferences. The author isn't discriminating based on gender identity but on physical appearance. However, the trans community might feel that focusing on presentation over identity is harmful, as it can contribute to invalidating trans women's identities. But if the author is open to dating trans women who pass as women, does that change things?\n\nThe author's friend argues that a \"real lesbian\" wouldn't have such criteria, implying that sexual orientation shouldn't be based on appearance. But heterosexuality is often defined by attraction to the opposite sex, regardless of their appearance. So, can a lesbian have preferences about how their partners present? That's a nuance here.\n\nSocially, the LGBTQ+ community often emphasizes the importance of respecting gender identity over presentation. So, if someone identifies as a woman, some people might argue they should be treated as such, regardless of appearance. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing presentation over identity, which might be considered transphobic or TERF by some, even if not intended.\n\nHowever, the author is clear that she's not transphobic and only has issues with presentation. She's not denying the trans woman's identity but is stating her personal lack of attraction. So, is it wrong to have such a preference? It's a matter of perspective. Personal attraction can be based on various factors, including appearance. But in the context of the community's values, this might be frowned upon because it could contribute to marginalizing trans women who don't pass.\n\nThe challenge is balancing personal preferences with social inclusivity. The author's friends might feel that by not being attracted to trans women who don't pass, she's contributing to their exclusion and reinforcing stereotypes. On the other hand, the author is expressing her genuine feelings and isn't denying others their identity.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the framework used. If the focus is on respecting personal autonomy and attraction, then she's not wrong. If the focus is on the social impact and inclusivity within the LGBTQ+ community, there might be valid criticism. However, the author isn't actively harming trans people by expressing her preferences, even if others find it problematic. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, but it's a complex issue with valid points on both sides.\n"
