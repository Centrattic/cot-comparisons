I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who identifies as a lesbian and isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men. The main conflict is that their friends are calling them a TERF and transphobic, but the author is just being honest about their attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the core issue is. The author isn't opposed to trans women as people, but they aren't physically attracted to those who don't pass as feminine. The friends are upset because, in their view, the author is making a value judgment based on appearance, which could be seen as transphobic. The author argues that attraction is subjective and that they're not trying to harm anyone, just being honest about their preferences.\n\nNow, considering the definitions: TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which often involves opposing the inclusion of trans women in women's spaces. The author isn't necessarily opposing that; they're just stating their attraction. So maybe being called a TERF is a mischaracterization. However, the line is thin here. If the author is saying that they can only accept trans women who have undergone surgery and don't mind engaging in penis-related sex, that could imply that they don't fully accept trans women as women unless they meet certain physical criteria. That might be seen as excluding trans women who don't fit those standards, which could align with transphobic views.\n\nOn the other hand, attraction is personal. People can have preferences about physical appearance. The issue becomes whether those preferences contribute to a transphobic attitude. If the author is not denying the validity of trans women's identities but just isn't attracted to those who don't pass as feminine, is that transphobia? Or is it just a personal preference, similar to not being attracted to butch women?\n\nThe friends argue that a \"real lesbian\" wouldn't care about presentation, only gender identity. But gender identity and presentation can vary. If the author is not attracted to a trans woman who presents as masculine, that's a personal choice, but if they're refusing to accept trans women as part of the community or as women, that's different. The author says they only date trans women who pass as girls and have had surgery, which might suggest they're making a distinction based on physical traits rather than identity.\n\nAlso, the author's friend called them out, leading to being kicked out of the group. That shows that some in the community see this as a problem. But others might say that attraction is natural and not a choice. The key question is whether the author's stance harms trans women or contributes to their marginalization. If the author isn't being hostile but just isn't interested, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if their stance implies that trans women aren't valid unless they meet certain criteria, that's more problematic.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the difference between personal attraction (which is okay) and making a value judgment that trans women aren't real women unless they look a certain way (which isn't). The author's comment about needing surgery and not wanting to engage with a penis might imply that they don't see trans women who haven't transitioned fully as women, which could be transphobic. But if they do accept trans women's identities but just have specific attraction preferences, then they're not in the wrong. However, the term \"passing\" and the emphasis on presentation might be problematic, as it can reinforce stereotypes that trans women need to present a certain way to be accepted.\n"
