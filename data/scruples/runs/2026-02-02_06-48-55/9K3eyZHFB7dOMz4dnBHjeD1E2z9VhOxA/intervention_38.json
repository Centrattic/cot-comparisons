I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman identifying as a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look masculine. She's faced backlash for stating her preferences, being called a terf, and excluded from a group. The key points here are about attraction, identity, and the dynamics within the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is that she's not attracted to people who look like men, which includes some trans women who haven't fully passed as women. She clarifies she's not transphobic but just not sexually attracted to that presentation. Her friends and others are upset, labeling her a terf and excluding her.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The author isn't denying the validity of trans women's identity; she's expressing her personal attraction preferences. However, the term \"terf\" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) is a loaded term, and being called that often relates to exclusion based on ideology rather than just attraction. The key here is whether her preference equates to transphobia or exclusion. \n\nIn many cases, personal attraction based on presentation (like not being attracted to certain body types or styles) is a personal choice and not inherently discriminatory. However, in the context of the LGBTQ+ community, there's a strong emphasis on inclusivity and recognizing gender identity beyond physical presentation. If the author's stance leads to invalidating the experiences of trans women or contributing to a hostile environment, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the author isn't making a political statement or refusing to accept trans women's identities. She's simply stating her sexual preferences. However, the community might feel that by excluding trans women who don't present femininely, she's perpetuating stereotypes or contributing to marginalization. The line between personal preference and discrimination can be blurry here.\n\nThe author's friends and the group might argue that attraction shouldn't be based on presentation but on identity. However, attraction is subjective and varies from person to person. The author isn't denying the trans women's identity but their physical presentation affects her attraction. \n\nSo, the question is whether her personal preference, even if it's based on appearance, is wrong. If she's not transphobic and is respectful of trans women's identities, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her stance leads to harmful attitudes or exclusionary behavior, then she might be. The key is that she's not being asked to change her preferences but to recognize that her preferences might impact others' perceptions and experiences.\n"
