I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who haven't fully transitioned or passed as women, especially if they still have masculine features. She got into an argument with a friend who called her a TERF and transphobic, and now she's confused about her own stance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't being attracted to trans women who don't look feminine. Her argument is that she's not attracted to people who look like men, not that she's opposed to trans women in general. She's not transphobic, she says, just not attracted to that presentation. But others are calling her out for being a TERF, which is a term used for people who exclude trans women from being women, often in a harmful way.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's expressing her personal preference about attraction, which is a valid thing. People have different attractions, and that's part of identity. On the other hand, the term TERF is loaded and usually refers to someone who denies the validity of trans women's identities, not just their attraction. If the author is okay with trans women who pass as women but not those who don't, that might not necessarily make her a TERF, but it could be seen as transphobic if she's making a judgment based on their appearance rather than their identity.\n\nHer friend and others might argue that by focusing on appearance, she's reinforcing harmful stereotypes and that her behavior contributes to marginalizing trans women. They might say that being a lesbian is about being attracted to women regardless of their physical presentation. The author's stance could be seen as exclusionary and harmful, even if it's not intended that way.\n\nBut then again, attraction is subjective. The author isn't denying trans women's identities; she's just being honest about her preferences. The issue is whether personal preference crosses into prejudice. If she's open to trans women who meet her criteria, maybe it's not inherently wrong. However, the way the situation is framed, her friend and others are reacting negatively, suggesting that in some communities, this viewpoint is considered problematic or exclusionary.\n\nThe key here is the intent and the impact. The author's intent is to be honest about her attraction but without being transphobic. The impact is that others feel she's being exclusionary. The line between personal preference and transphobia can be blurry. Some might say that as long as she's not denying trans women's identities, she's not a TERF, but her exclusion based on appearance could still be seen as transphobic if it's based on stereotypes about how women should look.\n\nIn terms of the broader context, TERF is a controversial term. Some use it to accuse anyone who isn't fully inclusive of trans women, while others argue that personal preferences about attraction are different from systemic exclusion. The author's friends might be conflating her personal preferences with political views, which complicates things.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on whether the author's stance is seen as a personal preference or a harmful exclusion. If she's not denying trans women's identities and is only expressing her own attraction criteria, she might not be in the wrong. However, if her stance contributes to marginalizing trans women by emphasizing appearance over identity, then some might argue she is in the wrong. The situation is nuanced, but given the community's reactions, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong because her preferences could be contributing to a transphobic environment, even if unintentionally.\n"
