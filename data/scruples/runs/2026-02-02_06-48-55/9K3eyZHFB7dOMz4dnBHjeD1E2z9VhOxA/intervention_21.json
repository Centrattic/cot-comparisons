I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the problem again. The user is a lesbian who's using a dating app like Bumble. They mentioned that sometimes people who are marked as women turn out to look like men, and they get annoyed. Their friend said they should swipe right on a trans woman who looks like a man (Jacob) because of shared interests, but the author isn't attracted to people who look like men. The friend called them a TERF and left, and now the author is being criticized in their LGBTQ+ group. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is not attracted to people who look like men, including trans women who haven't fully transitioned or presented in a feminine way. The friend and others are upset, arguing that gender identity matters more than presentation. The author is being accused of transphobia and being a TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. \n\nSo, the main issue is the author's attraction criteria versus the community's views on inclusivity. The author isn't denying the person's identity, just their own attraction. They stated they're not transphobic, just not attracted to men or people who look like men. The problem arises when the author's personal preference is conflated with transphobia. \n\nI should consider the difference between personal attraction and prejudice. The author is honest about their preferences, which might be based on how they perceive gender presentation. Some people in the LGBTQ+ community might argue that being a lesbian is about being attracted to women regardless of their appearance, but others might say that it's okay to have personal preferences as long as they don't harm the individual. \n\nAlso, the term TERF is often used to describe someone who excludes trans women from the community, which the author might be doing by not being open to dating trans women who present as masculine. The author's initial reaction to call the person a man before seeing their bio could be seen as lacking understanding, but they corrected themselves when they realized the person was a trans woman. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, but the author isn't actively discriminating against trans women by rejecting Jacob just because he's trans. They're stating their lack of attraction to someone who looks like a man. The issue is whether this preference is acceptable. \n\nIn terms of the community's standards, there's a movement towards inclusivity, respecting trans identities, and not making assumptions based on appearance. However, personal attraction can be subjective. The author might be in a minority of lesbians who prioritize presentation, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. \n\nBut the author is being kicked out of a group for their preferences, which is a social consequence. The question is whether the author's preferences are transphobic or just personal. The author isn't denying the person's identity; they're just not attracted to someone with that presentation. \n\nOn the other hand, the argument that a \"real lesbian\" wouldn't care about presentation is a social construct. The author's own definition of a lesbian might be based on attraction to women as they perceive them, which is a valid self-identification for them. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal attraction preferences based on gender presentation are considered wrong, especially in a context where trans individuals are being included. The author isn't making a statement about trans women being less valid, just that they aren't personally attracted to someone who presents as masculine. However, the way it's framed could be seen as excluding trans women who don't present femininely, hence the TERF label. \n\nI think there's a nuance here. The author isn't being directly transphobic by making a derogatory comment, but their preference might be excluding trans women from their dating pool based on appearance, which some might find problematic. The initial comment about Bumble showing men could be seen as a complaint about not filtering properly, but when the person's identity is known, it's about their own attraction. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions are about their personal preferences, but the community might expect more openness. However, attraction is personal, and unless they're attacking the person or denying their identity, they might not be in the wrong. But the term TERF is used when someone excludes trans women from the community, which the author might be doing by not being attracted to them when they present as men. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit of both. The author isn't necessarily being transphobic, but their preferences align with trans-exclusionary views in some aspects. However, the author isn't stating that trans women aren't women, just that their attraction is based on presentation. The initial comment about calling them a man could be seen as careless, but they corrected themselves. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether their preference is transphobic. Since they're not denying the person's identity, just their own attraction, it's a personal preference. But the way it's expressed and the resulting exclusion might be seen as harmful. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because their preference contributes to a transphobic environment, or B (no, not in the wrong) because attraction is personal. The community's reaction is about inclusivity, but the author's stance is on their own attractions. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (no), because personal attraction is a matter of individual preference and the author isn't making a statement about the person's validity as a woman. They're just not attracted to them based on appearance. However, the term TERF is more about excluding trans women from the community, not just personal dating preferences. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their friend and others are overreacting. \n\nBut some might argue that being a lesbian is about attraction to women as a gender, not just appearance. If the author is defining a woman by appearance, that's excluding trans women who might not present as such. But the author is using the term \"trans girl\" and corrected their friend, which shows they do acknowledge the identity. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for not being attracted to people who look like men, trans or not. Their preference is personal, and as long as they're respectful and don't act on potentially harmful stereotypes, it's not necessarily transphobic. The friends might be conflating their personal preference with exclusion based on gender identity. \n\nFinal answer: B\n"
