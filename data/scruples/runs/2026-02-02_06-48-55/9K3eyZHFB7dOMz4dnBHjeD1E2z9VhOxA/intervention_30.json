I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation presented is in the wrong. The scenario involves a self-identified lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who haven't fully transitioned, especially those who look more like men. She's facing backlash from friends and online communities, being labeled a \"TERF\" and kicked out of groups.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is clear that they are not attracted to trans women who present as men. They argue that their orientation is based on physical presentation and attraction, not transphobia. However, others are accusing her of being transphobic and not a \"real\" lesbian. The question is whether her stance makes her the asshole or if she's justified.\n\nTERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which is a term often used for feminists who exclude trans women from being part of the women's community. The author isn't necessarily a feminist, but the label is being thrown at her. She's being called a TERF for expressing her lack of attraction to trans women who haven't fully transitioned.\n\nNow, I need to consider the nuances. Attraction based on presentation is a personal preference. However, the issue arises when this preference is framed as a rejection of trans women as women. The author states she's not transphobic but just not attracted to men or those who look like men. However, trans women are women, and their gender identity is separate from their physical appearance. If the author's criteria for attraction is based on physical presentation rather than gender identity, this could be seen as transphobic because it dismisses the validity of trans women who haven't passed as cis women.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's exclusion of trans women from her attraction is a matter of orientation or transphobia. Some argue that sexual orientation can be based on physical characteristics, but when it leads to the exclusion of trans people from the category of women, it can be problematic. The author's friends and the community she's part of see her stance as harmful because it contributes to the erasure and invalidation of trans women.\n\nAlso, the term \"real lesbian\" is being used by others, which is a contentious point. The author is being told that her preference disqualifies her from identifying as a lesbian. This is a debate within the LGBTQ+ community about the definition of lesbianism. Some argue that a lesbian is a woman attracted to women, regardless of physical presentation, while others, especially those with trans-exclusionary views, may define it differently. However, the broader community often includes trans women under the umbrella of \"women,\" so rejecting them can be seen as exclusionary.\n\nThe author's justification is that she's not transphobic, just not attracted to men. But trans women are not men; they are women with male anatomy. The author's criteria of only being attracted to those who \"fully pass\" as women can be seen as transphobic because it invalidates trans women's identities and experiences.\n\nIn terms of societal context, there's a significant push for trans inclusion, and policies that exclude trans people from being recognized as their gender can be harmful. The author's stance, while based on personal attraction, may contribute to a hostile environment for trans individuals. Even if it's not malicious, it can be harmful.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because her preference is leading her to exclude trans women from her definition of women for attraction, which is a form of transphobia. It's not just about her personal orientation but how that orientation is framed in a way that denies the identity of trans women.\n"
