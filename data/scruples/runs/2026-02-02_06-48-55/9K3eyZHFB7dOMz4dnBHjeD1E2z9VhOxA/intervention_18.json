I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author identifies as a lesbian and has been using Bumble. They\u2019re not attracted to MTF trans women who look like men, and this caused conflict with a friend. The friend called them a TERF, and they got banned from a Facebook group. The author feels their preferences are valid, saying they\u2019re not transphobic, just not into men or people who look like men. They\u2019re confused because their LGBT friends are upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's stance is about personal attraction based on presentation. They\u2019re not transphobic, but they\u2019re not attracted to trans women who don't fully pass as women. The friend and others are labeling them as a TERF, which is a term used to criticize those who exclude trans women from being recognized as women in certain contexts, especially in feminist or LGBT circles.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author is expressing their personal preferences. Their attraction is to people who look like girls, and they\u2019re not willing to engage with someone who has a penis (even if it's a trans woman who hasn't had surgery). On the other hand, the friend and others are arguing that the author should focus on gender identity rather than presentation, and that being a \"real lesbian\" shouldn't exclude trans women regardless of their appearance.\n\nI need to consider the context of the term \"TERF.\" It's often used to accuse people of excluding trans women from being recognized as women. The author's statement about only being attracted to trans women who \"fully pass\" and don't mind them not engaging with a penis might be seen as excluding trans women based on their physical characteristics, not their identity. However, the author is clear that they are not transphobic; they\u2019re just stating their attraction preferences.\n\nThe friend's reaction might be more about the perceived exclusion rather than the author's intent. The author isn't denying the person's identity but is stating that their attraction isn't there because of the person's appearance. However, in some communities, this can be seen as problematic because it emphasizes presentation over identity.\n\nI should also think about the difference between attraction to gender identity versus physical presentation. Some people identify as homosexual based on gender identity, while others are attracted to physical traits. The author seems to be the latter. The term \"lesbian\" can be contested in this context. If the author defines a lesbian as someone who is attracted to women (in terms of identity), then trans women are included. If they define it based on physical traits (female body), then trans women might be excluded. However, the author is not denying the trans woman's identity but the physical presentation.\n\nThe friend and others might be arguing that being a \"real lesbian\" should include trans women regardless of appearance, but the author's perspective is about personal attraction. The author isn't making a political statement but stating their preferences. However, the way it's framed can come off as excluding trans women, leading to the TERF label.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance is about personal preference. It's not illegal or inherently harmful, but it can be seen as not aligning with certain community standards. The conflict arises from differing views on what defines a lesbian and the importance of identity versus presentation. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their personal preferences, but they might be in the wrong in terms of causing offense or not aligning with group norms. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for their preference, not for the consequences of their actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for having personal attraction preferences. However, the social consequences (being called a TERF, kicked out of a group) might be due to the sensitivity of the topic rather than their actual actions being objectively wrong. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because personal attraction preferences are subjective, and the author isn't being transphobic. The issue is more about differing viewpoints within the community rather than the author being in the wrong.\n"
