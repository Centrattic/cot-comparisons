I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who identifies as a lesbian, not being attracted to trans women who still look masculine. The key points here are about personal attraction, transphobia, and the use of terms like TERF.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's clear that she's not transphobic and just isn't attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. She's facing backlash from friends and communities, being called a TERF and kicked out of groups. The question is whether her stance is wrong.\n\nTERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which typically refers to people who exclude trans women from being women. But the author here isn't denying trans women's identity; she's just stating her attraction is based on appearance. So maybe being labeled a TERF is unfair here.\n\nNext, the ethical and social aspects. Attraction is subjective, and people have varying preferences. However, the issue arises when those preferences lead to exclusion or discrimination. The author isn't advocating against trans rights but is being criticized for her personal preferences. The line between personal preference and transphobia can be blurry. Some might argue that focusing on appearance rather than identity is problematic, while others see it as a legitimate personal choice.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction might be influenced by the current climate where trans rights are under discussion. The author's friends might view any exclusion of trans women as supporting harmful narratives, even if it's about attraction. The author's own friends calling her a TERF and kicking her out could be an overreaction, but it's part of the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any laws or ethical codes by stating her preferences. However, in the context of community standards and the importance of inclusivity, her stance might be seen as exclusionary, even if unintentional. The challenge is balancing personal attraction with respect for trans individuals' identities.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for her personal preferences, but the way her preferences are framed might cause unintended harm or exclusion. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, and since she's not acting with malice, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
