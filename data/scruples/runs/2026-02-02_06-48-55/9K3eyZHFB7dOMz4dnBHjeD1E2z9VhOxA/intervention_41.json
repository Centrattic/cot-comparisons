I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look masculine, like men. She's being called a TERF and transphobic by her friends. So, the question is whether her stance makes her the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't being transphobic in intent. She's saying she's not attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. But her friends are upset because they believe that gender identity is what matters, not appearance. The author is being accused of TERFism, which is a term often used for feminists who exclude or oppose trans women.\n\nNow, considering the definitions: TERF can be a slur, but the term generally refers to people who exclude trans women from being recognized as women. If the author is excluding trans women from her attraction based on their appearance, does that make her a TERF? Well, it's possible that she's not trying to exclude trans women as a group, but rather not finding certain presentations attractive. However, if she's only attracted to trans women who pass as feminine and not those who are more masculine, that could be seen as transphobic, because it's making their validity as women contingent on their appearance.\n\nBut the author clarifies that she's not transphobic. She's just not attracted to men or people who look like men. The problem here is the conflation between gender identity and appearance. Even if someone is a woman (trans or cis), if she looks masculine, the author isn't attracted to her. That could be problematic because it's not about the person's identity but their presentation. However, attraction is personal, and people can have preferences based on presentation. The issue is whether that preference is considered transphobic.\n\nIn some perspectives, being a lesbian is about being attracted to women, regardless of their appearance. So if a trans woman is a woman, then being attracted to her is part of being a lesbian. However, if someone isn't attracted to trans women because they look masculine, does that make them not a \"real\" lesbian? That's where the conflict arises. The author's friends are saying that a \"real\" lesbian wouldn't care about presentation, which is a contentious point.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's preferences are transphobic. If she's not denying the gender identity of trans women but simply finds that she isn't attracted to those who look more masculine, it's a matter of personal preference. However, in the context of the community, some might see this as harmful because it invalidates trans women's experiences by requiring them to conform to certain appearance standards to be considered attractive. That could contribute to stigma against trans women who don't pass as feminine.\n\nOn the other hand, attraction is subjective. People can have preferences based on appearance, and that's part of human nature. The author isn't opposing trans rights or being hostile, just stating her preferences. But the term \"TERF\" is charged, and being called that might be a reaction to the idea that her preferences could be exclusionary.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? If the wrong is being transphobic, she might not be, as she's not denying trans women's identities. But if the wrong is contributing to transphobia by making attraction contingent on appearance, which can marginalize trans women, then she might be in the wrong. However, the line is blurry here. It's possible that she's not in the wrong because personal attraction is valid, but others might see her stance as problematic. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the community standards consider this exclusionary. If the community believes that being a lesbian includes being attracted to all women regardless of appearance, then the author might be seen as wrong. If the community allows for personal preferences, then she's not. But given the context of her being called a TERF and excluded, the community likely sees her as wrong. However, from a personal freedom angle, she's not wrong for having her preferences. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) or A (in the wrong) depending on perspective. But the user's own thought is A, but they're unsure. I need to decide based on the broader social context.\n"
