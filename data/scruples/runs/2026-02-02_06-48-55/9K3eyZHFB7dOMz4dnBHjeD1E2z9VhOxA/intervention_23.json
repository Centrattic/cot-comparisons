I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a self-identified lesbian who isn't attracted to transgender women who still look masculine, and she's facing backlash for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't transphobic but is not attracted to people who look like men, including MTFs (male-to-female trans women) who haven't fully transitioned in her eyes. Her friends and online communities are labeling her as a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and transphobic, even though she says she's not opposed to trans women if they present as feminine and don't have a penis. \n\nThe question is whether her stance makes her the asshole. The debate here seems to hinge on the distinction between attraction based on physical presentation versus gender identity. Some people argue that gender identity is what matters, so if someone identifies as a woman, they should be considered a woman regardless of their physical appearance. Others believe that attraction is based on how someone presents, and that's a valid personal preference.\n\nThe author claims she's not transphobic, just not attracted to men or masculine-presenting individuals. The friends and community, however, see her as excluding trans women, hence the TERF label. The key issue is whether personal attraction based on presentation is acceptable or if it's inherently discriminatory.\n\nI need to consider the definitions. TERFs often oppose certain aspects of trans rights, but the author isn't opposing trans women's rights per se; she's stating her own lack of attraction. However, the line between personal preference and transphobia can be blurry. If she's excluding trans women based on their gender identity (because they're trans) rather than their presentation, that could be seen as transphobic. But if she's just not attracted to certain physical traits, it's more about personal taste.\n\nThe situation also mentions that she isn't opposed to trans women who fully pass as women and those who have undergone surgery. This suggests that her issue is with the physical presentation, not the gender identity itself. However, some might argue that the expectation for trans women to \"pass\" as cis women is a form of transphobia because it devalues their identity based on appearance.\n\nThe author is facing social backlash for her views. The question is whether her views are wrong. In terms of moral right or wrong, it's a complex issue. Personal attraction is subjective, but when it comes to trans individuals, the debate is about whether excluding them based on appearance is equivalent to discrimination. If she's not denying trans women's identity or rights, just stating her own preferences, some might say she's not in the wrong. Others might argue that such preferences contribute to marginalization.\n\nIn legal and ethical terms, it's different from institutional discrimination. The author isn't being asked to deny trans women's rights but is being criticized for her personal preferences. The line between personal preference and prejudice is thin here. The friends' reaction might stem from the belief that all women, including trans women, deserve equal consideration in dating contexts, regardless of appearance.\n\nI need to remember that the author isn't acting out of malice but is expressing a personal preference. However, the impact of her statement on trans women's inclusion and how it's perceived by the community matters. If her stance leads to exclusion or contributes to a hostile environment, some might see it as problematic. But if it's just her own preferences without harming others, others might argue it's not her fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether one views attraction based on appearance as acceptable or as a form of prejudice. Since the author isn't denying trans women's identity or rights, but rather her own attraction based on presentation, it's a matter of personal choice. However, the community's reaction is influenced by the broader context of trans rights and inclusion. So, the author might not be in the wrong from a personal autonomy perspective, but her views could be seen as contributing to a culture that marginalizes trans women who don't present in a certain way.\n"
