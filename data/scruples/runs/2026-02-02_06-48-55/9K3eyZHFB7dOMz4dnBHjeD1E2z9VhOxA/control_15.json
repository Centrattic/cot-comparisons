I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about attraction preferences and the reactions from others calling her a TERF and transphobic.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as a lesbian and is not attracted to trans women who still look like men. She's not being mean or actively discriminatory; she's just stating her personal attraction. The issue arises because others are labeling her as transphobic or a TERF. TERF is a term used for those who oppose trans rights, but in this case, the author isn't opposing trans women's rights; she's just not attracted to them when they don't present femininely. \n\nShe clarifies that she isn't attracted to men or people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. The problem comes from the fact that trans women, even if they are transitioning or have a male appearance, are women in the eyes of the trans community and many allies. By excluding them based on appearance, she's causing conflict. \n\nHowever, attraction is a personal matter. People can have preferences, and it doesn't necessarily make them bigoted. The author isn't advocating for discrimination against trans women but is expressing her own limits. The tension here is between personal preference and societal expectations around acceptance. \n\nThe friends and community members are upset because they believe respecting someone's identity is more important than how they look. The author's refusal to engage with trans women who present masculinely is seen as invalidating their identity, even if it's not intentional. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, it's about intent. If she's not denying trans women rights or using derogatory language, her personal preferences might not make her wrong. But in terms of social context, her preferences can cause harm by contributing to exclusion. \n\nSo, balancing personal autonomy with social responsibility is tricky. The answer hinges on whether being in the wrong is about her actions causing harm versus having personal preferences. Since she's not acting with malice but is causing discomfort, it's a complex situation. The author might be wrong in the eyes of the community but not inherently wrong in the sense of being malicious.\n"
