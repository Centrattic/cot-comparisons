I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a self-identified lesbian, not being attracted to trans women who still present as men, and facing backlash for expressing that preference.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't attracted to MTF trans people who look like men, which leads to conflict. They were called a TERF and transphobic. The main issue here is about attraction based on appearance versus gender identity.\n\nI should consider the definitions. TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which typically refers to those who exclude trans women from being recognized as women. However, the author isn't necessarily making a political statement but rather expressing personal attraction preferences. The key is whether personal attraction preferences can be considered transphobic.\n\nTrans women are women, so if someone is a lesbian, does their attraction to trans women depend on presentation? The author's stance is that they're only attracted to people who look like women, which might exclude some trans women who haven't fully transitioned in appearance. But is that exclusion transphobic, or is it just about personal preference?\n\nThe friends and the community are reacting negatively, calling the author transphobic. Is their reaction valid? It's possible that the author isn't transphobic but just has specific attraction criteria. However, the line between personal preference and prejudice can be blurry here. The author isn't denying trans people's identity, just stating they aren't attracted to those who look like men.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend called them a TERF, which might be an overreaction. The author isn't advocating against trans rights but is expressing their own sexual orientation. TERFs usually have a political agenda, whereas the author is discussing personal preferences.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't date butch girls unless they look feminine. This seems like a personal preference about presentation, not necessarily gender identity. So, the author's issue is with presentation (beard, short hair, etc.) rather than gender identity itself.\n\nHowever, trans women are women, so if the author is not attracted to trans women who haven't passed as female in appearance, does that make their preference transphobic? Or is it just about aesthetic preferences? The problem arises when someone's preference isn't just about attraction but leads to exclusion or discrimination.\n\nBut in this case, the author is talking about personal choices in dating, not advocating for policies or public discrimination. The issue is whether personal attraction preferences can be considered harmful. Some argue that if a person's attraction is based on someone's presentation, which can be a part of their identity, it's not inherently wrong. Others might say that by not being attracted to trans women who don't pass, it contributes to stigma.\n\nThe author is not denying trans women's existence or rights; they're stating they aren't sexually attracted to them if they look like men. This is similar to someone saying they're not attracted to butch lesbians or cross-dressers. However, trans women are different in that their gender identity is female. So, if someone is only attracted to people who present femininely, they might naturally be attracted to trans women who do the same, but not those who haven't. \n\nIn terms of being a \"real lesbian,\" some argue that lesbianism is about attraction to women regardless of their physical characteristics, including trans women. Others view it as attraction to women in all their forms, including trans women. However, the author's stance is based on presentation, not identity. If the author is attracted to women who present as women, then trans women who present as women should be included. However, if they aren't attracted to trans women who still present as men, that's a presentation-based preference.\n\nThe question is whether this preference is acceptable. The author isn't being transphobic by denying trans women's identity, but by not being attracted to them based on appearance. Since attraction is subjective, it's not necessarily in the author's wrong to have such preferences. However, the backlash comes from the community's expectation that attraction should be based on gender identity rather than presentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being transphobic but is expressing personal preferences. The conflict arises from differing views on what constitutes being a lesbian. If the author isn't excluding trans women from being women but just isn't attracted to those who meet certain appearance criteria, they aren't in the wrong. However, if they are using their preference to deny trans women's womanhood, then they would be. In this case, the author isn't doing that, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
