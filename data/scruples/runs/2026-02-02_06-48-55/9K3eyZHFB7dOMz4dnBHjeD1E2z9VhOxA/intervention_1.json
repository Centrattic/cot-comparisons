I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look masculine, and she's facing backlash for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as a lesbian and isn't attracted to people who look like men, including trans women who haven't fully passed as women. Her friends and others online are calling her a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and transphobic, even though she claims not to be. The central issue is whether her lack of attraction is a personal preference or discrimination.\n\nI recall that TERFs often hold views that exclude trans women from being considered women, sometimes based on biological essentialism. The author isn't denying that trans women are women but is stating her personal attraction preferences. However, the term \"TERF\" can be applied broadly, even if someone isn't a feminist, just because they exclude trans women. The author is being accused of that.\n\nThe question is whether her preference makes her wrong. On one hand, people have the right to their sexual preferences. No one is required to be attracted to a certain gender presentation. On the other hand, the backlash might stem from a societal push to recognize gender identity over presentation. If she's not being hostile but is just stating her attraction, is that transphobia?\n\nTransphobia involves prejudice or discrimination against trans people. If she's not engaging in hate speech or actively excluding them from social situations, just not being attracted, it's a personal choice. However, the line can be blurry. The friends might see her stance as contributing to marginalization, especially if she's not open to relationships with trans women. They might argue that by not accepting trans women as valid partners, she's reinforcing stereotypes or harmful attitudes.\n\nBut the author isn't denying the existence or validity of trans women. She's just not attracted to those who haven't transitioned to a feminine appearance. That seems more like a preference than active discrimination. Yet, in some communities, there's an expectation to be inclusive regardless of personal preferences, which can lead to conflict.\n\nI need to consider the definitions. TERFs are typically more about exclusion based on trans women's status as women, but if the author isn't challenging that but rather focusing on presentation, it's different. However, the term might still be used here to label her as exclusionary, regardless of her intent.\n\nThe key here is whether her personal preferences are being conflated with systemic discrimination. She's not advocating for policies or actions that harm trans women; she's just expressing her own attractions. However, the social context is that supporting trans rights includes respecting their identities, which might include dating trans women. If she's not willing, some may see that as not respecting their gender identity, especially if they pass as women.\n\nBut I also think that attraction is subjective. People can have specific preferences without being bigoted. The problem arises when those preferences lead to exclusion or prejudice beyond personal choices. Since she's not denying trans women's identities but is just not attracted to those who look masculine, it's a personal preference, not a systemic issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's friends see her stance as exclusionary, her personal preferences don't necessarily make her wrong. It's a matter of personal choice versus community expectations. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because she's expressing her own attraction, which is a personal matter, and not engaging in active discrimination.\n"
