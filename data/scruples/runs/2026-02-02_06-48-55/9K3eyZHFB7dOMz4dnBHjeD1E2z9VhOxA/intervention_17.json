I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men and is getting called a \"terf\" and other names for it. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a lesbian, so she's interested in women. The issue is that some trans women on dating apps might still present as they did before transitioning, like having a masculine appearance. The author isn't attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. She's been told that this makes her transphobic or a \"terf,\" which stands for \"trans-exclusionary radical feminist,\" a term often used negatively for those who exclude trans women from being considered women. \n\nNow, the key here is the difference between attraction based on presentation versus identity. The author isn't rejecting trans women because they are trans, but because they don't meet her aesthetic criteria. She states she's not attracted to butch girls unless they have some femininity. So it's about physical presentation, not identity. However, some people might argue that by excluding trans women who haven't fully transitioned, she's contributing to discrimination against them.\n\nThe question is whether her preference is wrong. Legally and ethically, discrimination based on attraction isn't the same as discrimination based on identity. But in the context of the LGBTQ+ community, there's a strong emphasis on respecting gender identity over presentation. So if a trans woman identifies as a woman, some might argue that the author's exclusion is transphobic, even if it's not intentional. \n\nOn the other hand, attraction is subjective. People have preferences about what they find attractive, and that's generally considered okay unless it's tied to prejudice. The author isn't opposing the existence of trans women or denying their identity; she's just not attracted to certain presentations. The problem arises when her preference is framed as a rejection of trans women themselves rather than their presentation.\n\nHowever, the term \"terf\" is usually applied to those who deny the validity of trans women's identities. The author says she's not transphobic, just not attracted to men or those who look like men. But in the eyes of her friends, her stance might be seen as exclusionary because it's based on appearance rather than identity. There's a conflict between personal attraction and the community's values here.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If someone is not attracted to trans women who have a masculine appearance, is that their choice, or is it prejudice against trans women? If she's not denying their identity but just their presentation, it's a personal preference. But if the community perceives it as exclusion based on identity, then perhaps she's seen as the problem. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. She's not in the wrong for having personal preferences about attraction, but her phrasing or the way others interpret her stance might contribute to marginalizing trans women. The line between personal preference and prejudice can be blurry here. However, the author isn't making a political statement; she's just being honest about her attractions. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but others are projecting their expectations onto her.\n"
