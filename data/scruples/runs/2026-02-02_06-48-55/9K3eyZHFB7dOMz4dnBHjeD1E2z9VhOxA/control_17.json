I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a lesbian who's using Bumble and finds that sometimes male profiles (with beards, short hair, etc.) are shown as women. She's not attracted to people who look like men and expressed that to her friend, who then confronted her about it. The friend is bisexual, and when they came across a trans woman profile that looked very masculine, the author admitted she's not attracted to people who look like men. The friend called her a TERF and left. The author is now confused and seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't transphobic but has a preference in attraction based on appearance. She's being labeled a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist), which usually refers to people who exclude trans women from being considered women. However, the author says she's not transphobic. The main issue is her attraction being tied to presentation rather than gender identity.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Personal Attraction vs. Transphobia**: It's one thing to have personal preferences in attraction and another to hold prejudiced views against trans individuals. The author states she's just not attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. If she's not denying their identity but simply stating her own attraction, is that wrong?\n\n2. **TERF Labeling**: Being called a TERF might be an overreaction if she's not denying trans women's identities. However, if her stance could contribute to marginalizing trans women, maybe others see it as exclusionary. But the author is clear she's not transphobic, just has a preference.\n\n3. **Impact on Trans Women**: The author's friend and others argue that by not being open to trans women who may not pass as female, it contributes to violence or stigma. But the author isn't discriminating against trans people in general; she's only speaking to her own attraction. \n\n4. **Community Reactions**: The author was kicked out of a Facebook group. That's a community decision, but does that mean she was in the wrong? It's possible the community has a strict stance on inclusion, but personal attraction preferences aren't necessarily wrong.\n\n5. **Consent and Right to Choose**: The author has the right to choose her own partners based on her preferences, as long as it's not harmful. If she's not making a political statement or excluding trans women from society, just from her own dating pool, is that her right?\n\nNow, considering the context. The author isn't denying trans women's womanhood; she's just not attracted to people who look like men. Her friend is making a value judgment that \"a real lesbian\" should be attracted to trans women regardless of presentation. The author's stance is about personal preference, not transphobia. \n\nHowever, the line can be blurry. If the author's preference is based on the person's assigned sex (i.e., male-presenting individuals, regardless of gender identity), that could be seen as trans-exclusionary. But if she's open to trans women who don't look masculine, then it's more about presentation. \n\nIn the scenario, the author is clear she would date trans women who pass as female and either don't mind her not engaging in penis-related sex or have had surgery. So her criteria is about appearance and specific medical transitions, not outright exclusion based on trans status. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. On one hand, she's not transphobic; she's being honest about her attraction. On the other, her preference might overlap with trans-exclusionary views if the underlying reason is about the person's assigned sex. But the author herself doesn't hold that view. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's expressing her own attraction preferences without denying trans women's identities or advocating against their rights. The issue is more about personal preference in dating, which is subjective and not inherently wrong.\n"
