I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men. She got into a conflict where her friends called her a TERF and she was kicked out of a group. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a lesbian and states she's not attracted to people who look like men, regardless of their gender identity. She's clear that she's not transphobic but just not interested in people with male-presenting features. The issue arises when she's criticized for this stance, labeled a TERF, and excluded from communities.\n\nTERFs are typically defined as people who oppose the inclusion of trans women in feminist movements, often based on the idea that trans women aren't women. The author isn't making a political statement but is speaking about her personal attraction. She's not denying the identity of trans women but is honest about her own preferences.\n\nNow, the main question is whether her preferences make her wrong. Personal attraction is subjective. People have different criteria for what they find attractive. For example, some people might be into certain body types, styles, or other characteristics. The author isn't saying trans women aren't women; she's saying she's not attracted to those who don't meet her criteria of feminine appearance, regardless of their gender identity.\n\nThe conflict comes from societal expectations versus personal choice. Some argue that as a lesbian, one should be attracted to women regardless of their appearance, including trans women. However, others might say that attraction is about gender identity, not physical presentation. But the author is clear that her attraction is based on how someone presents (passing as a girl) rather than their gender identity. \n\nIt's important to distinguish between attraction to gender identity versus physical presentation. Some people experience attraction based on gender identity (gender identity attraction), while others are more focused on physical traits (gender expression). The author's case seems to be the latter. \n\nThe friends and community's reaction might stem from the belief that being a lesbian should mean attraction to all women, including trans women. However, personal attraction isn't always that straightforward. The author isn't transphobic but is being honest about her preferences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether her stance is a valid personal choice or if it's discriminatory. Since she's not denying the existence or validity of trans women's identities but is making a personal choice about her own attraction, it's more about personal preference. Being called a TERF might be a misapplication of the term, as she's not opposing trans women's inclusion but stating her own limits.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having personal attraction preferences. She's not harming anyone by being honest about what she's attracted to. It's a matter of personal choice, not transphobia. The real issue might be the community's tolerance for differing opinions on attraction criteria.\n"
