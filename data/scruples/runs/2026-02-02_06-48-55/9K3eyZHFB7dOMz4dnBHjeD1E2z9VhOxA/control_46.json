I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men and is facing backlash for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't transphobic but has specific attraction criteria. They're not attracted to people who present as men, even if they're trans women. Their friends and online communities are calling them a TERF and being hostile.\n\nWhat's a TERF? It's a term used for people who exclude trans women from being part of the female community, often with transphobic views. But the author isn't saying trans women aren't women; they just aren't personally attracted to those who look masculine. So maybe the term is being misapplied here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about personal attraction and presentation. They don't date butch women unless they have some femininity. This seems like a personal preference, not a political stance. The issue arises when others conflate personal preferences with transphobia or exclusionary behavior.\n\nHowever, the author's friend and others argue that gender identity is what matters, not presentation. There's a debate here about whether personal attraction based on appearance is acceptable or if it's discriminatory. The author isn't saying trans women are less valid, just that their own attractions are specific.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If being a TERF requires intentional exclusion or harm towards trans women, then maybe not. The author isn't advocating against trans women's rights; they're just stating their personal preferences. However, in some communities, even personal preferences about attraction can be seen as problematic if they contribute to marginalization.\n\nBut the key here is that the author isn't refusing to accept trans women as women or their identities. They're just not attracted to those who look masculine. Personal attraction can be based on various factors, including appearance. Unless their stance is causing harm beyond their personal choices (like spreading transphobia), it's a matter of individual preference.\n\nThe friends' reaction might be overzealous, conflating personal preferences with harmful ideologies. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own standards of attraction. They are, however, in a position where their preferences clash with community values, but that doesn't necessarily make them an asshole.\n"
