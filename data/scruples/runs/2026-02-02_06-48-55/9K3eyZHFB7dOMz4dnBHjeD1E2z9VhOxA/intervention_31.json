I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look like men, and she's facing backlash for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't being transphobic, just not sexually attracted to people who have a male presentation, even if they're trans. She's being called a TERF for it. TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which is a term often used for those who exclude trans women from the female community. But the author is a lesbian, not necessarily a feminist, so maybe that term is being misapplied here.\n\nThe question is about attraction. The author isn't rejecting trans women because of their identity but because of their presentation. She's clear that if they pass as women, she's okay. So it's about physical appearance, not gender identity. But the friends are upset because they believe she should focus on gender identity rather than presentation.\n\nIs it wrong to have personal preferences in attraction? People have different attractions, and it's generally accepted that attraction can be based on various factors. However, the issue arises when those preferences lead to transphobia. The author isn't denying trans women's identity; she's stating her own limits in attraction. \n\nBut when she was corrected by her friend, she was defensive. The friend called her a TERF, which might be an overreaction. The author isn't against trans rights; she just has a personal preference. However, by being vocal about it, she might contribute to a hostile environment for trans women. \n\nThe friends kicked her out of the group, which is aggressive. But the author is confused because she doesn't see her stance as wrong. The core issue is whether personal attraction preferences are acceptable or if they cross into transphobia. \n\nIn many discussions, the emphasis is on respecting gender identity while acknowledging that attraction can vary. The author isn't denying trans women's identity but is focusing on presentation. If she's not attacking their identity, just stating her own limits, is that wrong? \n\nBut some might argue that by prioritizing presentation, even if it's about passing as female, it can perpetuate stereotypes that trans women are not \"real\" women unless they look a certain way. However, the author is clear that she accepts trans women who pass, so maybe it's more about physical traits rather than identity. \n\nIn summary, the author's stance might not be transphobic, but her vocal defense and the reactions she's gotten complicate things. The question is whether having certain attraction criteria makes her an asshole. Since the author isn't spreading hate but has personal preferences, she might not be in the wrong. However, the way she's handling it could be problematic if it's dismissive of trans women's experiences. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether personal attraction preferences are considered acceptable. If the author isn't harming trans women directly and is honest about her preferences, she might not be in the wrong. But if her views contribute to a culture that marginalizes trans women, she could be seen as an asshole. The line is thin here. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
