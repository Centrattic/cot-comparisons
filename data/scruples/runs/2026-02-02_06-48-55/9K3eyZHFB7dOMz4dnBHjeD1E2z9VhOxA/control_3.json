I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a self-identified lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who present as men (like the example with Jacob who has a beard and short hair). She uses Bumble and is frustrated when male-presenting trans women show up on her app. Her friend and some of her LGBT friends are calling her a TERF and transphobic, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which typically refers to feminists who oppose transgender women's inclusion in women-only spaces and deny the validity of trans women as women. The author isn't opposing trans women's rights in that context; she's just stating her personal attraction preferences. But the term is being hurled at her, which might be an oversimplification or misapplication.\n\nThe key point here is that the author isn't denying trans women's identity or gender. She's not advocating for their exclusion from the community or treating them with hate. She's being honest about her personal preferences. The question is whether being honest about one's attraction criteria is being in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people have preferences in who they're attracted to, regardless of gender identity. For example, someone might prefer a certain body type, style, or other physical traits. The author is saying she's not attracted to people who present as men, even if they are trans women. The issue arises when such preferences are seen as harmful or bigoted. However, attraction is subjective and personal. \n\nBut the problem may be the context in which this is discussed. The author's friends and community see her criteria as transphobic because they believe that valid attraction should be based on gender identity, not presentation. The author is not transphobic; she's just not attracted to certain presentations. The challenge here is balancing individual preferences with the community's values of inclusivity and acceptance.\n\nTERF accusations often come from a place of defending trans women's rights and validity. However, if the author isn't denying trans women's identity, merely stating her own attraction preferences, then being called a TERF might be a stretch. It's possible that the community is conflating personal preference with transphobia, which could be an unfair reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's criteria could lead to harm or exclusion, that's different. But in this case, she's not excluding trans women from spaces or rights; she's just not personally attracted to them if they present as men. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this preference, which is subjective. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, the LGBT community generally emphasizes acceptance and inclusion. If the author's preferences could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for trans women, that's a problem. However, if she's simply stating her own attraction without derogatory language or actions, it's more a matter of personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal attraction preferences can be considered wrong, especially when not based on hatred or denial of identity. The author isn't transphobic but has a specific attraction standard. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), as she's not violating any rights or causing direct harm through her preferences, even if others find her criteria problematic.\n"
