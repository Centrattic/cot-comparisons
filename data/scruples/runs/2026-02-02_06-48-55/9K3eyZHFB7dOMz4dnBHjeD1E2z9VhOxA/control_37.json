I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a self-identified lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look masculine, and is facing backlash from friends and online communities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. A TERF is someone who opposes transgender women's inclusion in women's spaces. The author is not against trans women's identities but is stating her personal attraction preferences. She's not denying their womanhood, just her attraction.\n\nThe key points are about attraction and personal preference. Sexual orientation is about who someone is attracted to. If she's not attracted to people who appear masculine, regardless of gender identity, that's her right. However, the backlash comes from friends and groups accusing her of being transphobic or a TERF.\n\nBut the author isn't making a political stance; she's expressing her personal attraction. It's important to differentiate between personal preferences and prejudice. Just because someone isn't attracted to a group doesn't make them bigoted. However, the term \"TERF\" is often used pejoratively, so being called that might indicate others see her stance as harmful, even if she doesn't intend it.\n\nThe ethical aspect here is whether her preference is valid. She's not harming anyone by not being attracted, but the way she's expressing her views might be causing harm by perpetuating stereotypes or contributing to exclusion. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If she's not transphobic, just not interested, then she's not wrong for having those preferences. The conflict arises from differing views on identity vs. presentation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong), because attraction is personal, and she's not denying others' identities. The issue is more about societal inclusion and how her preferences are perceived, but not necessarily her being wrong.\n"
