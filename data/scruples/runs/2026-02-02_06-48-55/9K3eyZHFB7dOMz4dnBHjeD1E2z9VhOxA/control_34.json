I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who identifies as a lesbian, not being attracted to trans women who look like men. People around her are calling her a TERF and transphobic, but she argues she's not transphobic, just not attracted to men or people who look like men.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what TERF means. TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which is a term often used for feminists who exclude or oppose trans women in the feminist movement. The author isn't a feminist in this context, but the label is being used here. The key issue here is whether her preference for partners who look feminine is transphobic or not.\n\nThe author states she's not attracted to people who look like men, including trans women who haven't fully transitioned or passed as women. She's clear that she only wants partners who present as feminine and who she's not attracted to because of their appearance. She's not rejecting trans women per se but is specifically not into those who have a masculine presentation.\n\nNow, the question is whether this preference makes her wrong. On one hand, transphobia would involve discrimination based on gender identity, not just presentation. However, if someone's attraction is based on physical presentation and they only exclude people because they look like men (regardless of their gender identity), it could be seen as transphobic if it's excluding trans women who are transitioning or haven't fully passed. But if the author is open to trans women who pass as women, maybe it's more about presentation than identity. \n\nHowever, the term \"TERF\" is usually applied to those who deny the validity of trans women's identity, not just their appearance. The author here isn't denying their identity but their attraction is based on presentation. Still, there's a line between personal attraction and prejudice. The author is being called out for being transphobic, but she's arguing it's about her sexuality. \n\nIn terms of the community's perspective, being transphobic isn't just about hating trans people but also about discriminatory attitudes. If someone's sexual orientation is such that they can't be attracted to trans women unless they look feminine, it's a matter of personal preference, but if that leads to exclusion or harmful attitudes, it can be problematic. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is considered transphobic. Since she's not rejecting trans women who pass as women, maybe it's not transphobia. But by making a distinction based on appearance, it could be seen as contributing to the idea that trans women are only acceptable if they conform to certain feminine standards, which can be exclusionary.\n\nOn the other hand, attraction is subjective, and people have different preferences. However, in the context of the LGBTQ+ community, there's a push for inclusivity and acceptance of all trans individuals regardless of their appearance. The author's stance might be seen as conflicting with that, hence the backlash.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's preference might not be transphobic in intent, but the effect could be exclusionary. The community might still see this as a problem, leading to her being labeled a TERF even if she's not. The answer hinges on whether personal attraction preferences are acceptable or if they cross into transphobic behavior.\n"
