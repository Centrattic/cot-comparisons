I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a lesbian who isn't attracted to trans women who still look masculine, like the example of Jacob. Her friends and some community members are calling her a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and have even kicked her out of a Facebook group.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't being transphobic, she says. She's just not attracted to people who present as men, whether they're cis or trans. She's being honest about her preferences, but people are reacting negatively. The question is whether she's in the wrong for holding these preferences.\n\nTERFs are typically associated with excluding trans women from being women, which is a more extreme stance. The author here is excluding people based on appearance, not gender identity. She's not denying trans women's identities, but she only wants to date trans women who look feminine and don't have a penis. So, maybe she's not a TERF, but she's being criticized as one.\n\nNow, is it wrong to have such preferences? It's a bit of a gray area. Attraction is personal, and people have different criteria. But when these preferences lead to excluding certain groups, even if unintentionally, it can cause harm. The author's friends argue that a \"real lesbian\" wouldn't care about presentation, emphasizing gender identity over appearance. However, some might say that attraction based on appearance is valid because people are naturally attracted to certain looks.\n\nBut the conflict here arises because her stance is seen as transphobic. Even if she's not directly targeting trans women, her exclusion based on presentation can contribute to a negative environment. The term TERF is thrown around, which is a serious accusation. However, the author isn't denying trans women's existence; she's just not attracted to those who don't pass as feminine. This is different from exclusion based on identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being called a TERF because her preferences exclude trans women who are still transitioning or don't pass as feminine. This could inadvertently contribute to marginalizing trans women who aren't yet presenting as their gender. But is that her fault? She's not transphobic; she's just being honest about her attraction.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy in relationships. If she's not attracted to someone, she has the right to not pursue a relationship. However, the way she's communicating this might come off as dismissive or harmful to trans women. The key is whether her preferences are based on the trans identity or the presentation. Since she's focusing on how they look, it's more about presentation, but it still affects trans women who don't fit that mold.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's complicated. She's not being transphobic by denying their identity, but her preferences could be seen as excluding trans women who don't meet her aesthetic standards. The community is reacting strongly because their focus is on gender identity, not physical appearance. Therefore, even if her intentions are good, her stance can be hurtful. However, her own right to attraction is a personal matter. The answer might depend on whether preferences based on appearance are considered acceptable in the broader community context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for her personal preferences, the way those preferences are expressed and the impact on trans women might make her stance problematic in the eyes of the community. But since attraction is subjective, she's not entirely wrong either. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, but there's a gray area here.\n"
