I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to MTF individuals who still look like men. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as a lesbian and explains that they're not attracted to people who look like men, including trans women who haven't fully transitioned or \"passed\" as female. They got into an argument with a friend who accused them of being a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and transphobic. The friend left the conversation, and the author is now confused about whether they're the asshole here.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author is clear that their lack of attraction is based on appearance and not on transphobia. They mention that they don't date butch girls unless they have some femininity, so their criteria are about presentation. But the issue is whether this is acceptable or if it's exclusionary.\n\nTERFs are typically associated with transphobic views, but the author isn't saying trans women aren't women. They're just not attracted to those who look like men. So maybe the accusation of being a TERF is a misunderstanding. However, some people might see this as discriminatory because it's excluding trans women based on their appearance, which can be a valid concern for the trans community.\n\nOn the other hand, attraction is subjective. People have different preferences, and being a lesbian doesn't necessarily mean being attracted to all women, including trans women. The author isn't denying the identity of trans women but is stating their personal attraction is based on presentation. However, the line between personal preference and transphobia can be blurry here. \n\nLegally and socially, it's not wrong to have personal preferences in attraction. But in terms of community standards within LGBTQ+ spaces, there's a push for inclusivity, so some might view the author's stance as exclusionary. The author's friends might feel that by not being open to trans women who don't look feminine, they're contributing to marginalization. \n\nThe author isn't rejecting trans women's identities but their own attraction based on presentation. That's a personal choice. However, if this leads to spreading harmful stereotypes or contributing to transphobia, it could be problematic. The author's friends might see it that way, hence the backlash.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally and in terms of personal autonomy, no. Attraction varies, and people can have preferences. But socially, within the LGBTQ+ community, there's an emphasis on supporting all members, including trans women. The author's stance might be seen as conflicting with that, leading others to label them as a TERF. However, the author isn't denying the womanhood of trans women, just their own attraction based on appearance.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on the perspective. From a personal freedom angle, the author isn't wrong. From a community inclusivity angle, there's a valid concern. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't being transphobic but rather stating their attraction preferences, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
