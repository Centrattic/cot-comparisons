I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a self-identified lesbian who's not attracted to trans women who look masculine and is facing backlash for that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't transphobic but is clear about her attraction to people who look like women. She faces criticism for not wanting to date trans women who haven't fully transitioned in terms of appearance or surgery. \n\nThe term \"TERF\" is thrown, which usually refers to trans-exclusionary radical feminists. The author isn't excluding trans people from social spaces but is talking about her personal preferences. \n\nThe main issue is attraction based on presentation. The author isn't denying the validity of trans women's identities but is stating her personal preferences. There's a difference between personal attraction and transphobia. \n\nBut some might argue that by not being attracted to trans women based on their appearance, she's contributing to exclusion. However, sexual attraction is subjective. The author isn't saying trans women aren't women; she's just not attracted to those who look more masculine. \n\nThe friends are upset, calling her a TERF, but the author's stance is about personal preference, not transphobia. The fact that she's not even open to engaging with a trans woman who has a penis suggests a focus on physical appearance rather than gender identity. \n\nThe key here is that the author is expressing her own preferences, which are valid unless they're harmful. Since she's not denying the existence or validity of trans women as women, just stating her attraction criteria, it's more about personal choice. \n\nHowever, the term \"TERF\" is a strong accusation, and the author might be unaware of how her stance is perceived. The friends might be conflating personal attraction with transphobia, especially if the author isn't open to any form of transitioned trans women. \n\nBut the author isn't advocating against trans rights or exclusion from society; she's talking about her own dating preferences. So, is she wrong? It depends on whether personal attraction can be separated from societal acceptance. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for her personal preferences, but she might need to understand why others see it as problematic. Her stance isn't transphobic, but the way it's framed might come across as exclusionary, especially if she's not open to any trans women unless they meet certain criteria. However, the core issue is attraction, which is personal. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
