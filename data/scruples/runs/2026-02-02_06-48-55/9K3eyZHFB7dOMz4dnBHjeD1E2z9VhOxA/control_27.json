I\u2019ve already gotten called a \u201ccocksucker\u201d (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I\u2019m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I\u2019ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there\u2019s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person\u2019s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t attracted to them, and why I wasn\u2019t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I\u2019m close minded and that a \u201creal lesbian\u201d wouldn\u2019t care about things like that and wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like \u201cJacob\u201d because it\u2019s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn\u2019t do anything wrong?? I\u2019m not transphobic, I\u2019m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don\u2019t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I\u2019ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don\u2019t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it\u2019s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn\u2019t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there\u2019s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to MTFs who look like men. The situation is presented through a Reddit-style post where the author is facing backlash for their preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author identifies as a lesbian and is not attracted to individuals who present as men, even if they are trans women. They faced criticism for this stance, being labeled a \"TERF\" and kicked out of an LGBT group. The key issue here is the intersection of personal attraction and societal expectations regarding gender identity and presentation.\n\nTERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, which typically refers to someone who excludes trans women from being women. The author clarifies they aren't transphobic but are stating their attraction is based on presentation. However, the backlash suggests that some people view this as exclusionary.\n\nThe author argues that their preference isn't about gender identity but about physical presentation. They mention they don't date butch girls unless they have some femininity, which complicates things because butch lesbian identities are part of the lesbian community. This inconsistency might be a point of contention. The author's friend called them a TERF, implying exclusion based on gender identity, but the author insists it's about appearance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, it's about personal sexual orientation. The author has the right to their preferences, as attraction is subjective. However, some in the community may argue that valid identities are being dismissed. The author isn't denying trans status, just their own attraction, which isn't about transphobia but personal preference.\n\nBut the term \"TERF\" is used pejoratively, and being labeled as such can indicate exclusionary views, even if unintended. The author is being criticized for not engaging with trans women who present as men, which some see as essentialist (focusing on appearance over identity). The key is that the author isn't harming anyone; they're expressing their preferences. However, the community might expect acceptance of all gender identities regardless of presentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is a matter of personal preference, but the conflict arises from differing views on the importance of gender identity versus presentation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their preferences, but the way their preferences are interacting with community expectations might lead to conflict. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're not denying trans identities or spreading hate, their right to their preferences should be respected. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
