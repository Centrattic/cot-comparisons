I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for shouting at a woman who takes a week off every month. The situation involves a male-dominated sales group where a new female member joins. She takes a week off for period pains and stress, which causes the team to work extra hours. The author questions her absence, asks for a medical certificate, and ends up shouting at her.\n\nFirst, from a legal and ethical standpoint, in many places, employees are entitled to take time off for health reasons without needing to provide proof unless specified by company policy. The author's demand for a medical certificate might not be justified unless the company's policy requires it. The boss seems to have supported her taking time off, which suggests that there's some flexibility, but the author's approach was confrontational.\n\nThen there's the issue of gender sensitivity. The author's comment about \"how unprofessional\" she was being and the lack of understanding regarding women's health issues could be seen as dismissive. The fact that the boss reprimanded him for not respecting women's pain indicates that his reaction was inappropriate. Shouting in a professional setting is generally unprofessional, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that she was making up excuses without evidence is problematic. It's important to trust colleagues' reasons for taking time off unless there's a pattern of abuse. The author didn't have proof but chose to question her based on assumptions, which can foster a hostile work environment, especially for a female employee in a male-dominated field.\n\nThe team's reaction, telling the author to let it go, and the woman's Instagram post about men not understanding women's issues add context to the sensitivity of the situation. The author's approach not only affected the team dynamics but also showed a lack of empathy and understanding towards a colleague's personal health issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted unprofessionally by shouting and questioning her credibility without evidence. The boss was right to reprimand him for not respecting women's health issues. The correct answer would be A, as the author is in the wrong.\n"
