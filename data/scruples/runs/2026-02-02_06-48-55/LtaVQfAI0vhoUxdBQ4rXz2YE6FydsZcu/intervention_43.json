I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for shouting at a female coworker for taking a week off every month. The situation involves workplace dynamics, gender sensitivity, and professional conduct.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He questioned her about needing a medical certificate for her period-related absence. Then he shouted at her, implying she was excusing herself and making the others work extra. The key points here are the justification for her absence, the method of addressing it (publicly shouting), and the gender aspect.\n\nLegally, in many countries, taking time off for medical reasons, including menstrual issues, is protected. Employers might require medical certification, but the employee isn't obligated to share personal health details publicly. The author's demand for a certificate in a public lunch setting was inappropriate. Also, shouting in a group setting would be unprofessional and possibly hostile.\n\nFrom a gender sensitivity perspective, questioning a woman's health issues in a judgmental manner is problematic. It reinforces stereotypes that women's health issues are not valid or that they use them as excuses. The boss's response to \"respect a woman's pain\" aligns with the idea that such health issues are legitimate and should be handled with sensitivity.\n\nThe author's justification that the boss didn't require proof either is weak. The boss might have handled it privately, but the author's public confrontation and yelling were unprofessional regardless. The fact that the coworkers told him to let it go suggests that his approach was not only wrong in the boss's eyes but also among peers.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's public shouting and accusatory behavior were unprofessional and disrespectful. He should have addressed any concerns through appropriate channels and with sensitivity, not by publicly shaming a colleague. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
