I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a male colleague who shouted at a female coworker for taking a week off due to period-related issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman joined a male-dominated sales team and took a week off for health reasons. The author questioned her about needing a medical certificate, thinking it was an excuse. He then shouted at her, leading to a reprimand from their boss.\n\nLegally, in many places, taking time off for menstrual issues can be protected under health leave, especially if it's part of a recognized condition like endometriosis or severe PMS. The boss's response suggests that the company values respecting women's health issues, which aligns with broader policies promoting gender equality in the workplace.\n\nFrom a workplace etiquette standpoint, the author's approach was inappropriate. Questioning a colleague's medical leave without evidence and shouting in the workplace is unprofessional. It's important to trust colleagues' reasons for taking leave unless there's a clear policy requiring documentation. The fact that the boss told the author to \"respect a woman's pain\" indicates that the company values empathy and understanding.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial assumption that the woman was lying could be seen as sexist. Assuming that someone, especially a woman, is using a health issue as an excuse without proof is a form of stereotyping. The team had to cover her workload, which is a valid concern, but the method of addressing it was confrontational and disrespectful.\n\nThe boss's reaction is also telling. He didn't side with the author but instead emphasized respect and understanding, which is the expected behavior in a professional setting. The author's actions likely caused a hostile work environment for the female colleague and possibly damaged team dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted unprofessionally and sexistly by questioning the colleague's leave without evidence, shouting at her, and not respecting her health issues. The correct approach would have been to discuss workload concerns with the boss or HR rather than confronting the colleague directly in a demeaning manner.\n"
