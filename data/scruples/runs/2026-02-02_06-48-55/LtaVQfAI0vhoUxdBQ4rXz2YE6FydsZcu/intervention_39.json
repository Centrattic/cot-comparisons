I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for shouting at a woman for taking a week off every month. The situation is in a male-dominated sales team where a new female member started taking weekly leave, which the author perceives as unprofessional. The key points here are about workplace conduct, gender sensitivity, and professional boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he publicly questioned the woman's need for time off by asking for a medical certificate and then shouted at her. This is a clear case of confronting someone in a group setting, which can be very damaging. The boss's response was to tell the author to respect women's pain and be a better man, indicating that the author's approach was inappropriate.\n\nGender dynamics play a role here. The fact that the team is all male and the new female member is being singled out for her leave could point to unconscious bias or a lack of understanding about women's health issues. The author's assumption that the woman's condition is an excuse without any evidence (like a medical certificate) shows a lack of empathy and a dismissive attitude towards her health. The boss's reaction supports the idea that the author's behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful.\n\nWorkplace policies are also a factor. If the boss is okay with the woman taking leave without proof, then the author's insistence on a medical certificate is overstepping his role. It's not his place to question her reasons unless there's a formal policy in place. The author's behavior could create a hostile work environment, which is a serious issue.\n\nThe author's defense is that he doesn't think he was wrong, but the boss's strict hearing and the woman's social media post suggest that his actions were harmful. The key issue here is the public confrontation and the lack of respect for her personal health matters. Even if he had concerns, the appropriate way would be to address them through the proper channels, not by shouting and public questioning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were unprofessional, disrespectful, and contributed to a negative work environment. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
