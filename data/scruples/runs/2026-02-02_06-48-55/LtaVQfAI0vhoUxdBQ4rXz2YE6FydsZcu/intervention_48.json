I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a male coworker who shouted at a female colleague for taking a week off every month, which he suspects is an excuse. He asked for a medical certificate, others told him to let it go, and then he yelled at her. His boss reprimanded him, saying he should respect women's pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman joined the group, which is all male. She took time off for period-related issues, which is a legitimate medical condition. The author questioned her and then shouted, which seems aggressive. The key points here are about professionalism, gender sensitivity, and workplace conduct.\n\nIn many workplaces, especially smaller ones, taking time off for health reasons is standard. Menstrual pain can be severe enough to require time off, and there's a medical term for that (dysmenorrhea). The author's request for a medical certificate is reasonable in some cases, but his approach was confrontational. However, the way he handled it\u2014shouting and accusing her of making excuses\u2014crosses into being disrespectful and potentially discriminatory.\n\nThe boss's reaction makes sense because questioning a female colleague's health in a derogatory manner can come off as sexist. Even if the author didn't mean to be, his actions could be seen as undermining her legitimate health needs. The workplace should foster mutual respect, and singling out a female coworker for taking time off for a condition that affects many women is problematic. The author's behavior might contribute to a hostile work environment and could be considered gender bias.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was reprimanded suggests that the boss sees an issue here. The author might not realize that his actions are part of a broader problem of dismissing women's health concerns. So, even if the author's intentions were to maintain professionalism, his method was inappropriate. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
