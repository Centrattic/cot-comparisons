I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a male coworker who shouted at a female colleague for taking a week off every month, citing period pains and stress. The boss was okay with her taking time off, but the author questioned her and got reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is part of a male-only sales team. A new female colleague joined and became a topic of discussion. She took a week off, which caused extra work for the others. The author asked for a medical certificate, which others advised him to let go. He then shouted at her, calling it unprofessional. The boss reprimanded him, emphasizing respecting women's pain.\n\nFrom a gender equality perspective, taking time off for health reasons should be respected, regardless of gender. The author's reaction seems to imply that her absence is an excuse, which could be seen as dismissive or sexist. The boss's response supports that view, highlighting the need to respect women's health issues. The author's demand for proof might not be unfair in a general sense, but the way he approached it\u2014publicly questioning her and shouting\u2014was inappropriate. Also, the fact that the boss didn't require proof for her absences suggests that the company has a policy allowing such leave, which the author should follow.\n\nThe author's behavior could be seen as part of a broader issue of gender bias. Assuming that a woman's health-related absence is an excuse rather than a legitimate reason is problematic. The other team members advised him to let it go, which might indicate that his reaction was out of line with the team's norms. The Instagram post she made the next day about men not understanding women's issues supports the idea that his comment was insensitive.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he was concerned about unprofessionalism and the team's workload. But even if that's the case, the method of confronting her was inappropriate. There's a difference between addressing work issues professionally and attacking someone's credibility based on their gender. The boss's reprimand and the social media post suggest that the author's actions were wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's shouting and public questioning of her medical reasons in an unprofessional manner, combined with the boss's reaction and the context of gender sensitivity, indicate that he was indeed in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
