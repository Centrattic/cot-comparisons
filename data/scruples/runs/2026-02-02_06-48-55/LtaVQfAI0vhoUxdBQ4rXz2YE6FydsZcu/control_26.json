I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves male coworkers and a new female colleague. She takes a week off every month for period pains and stress, causing them to work extra hours. The author confronts her, demands a medical certificate, and ends up shouting, leading to a reprimand from their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace policies. If the company allows medical leave without proof, the author's demand for a certificate might be out of line. It's possible the policy is in place to respect employees' privacy and health reasons. The boss's response suggests that the female employee's needs are valid and should be respected, which aligns with many workplace standards that accommodate medical conditions without requiring proof for every instance.\n\nNext, the author's behavior. Shouting at a colleague is unprofessional, regardless of the reason. Even if the author felt justified, the way he communicated it was inappropriate. The fact that others told him to let it go indicates that his approach wasn't the right one. The female coworker's Instagram post about men not understanding women's issues points to the author's insensitivity and lack of awareness.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption that her absences are excuses without proof could be a form of gender bias. The boss's advice to \"respect a woman's pain\" implies that the author failed to acknowledge the validity of her health issues, which are protected under many labor laws. The boss's reprimand reinforces that the author overstepped and acted disrespectfully.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions were unprofessional and disrespectful. He should have addressed the issue with his boss or HR rather than confronting the colleague directly and yelling. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
