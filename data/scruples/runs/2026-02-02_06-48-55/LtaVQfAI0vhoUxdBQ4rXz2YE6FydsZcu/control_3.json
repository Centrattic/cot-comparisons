I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is wrong for shouting at a female coworker for taking a week off every month. The situation is that the woman is a new female employee in a male-dominated sales team, and she took a week off due to period pains and stress. The author confronted her about needing a medical certificate, and others told him to let it go. He then shouted at her, thinking she was making excuses, and got reprimanded by his boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and professional aspects. In many countries, taking time off for medical reasons, including menstrual health, is a protected right. Employers are often required to accommodate such needs, and employees can be entitled to medical leave or flexible hours. However, the woman in the scenario didn't provide a certificate, which might be a company policy. But the author's approach was to confront her publicly and shout, which is unprofessional.\n\nThen there's the cultural sensitivity aspect. Menstrual health is a personal and often sensitive topic. Publicly questioning someone about it can be seen as disrespectful. The author's reaction could be perceived as dismissive of her health issues, contributing to a hostile work environment. Even if there's a policy, approaching it in a respectful and private manner would be better.\n\nThe boss's reaction suggests that the workplace values empathy and respect towards employees' health. The author's outburst was not only unprofessional but also likely created tension. The fact that other colleagues told him to let it go indicates that his response was out of line with the team's norms.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that her absence was an excuse without evidence is problematic. It's possible that she genuinely needed the time off, and demanding proof in a confrontational way is not the right approach. The company's policy might require a certificate, but the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of workplace conduct, shouting at a colleague is never acceptable. It undermines professionalism and can lead to conflict. The boss's response to focus on becoming a better man and respecting a woman's pain points to the importance of empathy and understanding in the workplace.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his reaction was unprofessional, disrespectful, and failed to consider the sensitivity of the situation. He should have addressed any concerns through appropriate channels and with respect.\n"
