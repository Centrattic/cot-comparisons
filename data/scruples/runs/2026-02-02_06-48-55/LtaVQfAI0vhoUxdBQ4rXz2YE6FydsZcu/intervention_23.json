I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a male coworker who shouted at a new female colleague for taking a week off every month, which he suspects is an excuse. The boss was okay with her taking the time off, and the author was reprimanded for his outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many countries, taking time off for medical reasons, including period-related issues, might be protected under workplace policies. Employers often require medical certificates for extended absences, but if the company is allowing it without proof, maybe there's a company policy in place. The author's issue is questioning the validity of her absence and confronting her publicly, which could be seen as disrespectful or discriminatory.\n\nThe author's comment about women's issues and shouting at her might be crossing into gender bias. The boss's response about respecting women's pain suggests that the company values a respectful and inclusive environment. Even if there's no proof provided, the manner in which the author approached the situation\u2014publicly challenging her and making a comment about women's problems\u2014could be considered inappropriate and sexist.\n\nAlso, the fact that other coworkers told him to let it go indicates that his reaction was out of line with the group's tolerance. The boss's reprimand is a clear sign that the author's actions were unprofessional. Even if there's no medical certificate, it's not his place to question a colleague's medical decisions in that way. The author should have addressed concerns through proper channels, like discussing with management rather than confronting her directly and publicly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were unprofessional and likely based on gender bias. He's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation appropriately, showed disrespect, and violated a respectful workplace culture.\n"
