I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for shouting at a woman for taking a week off every month. The scenario is that the woman joined a male sales team, and she took a week off due to period pains and stress, which caused the team to work extra hours. The author questioned her about needing a medical certificate and ended up shouting at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace policies and discrimination laws. In many places, taking time off for health-related issues, including menstrual pain, is protected under health and safety regulations. The author's reaction might be seen as discriminatory or lacking empathy. \n\nThe boss's response to the author was about respecting women's pain, which suggests the company values a supportive environment. The author's demand for proof without considering the sensitivity of the issue could be unprofessional. Also, the fact that the boss didn't require proof for her absence but the author did shows a misunderstanding of the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the team dynamics. The woman is new, and the author's outburst might have created a hostile work environment. Even if the author felt she was slacking, the approach was confrontational and disrespectful. The boss's reprimand indicates that the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he was concerned about team workload. But the correct approach would be to discuss it professionally with management, not confront her directly. The author's method of handling it\u2014shouting in a lunch setting\u2014is unprofessional regardless.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were inappropriate. He didn't handle the situation with the necessary tact and respect for her health issues. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
