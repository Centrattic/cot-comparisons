I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a male coworker shouting at a female colleague for taking a week off every month, which he attributes to period pains and stress. The key points here are about professionalism, workplace conduct, and gender dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he publicly questioned her need for time off without medical proof and then shouted at her. That's a clear breach of appropriate workplace behavior. Even if he had concerns, the way he addressed them was inappropriate. Yelling and publicly questioning her without evidence can be seen as harassment or discrimination. \n\nThen there's the context of the workplace being all-male with a new female employee. The author's comments might be influenced by gender bias. Assuming that a woman's health issues are excuses rather than legitimate reasons can reflect a lack of understanding or respect for women's health. The boss's response to \"respect a woman's pain\" suggests that the company values sensitivity towards gender-related issues.\n\nThe author's justification that others told him to let it go and the Instagram post he saw about men not understanding women's problems might indicate that he was aware of potential gender bias but dismissed it. However, that doesn't excuse his behavior. The fact that the boss didn't require proof for her time off also implies that her absence was handled internally, and the author's public confrontation was unprofessional.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, workplace policies usually prohibit discrimination and harassment. The author's actions could be seen as both. Even if the underlying issue was a scheduling problem, the method of addressing it was flawed. He should have discussed it privately with the appropriate authority (like the boss) rather than confronting her directly in a public and aggressive manner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful. He didn't handle the situation appropriately, and the boss's reprimand is justified. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
