I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for shouting at a woman who takes a week off every month for period pains and stress. The scenario is a small hygiene business with all male salesmen, and a female colleague joined. The author feels that her taking a week off is causing them to work extra hours and he asked for a medical certificate, then shouted at her because he thought it was an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The female employee is taking time off due to health issues related to her periods. In many places, menstrual health is a legitimate medical reason for absence. Employers might handle this with sensitivity, and colleagues should respect that. The author's approach of questioning her with a medical certificate and then shouting seems inappropriate. \n\nLegally, in some countries, period-related absences might be covered under sick leave or protected by anti-discrimination laws. The author's public shaming and demanding proof in a confrontational way could be seen as discriminatory or disrespectful. The boss's response to \"respect a woman's pain\" aligns with promoting a respectful workplace. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's just being professional and that others told him to let it go. However, the way he handled it\u2014shouting and questioning her without proper context\u2014crosses into unprofessional behavior. The fact that the female employee posted about men not understanding women's issues suggests that the author's actions were perceived as dismissive or sexist.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for his reaction. The correct answer is A.\n"
