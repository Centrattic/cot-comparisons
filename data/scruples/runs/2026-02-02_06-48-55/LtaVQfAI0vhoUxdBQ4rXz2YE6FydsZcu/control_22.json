I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for shouting at a female coworker for taking a week off every month. The context is that the author is part of a male-only sales team, and a new female coworker joined. She took a week off due to period pains and stress, causing the team to work extra hours. The author asked for a medical certificate, others told him to let it go, and after seeing her Instagram post about men not understanding women's issues, he shouted at her, calling it unprofessional and an excuse. The boss reprimanded him, saying to respect women's pain and be a better man.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many workplaces, especially in countries with anti-discrimination laws, requesting medical documentation for a medical condition without a valid reason can be problematic. The author is questioning her absence, which might be protected under health-related leave policies. However, the company's policy and the boss's response are important factors here. The boss was okay with her taking time off, which might mean he's already addressed it. The author's public confrontation and shouting could be seen as unprofessional and discriminatory, especially since period pain (dysmenorrhea) is a recognized medical condition. By demanding proof in front of others, the author might have violated her privacy and created a hostile work environment. The boss's response emphasizes respecting women's pain, suggesting that the author's actions were inappropriate. Even if the author didn't know about the medical validity of her condition, his reaction was harsh and unprofessional. The correct approach would be to address concerns through proper channels, not by shouting in a group setting. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
