I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a male colleague who shouted at a female coworker for taking a week off every month, presumably for her period. The author questioned her about needing a medical certificate, others told him to let it go, and then he got in trouble from his boss.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is part of a male-only sales team, a woman joined, and she took time off for period-related issues. The author thinks she's making an excuse, so he confronts her, leading to a shouting incident. The boss reprimanded him, saying to respect women's pain. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? The author's actions involved questioning her without proof, shouting, and not respecting her privacy. Legally and ethically, questioning someone's medical leave without evidence can be problematic. There's also the aspect of gender bias. Menstrual leave is a real thing in some places, though it varies by country. The author's approach was confrontational and public, which isn't professional. The boss's response suggests that the company values respect and empathy towards employees' health issues.\n\nThe author's mistake was not only the shouting but also making assumptions about her condition without evidence. Even if there's a policy requiring medical certificates, the way he approached her was unprofessional. The boss's reaction indicates that the company expects respect for personal health matters, especially gender-specific issues.\n\nAdditionally, the author's coworkers told him to let it go, which might mean he overstepped by bringing it up. Publicly questioning her on lunch and then shouting is a breach of professional behavior. The fact that he didn't have proof himself (like a medical certificate) but still accused her shows a lack of due process.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he acted unprofessionally, made assumptions, and didn't respect her privacy and health. The correct answer is A.\n"
