I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a male coworker shouting at a female colleague for taking a week off every month due to period pain, which caused the team to work extra hours. The author was reprimanded by their boss for not respecting women's health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many workplaces, especially in places with anti-discrimination laws, taking time off for medical reasons, including menstrual pain, should be handled with confidentiality and support. The female employee might have a legitimate medical need, and the author's public questioning and shouting could be seen as discriminatory or hostile.\n\nAlso, the author's request for a medical certificate might be inappropriate unless the company has a formal policy requiring such documentation for certain absences. The boss's response about respecting women's pain indicates that the company values a supportive environment, so the author's actions likely violated that.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the team is all male might contribute to a lack of understanding about women's health issues. The author's reaction, especially in a group setting, could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. Even if the author believes the absence is an excuse, it's not his place to question her without proper channels or evidence. The boss's reprimand suggests that the company sides with the female employee, so the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
