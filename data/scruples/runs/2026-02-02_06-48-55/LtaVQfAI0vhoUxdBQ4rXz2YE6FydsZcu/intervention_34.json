My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a male-only sales group in a small hygiene business. A female colleague joined, and the author found her attractive and interesting, which made her the center of discussions. Then, she took a week off for period pains and stress, which caused the team to fall behind. The author, along with the team, had to work extra hours to cover for her. The boss allowed this. The author confronted her by asking for a medical certificate, thinking it was an excuse. After others told him to let it go and she posted about men not understanding women's issues, he shouted at her, calling her unprofessional. The boss then reprimanded him, saying he should respect women's pain and be a better man.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is the author's reaction to the female colleague taking time off for medical reasons. The author questioned her without proof, which led to a confrontation and shouting. The boss's response implies that the author's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, there's the matter of respecting personal medical issues. Women's health issues, including period pain (dysmenorrhea), are legitimate and can sometimes require medical attention. Assuming someone is faking their condition without evidence is not only disrespectful but also perpetuates stigma around women's health. The author's demand for a medical certificate in a public setting (during lunch) and then confronting her with accusations could be seen as invasive and unprofessional.\n\nThen, there's the team dynamic. The author is part of a male-only group, which might contribute to a lack of understanding of women's health issues. The fact that the boss allowed her time off suggests that there was some awareness or policy in place. However, the author's public confrontation and shouting in a professional setting is unprofessional behavior regardless of the reason. It could create a hostile work environment and damage team cohesion.\n\nThe boss's reprimand is significant. The boss's statement about respecting women's pain and becoming a better man indicates that the author's actions were against company values or acceptable workplace behavior. Even if the author believed the female colleague wasn't providing proof, confronting her in such a manner was inappropriate. The author should have addressed concerns through proper channels, perhaps talking to the boss privately rather than confronting her directly.\n\nAnother point is the assumption made by the author. He assumed she was making an excuse without any evidence. This is a classic example of gaslighting or questioning someone's health without proof, which is not acceptable. It's important to trust employees' reasons for taking time off unless there's a company policy requiring documentation, which the author didn't mention. Even if there was a policy, the way he handled it was confrontational and disrespectful.\n\nThe fact that others advised him to let it go suggests that the team might have recognized the sensitivity of the situation. The female colleague's Instagram post about men not understanding women's issues the next day indicates that her experience was hurtful, which the author's actions likely contributed to.\n\nIn terms of workplace policies, if there's a standard for medical leave, it should be applied consistently. However, the author's approach was not in line with professional conduct. Shouting in a professional setting is a clear violation of workplace behavior norms.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were unprofessional and disrespectful. He questioned a colleague's legitimate health reasons without evidence, created a hostile environment, and was reprimanded by his boss. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
