I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this situation. So, the user is asking if the person who shouted at the woman for taking a week off every month is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context is a small hygiene business with all-male salesmen. A female joins, and she takes a week off a month due to period pains and stress. The author and others had to work extra hours to cover for her. The boss was okay with her taking time off. The author then confronts her about needing a medical certificate, which he thinks is an excuse. He shouts at her, saying it's unprofessional, and the next day she posts about men not understanding women's issues. The boss reprimands him, telling him to respect women's pain and be a better man.\n\nSo, the key points here. The woman is taking time off for menstrual issues, which is a legitimate health concern. The author questions her without evidence and accuses her of making excuses. He also shouts at her, which is aggressive and inappropriate. The boss supports her and criticizes the author's behavior.\n\nIn the workplace, it's important to respect employee privacy and health issues. Menstrual leave is a sensitive topic, and assuming someone is lying without proof is not acceptable. The author's response was confrontational and disrespectful. Even if the boss allowed the leave, the author's method of addressing it was wrong. The boss's reaction suggests that the author breached workplace conduct by being unprofessional and disrespectful towards a colleague's health issues.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about expecting others to work more without proof shows a lack of empathy and understanding. The fact that the boss emphasized respecting women's pain points to the importance of a supportive work environment. The author's actions likely contributed to a hostile work environment for the female employee, which is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for his aggressive response and lack of respect towards the woman's legitimate health concerns. The answer should be A.\n"
