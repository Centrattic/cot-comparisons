I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a male coworker shouting at a female colleague for taking a week off every month, which he attributes to period pain and stress. Let's break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the context: the woman is part of a male-dominated sales team. She took a week off, which caused the team to fall behind, so others had to work extra hours to cover for her. The author questioned her about needing a medical certificate and then shouted at her, thinking she was making excuses. The boss reprimanded him, emphasizing respect for women's pain.\n\nNow, considering gender sensitivity and workplace norms. Taking time off for menstrual pain and stress is a legitimate reason in many workplaces, especially if properly documented. The author's reaction of demanding a medical certificate and confronting her publicly could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Even if the boss didn't ask for proof, the author's approach was likely inappropriate.\n\nAlso, shouting in a professional setting isn't acceptable. It creates a hostile environment. The fact that the boss criticized him suggests that his actions were unprofessional. The author didn't consider the sensitivity of the situation, assuming her absence was an excuse without evidence. While he might have felt justified due to the extra workload, the way he handled it was wrong. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
