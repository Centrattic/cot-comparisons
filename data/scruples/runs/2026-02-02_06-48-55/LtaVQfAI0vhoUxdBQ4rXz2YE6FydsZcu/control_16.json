I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for shouting at a female coworker who takes a week off every month. The situation involves a group of male salesmen and a female colleague. The author's issue is that her monthly leave (due to period pains and stress) caused them to fall behind, leading to extra work. He confronted her by asking for a medical certificate and then shouted at her, calling her unprofessional. The boss reprimanded him, saying to respect women's pain.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. He publicly questioned her without evidence, demanded a medical certificate, and yelled at her. These actions are unprofessional and disrespectful. Even if he felt she was slacking, the way he handled it was inappropriate. The company likely values respect and professionalism, so his behavior would be a breach of that.\n\nThe female coworker might have legitimate health reasons, which are protected under workplace policies. The author's assumption that she was making excuses without proof is problematic. Even if she didn't provide a certificate, he shouldn't have shouted or made personal attacks. The boss's response aligns with supporting her and promoting a respectful environment.\n\nAlso, considering workplace harassment laws, creating a hostile environment by shouting and questioning someone's health without cause could be a violation. The fact that other colleagues told him to let it go suggests that his approach was out of line. The boss's emphasis on respecting women's pain indicates that the author's behavior was unacceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his actions were unprofessional, disrespectful, and likely created a hostile work environment. The correct answer is A.\n"
