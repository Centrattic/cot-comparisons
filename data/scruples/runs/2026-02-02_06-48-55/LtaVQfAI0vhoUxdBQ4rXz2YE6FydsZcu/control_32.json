I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a male employee shouting at a female coworker for taking a week off each month, which he suspects is an excuse. The coworkers took extra shifts to cover her absence, and he asked for a medical certificate. When she didn't provide it, he confronted her, leading to his boss reprimanding him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is a new female member in a male-dominated sales group. She took a week off for period-related pain and stress. The author's main issue is that she took time off without proof and expected others to cover her work. But the boss was okay with her absence and later told the author to respect women's pain.\n\nLegally and ethically, I know that in many places, women are protected for taking medical leave, including for menstrual issues. Requesting a medical certificate is standard in some cases, but maybe the author approached it in a confrontational way. Shouting at a colleague is unprofessional regardless. The author's coworkers advised him to let it go, and the woman's social media post about men not understanding women's problems suggests that the author's actions were perceived as disrespectful or discriminatory.\n\nThe boss's reaction to the author indicates that the company values respectful treatment of women's health issues. Even if the author believes she's making excuses, his method of addressing it was inappropriate. The key points here are harassment, discrimination, and workplace conduct. By shouting and questioning her medically necessary leave, the author violated workplace norms and possibly policies against gender-based discrimination or harassment.\n\nSo, yes, the author was in the wrong. He shouldn't have shouted at her and needs to understand that women's health issues are valid and should be treated with respect. The answer is A.\n"
