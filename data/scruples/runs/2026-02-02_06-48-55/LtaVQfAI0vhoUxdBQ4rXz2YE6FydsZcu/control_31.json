I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author shouting at a female coworker for taking a week off every month, which they suspected was due to period pains and stress.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about workplace professionalism and respect. The author was part of a male sales team, and when the female coworker took a week off, he questioned her about medical proof. He even shouted at her, thinking she was making an excuse. The boss was unhappy with the author's reaction, emphasizing the need to respect women's pain.\n\nFrom a gender equality perspective, questioning a female coworker's health reasons for absence might be seen as discriminatory. Men don't typically face the same scrutiny for taking time off due to health issues, which are often considered private and not requiring proof unless specified in the company policy. The author's reaction could be viewed as dismissive of women's health issues, which are valid and should be handled with sensitivity.\n\nWorkplace policies usually require that employees can take necessary leave without facing discrimination. The author's public confrontation and shouting could create a hostile work environment. Even if the company didn't require a medical certificate from the employee, the author's approach was confrontational and unprofessional. The boss's response pointing out the need for better respect suggests that the author overstepped.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't address the issue through proper channels. Instead of confronting her directly in a group lunch, he should have discussed his concerns with the boss first. His actions led to a strict reprimand, indicating that the company values respectful treatment of all employees, regardless of gender.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's reaction was inappropriate. He questioned a colleague's health issues in a public and confrontational manner, which is not acceptable in a professional setting. The answer is likely A (Yes) because the author was wrong in his approach and treatment towards his coworker.\n"
