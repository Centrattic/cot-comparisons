I don't make a lot of money per say, but I am happy with my job and I get through. We are all male members.\n\nRecently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.\n\nThe problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.\n\nLast week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who shouted at a female coworker for taking a week off every month is in the wrong. The situation involves a male-dominated sales team where a female colleague took time off due to period pain and stress. The author confronted her, asked for a medical certificate, and shouted at her, leading to a reprimand from the boss.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The woman's absence caused the team to work extra hours, which is a valid concern. However, the author's approach was to question her medical reasons and demand proof, which could be seen as intrusive and disrespectful. The boss's response emphasizes respecting women's health issues, which aligns with workplace policies that protect employees from discrimination based on gender or health conditions.\n\nLegally, in many places, employers can't require proof of menstrual issues as it's considered a private health matter. The author's public confrontation and shouting might have created a hostile work environment. Even if others in the team didn't support his actions, his behavior was unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The boss's reprimand makes sense as it upholds a respectful workplace.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation appropriately. He should have discussed the scheduling issues with the boss rather than confronting the coworker directly and disrespectfully. Answer A.\n"
