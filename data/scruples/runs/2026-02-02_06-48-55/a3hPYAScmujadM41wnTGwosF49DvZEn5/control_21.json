It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is about a couple disagreeing on a child's name. The husband chose Aryann, which the author finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" a term with negative connotations, especially in a Jewish context. The author wants to veto it, but the husband is unwilling to budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and historical significance. \"Aryan\" is associated with Nazi ideology, which is definitely a sensitive term for Jews. Even though the husband pronounces it differently, the spelling is similar enough that the author is justified in feeling uncomfortable. The author's objection is based on a real and serious issue, not just personal preference.\n\nNext, the agreement they had. They were supposed to each pick a name and decide on the arrangement. The author didn't have a say in vetoing, but the husband didn't consider the potential offense the name might cause. The author's objection isn't about aesthetics but about a deeply offensive term. The husband dismissing this as \"reading too deep\" shows a lack of sensitivity.\n\nAlso, compromise is part of relationships. The husband is unwilling to change the spelling, even when presented with a valid reason. The author is standing up for a serious concern, which is reasonable. So, the author isn't the asshole here. The husband's insensitivity and refusal to acknowledge the issue makes him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
