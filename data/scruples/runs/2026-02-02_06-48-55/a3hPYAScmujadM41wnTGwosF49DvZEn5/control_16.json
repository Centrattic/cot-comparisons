It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The couple agreed to each pick a name and decide the arrangement. The husband chose Aryann, pronounced Ah-ree-ann. The author is Jewish and finds the name too similar to \"Aryan,\" which has very negative connotations, especially in that context. The husband is resistant to changing the spelling, thinking it's just a name and people won't notice.\n\nFirst, the author's objection is based on the name's similarity to a term associated with white supremacy and has a strong historical and cultural sensitivity, especially for Jewish people given the Holocaust. Even if the pronunciation is different, the spelling is very close and could cause discomfort or be misunderstood. The husband seems to dismiss her feelings, which is a red flag. In a partnership, respecting each other's values and concerns is key. The author is standing up for her principles and her family's history, which is valid. The husband's insistence on keeping the name despite her objection could be seen as not valuing her perspective. So, the author isn't in the wrong here; she's justified in her stance.\n"
