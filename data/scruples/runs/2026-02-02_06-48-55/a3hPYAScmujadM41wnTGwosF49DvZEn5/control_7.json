It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's chosen name for their child. The husband picked \"Aryann,\" which the author finds problematic because it's too close to \"Aryan,\" given their Jewish background. The husband doesn't see the issue and won't budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had agreed to each pick a name and then decide the arrangement. The author didn't think there would be any issues, but when the husband's choice came up, she found it offensive. Her concern is valid because \"Aryan\" has negative historical connotations, especially in the context of Jewish history and the Holocaust. The term \"Aryan\" was used by Nazis to promote white supremacy, so any name that's a close variation could be seen as insensitive or offensive.\n\nThe husband, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and thinks the spelling is different enough. He's focused on the aesthetics of the name. But the author is prioritizing the meaning and historical context, which is a legitimate concern. They had a prior agreement, but there was no mention of a veto. However, since they were each choosing names, it's reasonable for the author to have a say in the final selection, especially when it's something that causes her distress.\n\nThe key points here are respect for each other's values and the agreement they made. The author is standing up for her values and the couple's agreement, even if it means going against her husband's choice. The husband's refusal to budge despite her valid concerns could be seen as dismissive. Since both parents should be involved in the decision and agree on the name, the author is in the right to ask for a change. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
