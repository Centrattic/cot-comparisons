It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child, Aryann, because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which is a sensitive term given her Jewish background.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple agreed to each pick a name and then decide on the arrangement. The husband chose Aryann, pronounced Ah-ree-ann. The author is upset because \"Aryan\" has negative connotations, especially in Jewish history. The husband isn't budging and thinks she's overreacting.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the name choice and the sensitivity around it. The author's concern is valid because \"Aryan\" is associated with Nazi ideology and anti-Semitism. Even if the husband didn't intend any harm, using a name that sounds similar could be triggering or offensive to someone with a Jewish background. The fact that the author is Jewish adds weight to her objection.\n\nThe husband's stance is that the name looks pretty and he doesn't think people will notice the similarity. But that's dismissing the author's feelings and the historical context. It's about respecting her values and the significance she attaches to the name choice. Since they had a prior agreement to each choose a name, but didn't discuss vetoes, the author is now stepping in because the name is problematic for her.\n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider both partners' perspectives. However, the author's reason for objecting is based on a legitimate cultural and historical issue. The husband not being open to changing the spelling or the name shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing her ground here. The answer should be B, meaning she's not the asshole.\n"
