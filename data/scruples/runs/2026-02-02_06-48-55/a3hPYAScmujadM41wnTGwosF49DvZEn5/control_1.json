It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's choice of the name Aryann for their daughter. The key points here are the name's similarity to \"Aryan,\" which has problematic historical connotations, especially in the context of the author being Jewish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind the author's objection. She's concerned about the name's association with a term that's historically tied to racism and genocide. That's a valid concern, especially given her background. The husband, on the other hand, seems to not see the issue and is resistant to changing the spelling. \n\nThe situation mentions they had a rough agreement to each pick a name and decide on the arrangement without discussing vetoes. The author didn't think she'd hate his choice, but this name is a problem. So, she's standing her ground, which is about respecting her values and history.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or ethical obligation that makes the author's stance unreasonable. Since the name's similarity to a term with such negative history is a legitimate issue, especially when one parent is from an affected community, her objection is justified. The husband's dismissal of her concerns might be the issue here, but the question is about the author's right to veto. \n\nIs there a scenario where she's overstepping? Maybe not, because it's about a deeply offensive term from her perspective. The compromise of changing the spelling was suggested, but he refused. In many cases, when a name choice is offensive to one parent's cultural or personal values, the other parent should respect that. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
