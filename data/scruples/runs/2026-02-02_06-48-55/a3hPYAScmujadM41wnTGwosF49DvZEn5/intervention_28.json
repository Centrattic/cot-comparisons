It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's name choice for their child. The husband chose \"Aryann,\" which she finds problematic because it's too similar to \"Aryan,\" a term with negative connotations, especially given her Jewish background. She tried to change the spelling, but he won't budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's concern is about the potential association with \"Aryan,\" which has a very dark history related to the Holocaust and racism. For someone Jewish, this could be a sensitive issue. She might feel that using a name even slightly similar could be offensive or bring unwanted attention or misunderstanding. On the other hand, her husband thinks it's a pretty name and that people won't think twice about it. He might not see the connection she does.\n\nNow, the key here is whether either party overstepped. They had an agreement to each pick a name and decide the arrangement, but they didn't discuss vetoes. She didn't realize he would pick something she'd dislike. The husband is unwilling to compromise, which might be an issue. However, the author is standing her ground based on her personal and cultural background. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The husband didn't consider her feelings regarding the name's implications, which shows a lack of sensitivity. The author, on the other hand, is asserting her values, which are important for her family's identity. Since they had an agreement without vetoes, she might be overstepping by vetoing, but considering the offensive connotation she perceives, her stance is understandable. \n\nBut the question is about who's wrong. If the husband is unwilling to budge and the author is standing up for her beliefs, maybe the husband is the one in the wrong for not being flexible. However, the author did suggest changing the spelling, which the husband rejected. If the author had no prior knowledge of his name choice and it's causing her significant distress, she's justified in vetoing it, especially considering the historical context. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's reasons are valid and based on her cultural background. The husband's name choice is problematic from her perspective, and she's trying to protect her family from potential negative associations. Therefore, the author isn't the one in the wrong here.\n"
