It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The husband picked \"Aryann,\" which the author finds problematic because it sounds similar to \"Aryan,\" a term associated with white supremacy, especially given her Jewish background. The husband won't budge, thinking she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's objection is based on historical and cultural sensitivity, which is valid. The term \"Aryan\" has a very negative connotation, especially in Jewish communities due to the Holocaust. Even if the husband doesn't see the connection, the author's feelings are legitimate. The husband's refusal to change the spelling despite her concerns might be seen as dismissive of her valid reasons.\n\nNext, the agreement they had was each picking a name and combining them, but they didn't discuss vetoes. However, the author didn't realize there would be something he chose that she'd hate. Since they both have the right to be comfortable with the child's name, especially when there's a cultural sensitivity involved, it's reasonable for her to want to veto it.\n\nAlso, the husband's attitude that \"no one will think twice\" might be ignoring the potential for unintended associations. The author's stance is about protecting their child from any negative connotations and respecting her background. So, the answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
