It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about vetoing their husband's name choice is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: They were supposed to each pick a name and decide the arrangement. The husband chose \"Aryann,\" which the wife finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" a term with strong negative connotations, especially in Jewish history. She's Jewish, so this is a valid concern. The husband, however, doesn't see the issue and insists on the name.\n\nThe key points here are about shared names, personal values, and mutual agreement. When naming a child, both parents usually have a say, and it's important that both feel comfortable. The term \"Aryan\" is associated with Nazi ideology and the Holocaust, which is a significant problem for Jewish people. The wife's objection is rooted in her cultural and religious sensitivity. Even if the husband doesn't see the connection, her feelings are legitimate. \n\nThe husband's stance that \"no one will think twice\" ignores the deeper meaning and historical context. The wife is standing up for her values and her family's history, which is a reasonable and responsible action. Since they had a prior agreement to each choose a name but not to veto each other's choices, the wife is technically going against that. However, the husband didn't consider the implications of his choice, possibly not doing enough research. \n\nBut wait, the original agreement wasn't about vetoes. She didn't discuss that possibility beforehand. However, the husband also didn't consider the cultural sensitivity of the name. The wife's objection is about a serious issue, so her refusal is justified despite the prior agreement. The husband's choice was problematic, so her standing up for her beliefs makes her not the asshole. \n\nAnswer B.\n"
