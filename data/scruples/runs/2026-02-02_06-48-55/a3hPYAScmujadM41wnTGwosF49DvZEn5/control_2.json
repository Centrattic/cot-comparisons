It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their daughter. The name he chose is Aryann, which the author finds problematic because it's similar to \"Aryan,\" which has negative associations, especially given her Jewish background. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had an agreement where each would pick a name and then decide the arrangement. The author didn't anticipate a name she would hate so much. The husband is insistent on Aryann, thinking it's just a pretty name. The author is objecting due to the possible connotations.\n\nI should think about the reasons behind the author's objection. \"Aryan\" is historically linked to Nazi ideology and white supremacy, which is a significant issue for Jewish people. Even if the pronunciation is different, the spelling similarity might still cause concern. The husband dismissing her feelings as \"reading too deep\" could be problematic. It's important to respect each other's sensitivities in such matters, especially when the child's name is involved.\n\nAlso, the initial agreement didn't mention vetoes, but the situation shows that the author is standing her ground. The key here is whether the author's objection is valid. Given the historical and cultural context, her refusal to accept the name Aryann seems reasonable. The husband not budging might be the real issue here, as he's not considering her valid concerns. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to veto the name because her concerns are based on significant ethical and cultural considerations. The husband's dismissal of her feelings is more of the problem. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
