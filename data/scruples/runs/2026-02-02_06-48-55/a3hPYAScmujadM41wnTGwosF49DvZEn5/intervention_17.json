It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's chosen name for their child. The husband wanted the name Aryann, which the wife finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially considering her Jewish background. The husband doesn't see the issue and won't change the spelling. The wife is asking if she's the asshole for standing her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband proposed a method where they each pick a name and decide which is first or middle. They didn't discuss vetoes, so maybe the wife didn't expect this. The name Aryann is pronounced Ah-ree-ann, but it's spelled differently. The wife's issue is the similarity to \"Aryan,\" which she finds offensive. The husband thinks it's just a pretty name and that people won't think about the connotations.\n\nNow, considering the wife's background, being Jewish, the term \"Aryan\" has a deeply negative history, especially related to Nazi ideology. Even if the spelling is different, the similarity might cause discomfort or unintended associations. The husband, on the other hand, might not realize the depth of the issue or might not see the connection. Cultural sensitivity is important here. The wife is standing up for her values and her family's history, which is significant. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. If they agreed on a process where they each pick a name and decide the arrangement, but didn't discuss vetoes, then maybe she overstepped by vetoing without prior agreement. However, if the name choice is deeply offensive to her, maybe it's reasonable to reconsider. \n\nThe key points are: prior agreement on the process, cultural sensitivity, and the potential for the name to have negative connotations. The wife's reason is based on her identity and history, which is a strong point. The husband's insistence on the name despite her objection could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn many cases, when it comes to names, both parents usually have a say, especially when one parent feels strongly about it. The wife's stance is about a serious historical and cultural issue. Even without a prior veto agreement, if the name causes significant discomfort, it's reasonable for her to object. So maybe the husband is in the wrong here for not considering her perspective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
