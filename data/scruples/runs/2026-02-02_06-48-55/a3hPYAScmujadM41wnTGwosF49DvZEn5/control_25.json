It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The husband picked \"Aryann,\" which the author finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially given her Jewish background. The husband refuses to change the spelling, thinking it's just a pretty name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a method where each picked a name and then decided on the arrangement. The author didn't think there would be a conflict, but this name is an issue for her. The key point here is the sensitivity around the name's similarity to a term associated with white supremacism. For someone with a Jewish background, this would be a serious concern.\n\nThe husband's stance is that he doesn't see the problem and thinks the author is overreacting. But the author is justified in feeling that the name could have unintended associations. It's important to respect each other's values and sensitivities in such a decision. Since the name choice is a major decision and the author has a valid reason based on her background, her veto seems reasonable. The husband's refusal to budge despite her valid concerns might be the issue here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for standing by her principles. Given that the name could cause harm or offense, the author isn't the asshole. So the answer should be B.\n"
