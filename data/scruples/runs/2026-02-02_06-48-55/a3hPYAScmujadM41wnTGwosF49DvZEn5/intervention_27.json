It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name he picked is Aryann, pronounced Ah-ree-ann. The author is Jewish and finds the name too similar to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations due to its association with Nazi ideology. The husband is resistant to changing the spelling, thinking it's just a pretty name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband wanted to choose Aryann, maybe because he found the spelling attractive. The wife feels it's too close to Aryan, which is a term that's historically tied to white supremacy. From her perspective, using a name that sounds like Aryan could be problematic, especially for a Jewish family. She's pushing back because of the historical context and potential negative implications.\n\nThe husband, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue. He thinks the name is just a name and that others won't think twice about it. He's not considering the deeper historical meaning, which is a significant concern for the wife. The original agreement was to each pick a name and then decide on the arrangement, but neither discussed the possibility of a veto. The wife is now vetoing it, which the husband might feel was against the initial agreement.\n\nBut here's the thing: when it comes to naming a child, parents have the right to make decisions based on their values and beliefs. The wife's objection isn't just about personal dislike; it's about a name that could be misinterpreted or associated with harmful ideologies. Even if the husband doesn't see it that way, her concern is valid because of the historical context. The name \"Aryan\" has a problematic past, and using a similar-sounding name could lead to unintended associations.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't discuss vetoes doesn't mean she can't have one. The initial agreement was flexible, and if one parent's choice causes a significant issue, it's reasonable to reconsider. The husband's insistence on the name despite the wife's valid concerns might make him the one being unreasonable here.\n\nSo, in this case, the author (the wife) is standing up for her beliefs and the potential negative implications of the name. She's not just being picky; she's addressing a serious issue related to historical trauma and social perception. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for wanting to veto it.\n"
