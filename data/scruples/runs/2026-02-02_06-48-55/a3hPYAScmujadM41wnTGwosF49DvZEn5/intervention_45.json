It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child, Aryann. The husband had chosen it, and the author objects because it's too close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially since she's Jewish. The husband isn't budging, thinking she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had an agreement where each would choose a name and they'd decide the arrangement. The author didn't think there would be a deal-breaker. The husband's name is Aryann, which the author finds problematic. The key issue here is the cultural and historical sensitivity of the name \"Aryan,\" which is associated with white supremacy, especially in the context of Holocaust history. For a Jewish person, that name would have strong negative associations.\n\nThe author is standing her ground because of her personal and cultural values. The husband, on the other hand, sees it as a pretty name without the negative connotations. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing it. \n\nIn such cases, when a name has offensive connotations to one parent's culture or religion, it's reasonable for that parent to object. The husband may not realize the depth of the issue, but the author's perspective is valid given her background. The compromise attempted (changing the spelling) was rejected by the husband, so the author is asking him to choose another name. \n\nIn most discussions about such matters, the person who objects based on significant historical or cultural reasons isn't considered the \"asshole\" if they stand their ground. The husband's insistence on using a name that's offensive to a spouse's culture would be problematic. Therefore, the author is justified in her stance, so the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
