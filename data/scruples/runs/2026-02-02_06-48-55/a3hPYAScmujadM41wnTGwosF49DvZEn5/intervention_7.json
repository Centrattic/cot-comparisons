It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's chosen name, Aryann, because it's too close to \"Aryan,\" which has problematic connotations, especially given their Jewish background.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband and wife were supposed to each pick a name and then decide on first/middle. The husband chose Aryann, which the wife finds problematic due to its similarity to Aryan. She tried suggesting changing the spelling, but he won't budge. The key points here are the personal history (Jewish background), the emotional weight of the name, and the agreement they had.\n\nThe husband argues that no one will think twice about the name, but the wife's objection is valid because of the historical and cultural implications. Even if others might not notice, for someone with a Jewish background, the association with Aryan is deeply troubling. It's about respecting each other's values and sensitivities in a relationship. If they had agreed to each choose a name, then the husband's choice should consider his partner's feelings. The wife's veto is based on a legitimate concern, and the husband's refusal to budge despite her valid reason could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she's standing up for her values. So the answer should be B.\n"
