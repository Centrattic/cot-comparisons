It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a couple disagreeing on their child's name. The husband chose \"Aryann,\" pronounced Ah-ree-ann, and the wife, who is Jewish, vetoes it because it's too similar to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially in the context of the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. The husband doesn't see the issue, thinking it's just a pretty name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband probably put a lot of thought into the name, maybe likes the sound of it. He might feel like his choice is being rejected without understanding his perspective. But the wife's concern is valid given the historical context. The name \"Aryann\" could be problematic because it's close enough to \"Aryan\" that some people might associate it with that ideology. Even if the intention is pure, the association could lead to unintended offense or confusion.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's Jewish background, which makes the issue more sensitive, and the fact that the name is a close variant of a term with deeply offensive history. Even if the husband doesn't see the problem, the wife has a legitimate reason to feel uncomfortable. In such cases, mutual respect and compromise are important. Since the husband is resistant to changing the spelling, the wife is justified in vetoing the name to avoid something that causes her such distress.\n\nIn relationships, when there's a strong emotional or ethical issue involved, the person raising it is usually right to prioritize their feelings. The husband's stance might be seen as dismissing her serious concern, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong here; she's standing up for a significant issue that affects her identity and values.\n"
