It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's choice of the name Aryann for their daughter. \n\nFirst, the context: They had a system where each chose a name, and then decided which would be first or middle based on arrangement. No vetoes were discussed beforehand. The husband chose Aryann, which the author finds problematic because it's similar to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially given her Jewish background. The husband thinks she's overreacting and won't budge on the spelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the names' implications, the cultural sensitivity, and the agreement they had. The author is standing her ground because of the association with a term that's historically problematic, especially in Jewish history. The husband, on the other hand, sees it as a pretty name without the same connotations.\n\nNow, considering that they had an agreement to each pick a name and decide on arrangement, the author is trying to follow through by objecting to the name she finds offensive. Since they didn't discuss vetoes, but the author is using her right to dislike the name due to its association, it's a matter of whether her stance is reasonable. \n\nGiven that the name's similarity to \"Aryan\" can be seen as insensitive, especially in a Jewish context, her objection is valid. The husband not changing the spelling despite her concerns might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here because she's standing up for her values and the name's implication, which is a legitimate concern.\n"
