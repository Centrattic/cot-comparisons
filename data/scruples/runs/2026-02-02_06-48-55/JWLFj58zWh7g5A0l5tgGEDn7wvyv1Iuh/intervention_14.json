I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a clogged toilet that they tried to fix themselves. The boyfriend was lying down while the author's dad fixed it. The author is upset because the boyfriend didn't help and was ungrateful. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't do anything because he disagreed with how the author's dad was fixing it, and he thought it wasn't that urgent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the social norms here. When someone helps you, especially with something as unpleasant as fixing a toilet, it's expected to show gratitude and at least some level of engagement. The boyfriend was lying down and didn't help, which could be seen as dismissive and unappreciative. Even if he didn't agree with the method, being uninvolved in the process during such a messy situation might come off as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend made a comment about needing shorts. That seems like a trivial complaint compared to the effort the dad put in. The boyfriend's attitude might be disrespectful, especially since the dad was helping out of kindness. The author is right to be upset because showing gratitude is a basic social expectation. The boyfriend's justification that it wasn't urgent might be his way to avoid responsibility, but when a family member is helping with a problem, that's when support is most needed.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have known the dad was coming. If the author asked for permission to call her dad, and he agreed, maybe the boyfriend didn't think he had to help or engage. However, even if he wasn't directly involved, being respectful and at least acknowledging the help is important. Lying down while someone else does the work, especially under stressful conditions, is probably not the best approach.\n\nSo putting it all together, the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate and ungrateful. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting some level of respect and assistance, especially from her partner in such a challenging situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
