I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was uncooperative when the author's dad came to fix it. The boyfriend ended up lying down while the dad worked, and later got upset about needing to take a shower. He claims he didn't do anything because he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it and that he shouldn't have to help if things went wrong.\n\nSo, the author is upset that the boyfriend wasn't helpful or respectful, while the boyfriend thinks it's not a big deal. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's dad helped fix a toilet that was causing major issues in their home. The boyfriend didn't contribute and even showed disinterest and lack of respect by lying down. That seems like a problem. The author expected gratitude and help from her boyfriend during the process, which seems reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method. But even if he didn't agree, showing respect and helping clean up or being present would be expected. Lying down while someone else is working on a messy job might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, he told the author he wouldn't help if things went wrong, which is a red flag for not supporting her. \n\nThe dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't do anything. The author is frustrated because she expected basic courtesy and help. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive. \n\nIn terms of who's right, the boyfriend's behavior seems to lack support and respect. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking help and expecting her partner to be cooperative. The boyfriend's reasoning doesn't justify his inaction or disrespect. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. Maybe the boyfriend was stressed, but even so, being unhelpful and disrespectful is not acceptable. The key points are the lack of support and respect towards the author's dad and the author's expectations. The author's expectations are reasonable in a relationship where you support each other. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
