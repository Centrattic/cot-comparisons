I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a toilet clog and how the boyfriend handled it while the author's dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the events. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it, then bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more. They couldn't fix it, so the author asked to call her dad. The boyfriend agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When the dad came, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the 3-hour fix. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't assist, and now the dad is upset, and the couple is arguing.\n\nThe author thinks the boyfriend should have helped, but he claims he did nothing wrong. The author is upset because she expected common courtesy. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help, it wasn't urgent, and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nSo, who's right? Let's break it down. The boyfriend didn't help when a family member came to fix their home issue. Normally, when someone comes to help, especially in a messy situation like a toilet blockage, it's customary to assist. The boyfriend was uncooperative, which might have been rude. The author's dad was doing the dirty work, and the boyfriend didn't offer help. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were in a small apartment and the problem was urgent.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he didn't see it as urgent and disagreed with the method. But even if he disagreed, being present and unhelpful during a 3-hour fix without contributing could be seen as a lack of support. The author's dad was doing the work, and the boyfriend's attitude might have contributed to the dad's anger. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong here. She asked for help because they couldn't fix it themselves, and her dad came to assist. The boyfriend's refusal to help or support during the process could be the issue. However, maybe the boyfriend was stressed or had a different opinion on how to handle it. But usually, common courtesy would dictate helping when someone else is doing the laborious task.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
