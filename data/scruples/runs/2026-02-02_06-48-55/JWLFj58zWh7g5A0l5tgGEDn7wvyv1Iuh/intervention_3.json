I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend wasn't helping much and was lying down while the author's dad came to fix it. The author is upset because the boyfriend didn't contribute and was ungrateful. The boyfriend thinks he did nothing wrong.\n\nFirst, the toilet was a big problem because it's their only bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more. When they asked for the dad's help, the boyfriend was lying down during the process. The dad ended up doing all the work, which was quite messy, and the boyfriend was uncooperative, even getting upset when the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and that he disagreed with how the dad fixed it.\n\nNow, considering basic courtesy and partnership. In a relationship, especially when living together, supporting each other during crises is expected. The boyfriend didn't contribute meaningfully. After the dad fixed the toilet, the boyfriend's attitude was dismissive. Even if he didn't agree with the method, he should have been polite. Not helping and being ungrateful is inconsiderate. The author's dad did a favor, and the boyfriend's reaction made him angry. So, the boyfriend's behavior seems wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting help and gratitude. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
