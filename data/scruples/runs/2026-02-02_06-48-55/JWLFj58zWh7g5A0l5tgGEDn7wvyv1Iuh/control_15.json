I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend didn't help much when they first tried to fix it, and when the author's dad came over to help, the boyfriend was just lying down and didn't assist. Then he got annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her boyfriend tried to unclog the toilet themselves but failed. The boyfriend was frustrated during the purchase of the tool. Then he tried for an hour, she tried for two hours, but he kept urging her to give up. When her dad came to help, the boyfriend didn't participate and was uncooperative, leading to the dad being upset and the boyfriend's dismissive attitude.\n\nThe author is upset because she expected her boyfriend to be more helpful and show gratitude towards her dad. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thinks he did nothing wrong, that it wasn't urgent enough to bother the dad, and that he didn't help because he disagreed with the dad's method. \n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations in such situations. When someone comes to help with a problem, especially a messy one like a clogged toilet, it's generally expected that the host (the couple) would offer assistance. The boyfriend's inaction might be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful, especially since it's a task that requires physical effort and the dad was handling the dirty work. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he's not obligated to help because he disagrees with the method is a bit weak. Disagreement doesn't negate the need for basic courtesy and participation. Plus, the situation was urgent because they didn't have another bathroom. The boyfriend's refusal to help even in a supportive role (like cleaning up, holding tools, etc.) seems inconsiderate.\n\nThe dad's anger is a reaction to being treated without respect. It's reasonable for the author to feel that her boyfriend was in the wrong here. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude towards the problem's urgency and the dad's efforts are key issues here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inappropriate given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
