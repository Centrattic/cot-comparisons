I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and then being ungrateful when her dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who did what. The problem started when the toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, and the author tried for two more hours without success. Then the author asked her dad to help, which the boyfriend agreed to, but he didn't help. Instead, he lay down while the author and her dad worked. After it was fixed, the dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't contribute, and the boyfriend argued that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it, saying it wasn't urgent and he didn't agree with the method her dad used. Now, the author is upset, the dad is angry, and the boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is about responsibility and gratitude. Did the boyfriend have a duty to help fix the toilet, and was it wrong of him to not contribute and act ungrateful? \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when a partner is in a situation where they need to fix a problem (like a broken toilet), especially in a small apartment with no alternative bathroom, it's expected that both parties would work together. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then stopped and let the author handle it, even when she was struggling. Then he didn't help when her dad came over, even though the situation was messy and time-consuming. Instead of participating, he lay down. That seems dismissive. \n\nIn terms of gratitude, the boyfriend's attitude that he shouldn't have to help because he didn't agree with the dad's method is a bit strange. Even if you disagree, the main goal is solving the problem. Not helping and being ungrateful is a big red flag. The dad was helping out of the goodness of his heart, and the boyfriend's response was to not assist and then question the author's expectations. \n\nThe author's expectations are reasonable. In a partnership, especially after four years and living together, mutual support is expected. The boyfriend's lack of contribution and his attitude towards the author's dad is inconsiderate. The dad being angry makes sense because he put in three hours of hard, dirty work without any help, and the boyfriend didn't even acknowledge the effort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it is flawed. Allowing someone to fix the toilet isn't a favor; the dad was helping out of necessity, not because he was doing a favor to the boyfriend. The boyfriend should have been appreciative of the help and involved himself in the process. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and ungrateful. The author is not in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to help in a shared living situation and for her dad's help to be appreciated. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
