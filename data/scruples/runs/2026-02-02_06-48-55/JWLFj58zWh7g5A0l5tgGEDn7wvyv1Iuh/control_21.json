I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend didn't help when the toilet was clogged, and instead of helping, he just laid down while the author and her dad dealt with it. The boyfriend later got upset when the dad had to take a shower and needed clean clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was a major problem, clogged for a couple of days. They tried to fix it themselves, but it took a long time. The author's dad came over, and during the whole time the boyfriend was laying down. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't contribute. Afterward, the boyfriend seemed to be annoyed that the dad needed clean clothes, which upset the dad.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he didn't do anything because he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, and he thought it wasn't that urgent. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed gratitude towards her dad.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider what's expected in a relationship. When someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation like dealing with a clogged toilet, it's customary to be grateful and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't help at all during the process. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least been respectful or offered to help in another way. Laying down and doing nothing while the author and her dad were working seems inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction to the dad needing clean clothes seems like he's shifting blame. If the dad had to take a shower because he was covered in waste, that's a natural consequence of the job. The boyfriend's attitude here is ungrateful and possibly dismissive of the effort the dad put in.\n\nThe author's perspective is that her boyfriend should have shown basic courtesy and help. The boyfriend's reasoning seems to minimize the problem and not take responsibility. In a four-year relationship, especially living together, one would expect mutual support in household issues. The boyfriend's inaction and his comments afterward likely hurt the author and her dad, leading to the dad's anger and the author's distress.\n\nSo, the author is probably not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author is justified in feeling upset. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
