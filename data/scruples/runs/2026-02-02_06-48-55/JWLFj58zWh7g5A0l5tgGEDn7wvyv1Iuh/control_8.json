I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a clogged toilet that the boyfriend and author tried to fix for two days. They bought an auger, he tried for an hour, she tried for two hours, but it didn't work. Then she asked her dad to come help, which he did, but the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad was upset because the BF didn't help, and the BF thinks he's not in the wrong. The author is upset and wants to know if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's look at the BF's actions. He tried for an hour, then she tried for two. Then when her dad came over, he didn't help at all, just laid down. The BF's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, so he's being helpful. But the author and her dad feel he should have been more helpful and courteous.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations in relationships and basic politeness. When someone comes to help, especially a family member, the usual social norm is to at least be present, offer assistance, and show appreciation. The BF's behavior of lying down while the dad is dealing with the mess is seen as disrespectful and unhelpful. The dad's reaction is understandable because he's doing the work, and the BF isn't contributing. \n\nThe BF's argument that it wasn't urgent is questionable because they had a non-working toilet for days, which is a significant issue. Also, his claim that he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it isn't mentioned before, so it seems like an after-the-fact excuse. The BF's lack of action and attitude likely hurt the author's feelings and strained the relationship with her dad.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask her BF if she could call her dad, and he agreed. However, his behavior during the actual help was poor. The author isn't at fault for seeking help when her BF wasn't able to fix it. Her expectation of basic courtesy from her BF is reasonable. \n\nSo, putting this together, the BF's actions are inconsiderate, and the author isn't wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
