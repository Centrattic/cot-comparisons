I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and then being unhelpful when her dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, the toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it, then the boyfriend tried for an hour, and she tried for two more hours. They bought tools, but it wasn't working. Then she asked her dad to help, which the boyfriend agreed to but didn't assist. The dad fixed it in three hours while the boyfriend was just lying down. The dad got angry because the BF didn't help, and the BF argues that it wasn't urgent enough to bother his dad and that he didn't agree with the method. The author is upset because she expected gratitude, but the BF doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are about responsibility in a shared living situation and social etiquette. When someone comes into your home to do a favor, especially a physically demanding and unpleasant one like fixing a clogged toilet, the expectation is that the hosts (the couple) should be involved and helpful. The boyfriend's inaction could be seen as disrespectful towards the father's effort. The dad worked hard, got dirty, and had to ask for clean clothes, which the BF dismissed. That's a social faux pas. \n\nOn the other hand, the BF might feel that since the author was the one who asked her dad to come, and he didn't want to help, he had the right to disengage. But that seems like a selfish take. In a relationship where you live together, shared responsibilities are expected. Also, when someone else is helping, contributing is polite. The BF's attitude of not helping and being dismissive is likely the main issue here.\n\nThe author's dad was angry because he felt unappreciated. The BF's reasoning to not help and disagree with the method is a bit weak. Disagreeing with the method doesn't justify not helping, especially when the problem is affecting their shared living space. The BF could have at least assisted in cleaning up or offered to help in another way. His lack of effort and disrespectful attitude towards the father's help is where the fault lies. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the BF is.\n"
