I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was supposed to help but ended up lying down while the author's dad fixed it. The boyfriend is defensive, saying he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged for a couple of days, they bought tools, the boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. When they called the author's dad, the boyfriend just lay down and didn't help. The dad was upset because he had to do all the work, and the boyfriend was dismissive, even criticizing the dad's method. \n\nThe author feels the boyfriend should be grateful, but he's not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: he tried for an hour, but that's not enough considering the urgency. The toilet was unusable, and they had no other bathroom. The boyfriend was annoyed from the start, didn't help during the dad's visit, and was uncooperative. His reasoning that it wasn't urgent and he didn't have to help doesn't hold up when they were in a dire situation. \n\nThe author's dad did the work, got dirty, and the boyfriend's lack of gratitude and help seems inconsiderate. The author is upset because they expected support from their partner. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. The boyfriend's behavior comes off as lazy and disrespectful, especially towards the author's dad. The author isn't wrong for expecting basic courtesy and help from her partner during a tough situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions and attitude are the main issues here.\n"
