I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a couple of days. The author tried to fix it, then bought an auger with her boyfriend. He tried for an hour, she tried for two more. Then she asked her dad to help. The boyfriend agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When her dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down, didn't help, and even got upset when her dad asked for shorts. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and effort. The boyfriend didn't contribute after his initial attempt, even though the problem was urgent. The apartment is small, so the smell and mess were affecting their quality of life. The dad helped them, but the boyfriend was uncooperative and ungrateful. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't need to help and thought it wasn't a big deal. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. If one partner is putting in effort and the other isn't, especially in a crisis, that can be a problem. The boyfriend's lack of action and the way he treated the author's dad seems dismissive. The author expected gratitude and help, which is reasonable. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend was frustrated and just wanted to relax, but when a family member is helping, especially in a messy situation, expecting some level of respect and assistance is fair. The boyfriend's attitude might be selfish. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. The author isn't at fault for expecting her partner to be helpful and respectful towards her father, especially when the situation was causing them distress. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
