I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation: The author's boyfriend had a clogged toilet. They tried to fix it themselves, bought tools, but the boyfriend tried for an hour and then the author tried for two more hours. Then they called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down when the dad arrived and didn't help. The dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't assist, and the boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and that he didn't agree with how the dad was doing it. The author is upset because she expected gratitude and help from her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's side: he might have felt that since he had already tried and failed, and maybe didn't know how to help, or he didn't want to interfere with how the dad was doing it. He might have thought that his role was to let the dad handle it. On the other hand, the author and her dad expected him to contribute, at least by helping or showing some gratitude.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone comes to help you, it's customary to be grateful and offer some assistance, especially if you're the one who arranged the help. The boyfriend's laying down and not helping could be seen as disrespectful towards the dad's effort. But maybe there's a cultural or personal difference in how people perceive these situations. The boyfriend might not have realized the social expectations here. However, the dad did end up doing all the work, which is a lot, so expecting some help or at least being polite makes sense.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he didn't have to help is weak. Even if he didn't know how, simply being present and offering to assist is usually expected. Also, the fact that he was annoyed earlier about the situation might have contributed to his attitude. The dad being angry is understandable because he's doing a favor but is met with indifference or even resistance.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong here. She's upset because her boyfriend didn't act appropriately. The boyfriend's behavior was disrespectful and unhelpful. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
