I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario involves a toilet clog that they couldn't fix, so they called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, and he didn't help. The dad got upset, and now the boyfriend is defending himself.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are: the boyfriend didn't help during the process, was annoyed when they went to buy the tool, and then just laid down while the author's dad was fixing it. The author felt their dad wasn't treated with respect and that the boyfriend should have contributed more.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he allowed the dad to help, which he took as a favor. But the author and her dad expected more active participation and courtesy from the boyfriend. In most cultures, when someone comes to help, even if it's a family member, it's expected that the person whose home it is should offer some assistance, maybe even just being present in a respectful manner. Lying down while a guest is dealing with a messy, unpleasant task like unclogging a toilet might be seen as inconsiderate or ungrateful.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's attitude of \"I didn't do anything wrong\" when he didn't help and was dismissive of the problem's urgency could be a red flag. The author is confused about his lack of common courtesy. The boyfriend's claim that it wasn't urgent might be disputable since they had a non-working toilet for two days, which is a basic necessity. If he disagreed with the dad's method, he could have expressed that in a respectful way but still offered to help instead of just lying down.\n\nSo, the author didn't do anything wrong by asking for help when it was clear the boyfriend wasn't able to fix it. The boyfriend's actions (not helping, being uncooperative) likely caused the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
