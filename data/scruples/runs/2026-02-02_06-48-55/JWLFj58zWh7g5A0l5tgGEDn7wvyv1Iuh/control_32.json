I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a clogged toilet and the boyfriend's behavior during the cleanup. Let's start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the problem started when the boyfriend had stomach issues, leading to a clogged toilet. The author tried to fix it without success. They bought an auger, and the boyfriend tried for an hour while the author helped. Then the author tried for two more hours, but the boyfriend kept telling her to give up. Finally, the author called her dad, who comes over and fixes it while the boyfriend is lying down, not helping. The dad ends up with dirty clothes and asks for clean shorts, which the boyfriend is upset about. The dad is angry because the boyfriend didn't help, and the author agrees. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he just let the dad fix it and that he didn't think it was urgent. He also says he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it, so he did nothing. The author feels that the boyfriend should have shown more gratitude and help, but he thinks she's wrong to expect that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's look at both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: The toilet was a big problem since it clogged completely, they have a small apartment with no other bathroom. The boyfriend didn't help when he tried, then later when the dad came, he just laid down and didn't assist. The author feels disrespected that he didn't help during the cleanup and wasn't grateful. The dad was upset, and the author is upset too. She's asking if she's wrong to expect basic courtesy and help from her boyfriend in this situation.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: He tried to unclog it for an hour. Then he thought the author should give up. He allowed her dad to help, so he's not doing anything wrong. He didn't think it was urgent enough to warrant all the effort. Also, he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it, so he didn't help. He thinks the author is being unreasonable in her expectations.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations in relationships. Typically, when someone helps out with a problem, especially something as unpleasant as a clogged toilet, there's an expectation of gratitude. Even if you disagree with the method, being unhelpful and ungrateful is generally frowned upon. The boyfriend's lack of action when the dad was working\u2014especially after he had already given up trying himself\u2014seems inconsiderate. The dad is a guest helping out, and not showing respect to him would be a problem.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's refusal to help when the situation was clearly dire (no working toilet, a small apartment) shows a lack of cooperation. The author was trying to fix it for hours before calling her dad, which implies that it was urgent. The boyfriend's attitude that it wasn't a big deal and that he could just do nothing might be a red flag in terms of responsibility and teamwork in a partnership.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to help because he didn't agree with the dad's method is weak. Even if you disagree, common courtesy would suggest assisting in some way or at least showing respect to the person helping. Lying down and doing nothing while someone else is working hard in such a messy situation is not typical behavior expected in a relationship.\n\nMoreover, the dad was so upset that he doesn't want to speak to the boyfriend anymore, which indicates that the boyfriend's actions were perceived as extremely disrespectful. The author's frustration is valid because she expected her partner to support her and help during a crisis, not just lay down and do nothing. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, when a partner is in a difficult situation, especially one that requires physical effort and dealing with something unpleasant, the expectation is mutual support. The boyfriend's lack of support here could be seen as a breach of that mutual responsibility. The author is not unreasonable for expecting her partner to be helpful and grateful in such circumstances. Therefore, it's more likely the boyfriend is in the wrong, making the author not at fault.\n"
