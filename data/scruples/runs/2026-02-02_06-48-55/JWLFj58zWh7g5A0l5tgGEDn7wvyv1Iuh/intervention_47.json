I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog and his reaction to the author's father helping fix it.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was already involved in trying to unclog the toilet. He tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. So he wasn't completely inactive, but maybe not as helpful as he could have been. Then, when the author's dad came over, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't help. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't contribute, and the author is conflicted about whether the boyfriend is wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he allowed the dad to help, and he didn't think it was urgent. He also said he didn't like how the dad was fixing it. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more grateful and helpful.\n\nSo, considering common courtesy, when someone comes to your home to help with a messy situation, especially involving sewage, it's customary to be helpful and at least show appreciation. The boyfriend didn't contribute physically, didn't assist during the dad's work, and made comments about the dad's approach. That seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting gratitude and help from her boyfriend. It's normal to want your partner to support you and show respect towards your family. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not helping, even if he had his opinions, was probably inconsiderate. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the situation, the boyfriend's actions seem disrespectful. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
