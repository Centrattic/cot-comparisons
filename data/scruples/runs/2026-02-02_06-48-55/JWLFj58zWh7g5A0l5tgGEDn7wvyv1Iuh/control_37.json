I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and their dad came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, and he didn't assist. The author is upset because she expects him to be grateful and helpful, but the boyfriend claims it's not a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The toilet was clogged, they tried multiple times, and finally, the author's dad had to come over. The boyfriend didn't help, was uncooperative, and even dismissed the urgency. The dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't contribute. The key points are: the boyfriend's lack of effort, his dismissiveness, and the expectation of gratitude.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. From the description, the boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. When someone helps you, especially in a messy situation, it's normal to expect some level of cooperation or gratitude. The boyfriend's argument that he was doing nothing because he disagreed with the method might be flimsy. Disagreement doesn't excuse not helping, especially when it's a shared living situation. \n\nThe author's dad was doing the work while the boyfriend was just lying down. That's a valid reason for the dad's anger. The boyfriend's response that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it is also questionable. Allowing someone to do the work doesn't mean you're contributing. The boyfriend's lack of action in a joint problem (their apartment) shows a lack of consideration.\n\nConsidering societal norms, in a partnership, both people should contribute to solving household issues. The boyfriend's inaction here is a problem. The author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to assist or at least show appreciation. Her dad's reaction is understandable given the disrespect shown. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author is justified in her expectations. The boyfriend's lack of help and dismissive attitude make him the one at fault here.\n"
