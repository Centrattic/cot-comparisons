I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about her boyfriend not helping while her dad fixed a clogged toilet and instead just lying down. The author is upset because her boyfriend didn't contribute and acted ungrateful. She's asking if she's the asshole here (AITA).\n\nFirst, let me break down the events. The toilet clogged after her boyfriend had stomach issues. They tried various methods to unclog it over two days without success. Then her dad came over. The author mentions that her boyfriend was lying down while her dad and she were working on it. After the dad fixed it, her dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't help and was uncooperative. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't help because he disagreed with her dad's method and thought it wasn't urgent enough. He also thought he was being helpful by allowing her dad to fix it.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for another opinion. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: When a family member comes over to help with a significant problem (a clogged toilet, which is a hygiene issue), the boyfriend's lack of assistance and being uncooperative is seen as inconsiderate. The author and her dad were actively working, and the boyfriend's passive role could be seen as disrespectful to the helper (the dad) and not contributing as a partner. The dad was upset, which caused tension. The author feels that her boyfriend should have shown gratitude and helped.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: He allowed her to call her dad, so he's enabling the solution. He might not have helped because he disagreed with the method or felt it wasn't urgent. He could be feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with the situation. He might not see his inaction as a problem since he didn't prevent the solution from happening.\n\nBut in most social norms, when someone comes to help, especially a guest, the host (the couple) should show appreciation and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't help, which could be seen as rude. Also, considering the toilet was in a small apartment next to their bed, the situation was urgent and unpleasant. The boyfriend's refusal to help or even participate might be unreasonable. His argument that he disagreed with the method doesn't justify not offering help at all. Disagreeing with the method could be discussed, but in an urgent situation, cooperation is usually expected.\n\nThe author's dad was working in a messy situation, and the boyfriend not helping might have made him feel unwelcome or unappreciated. The author's expectations of gratitude and assistance are reasonable. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being dismissive is problematic. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and she and her dad are justified in being upset. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
