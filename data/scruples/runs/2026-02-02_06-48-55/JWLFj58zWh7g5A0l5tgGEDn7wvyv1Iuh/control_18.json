I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and then acted ungrateful when the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged, the boyfriend tried for an hour but gave up, then the author tried for two hours. When the author's dad came over to help, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad fixed it, and the boyfriend didn't assist. The dad was upset, and the boyfriend seems ungrateful, even making excuses about not helping because he didn't like how the dad was doing it.\n\nSo, the author is upset because she expected her boyfriend to be more helpful and show gratitude towards her dad. The boyfriend thinks it's not a big deal and that he's right for not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at social norms, when someone comes to your home to help with a messy situation (like a clogged toilet), especially involving waste, the expectation is to be at least minimally helpful. Lying down and doing nothing might be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful, especially when others are working hard to fix the problem. The boyfriend's excuse about disagreeing with the method doesn't really justify not helping at all, especially since the author's dad was the one who ended up doing all the work.\n\nThe boyfriend's response to the dad's request for clean clothes also seems dismissive. Even if he didn't like the method, he could have shown some gratitude for the help. The dad worked for three hours and was left cleaning up, which is a lot of effort. The boyfriend's attitude here might be seen as lacking empathy and common courtesy.\n\nThe author isn't asking for the boyfriend to fix it alone; she called her dad because the boyfriend hadn't succeeded. The fact that the boyfriend didn't contribute during the dad's visit is a problem. The dad being angry makes sense because he was helping in a difficult situation and wasn't met with cooperation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it seems off. Allowing someone to help isn't a favor that requires gratitude; the dad's effort and work should be appreciated. The boyfriend's lack of assistance doesn't reflect poorly on the author's actions but rather on his own behavior.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are important. The boyfriend's actions here could be seen as dismissive towards both the author's efforts and her dad's help. The author's expectations for gratitude and help are reasonable in this context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
