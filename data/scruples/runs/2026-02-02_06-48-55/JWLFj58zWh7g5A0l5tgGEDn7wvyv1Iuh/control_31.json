I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend not helping when her dad came to fix the clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, the couple tried to unclog the toilet themselves. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then she tried for two more. When her dad arrived to help, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist. Her dad ended up doing all the work, which was quite involved and messy. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't help, and now her dad is angry and won't talk to him.\n\nThe boyfriend's main points: He claims he's not in the wrong, says she should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it. He argues it wasn't urgent and he disagreed with how her dad was fixing it. He thinks he did the best by doing nothing.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the boyfriend's behavior was appropriate. When someone comes to help fix a problem, especially one that's causing discomfort (like a clogged toilet in a small apartment with no other bathroom), it's expected that the host (the couple) would assist. The boyfriend didn't contribute, didn't show gratitude, and even criticized the method, which could be seen as uncooperative.\n\nThe author feels that basic courtesy would require her boyfriend to help or at least be polite. Her dad's reaction supports that. The boyfriend's defense seems dismissive and lacking in empathy. He didn't take responsibility for the situation, which led to a significant problem that required professional help. \n\nConsidering social norms, when someone does a favor, the host should show appreciation. The boyfriend's lack of help and disrespectful attitude (lying down, not assisting) likely crossed a line. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting respect and assistance from her partner during a crisis. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and ungrateful.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
