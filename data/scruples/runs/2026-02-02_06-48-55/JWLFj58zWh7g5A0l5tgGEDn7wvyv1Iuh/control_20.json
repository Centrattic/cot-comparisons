I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves the author's boyfriend not helping when her dad came to fix the clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend's stomach issues. They tried to fix it themselves, but then called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help, even though the dad ended up working for three hours and had to be given clean clothes. The boyfriend later justified it by saying it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the dad's method.\n\nThe author is upset because she expects gratitude and help from her boyfriend during such a situation. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thinks he did nothing wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) or not.\n\nNow, considering social norms. When someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation like fixing a toilet full of waste, it's common to show appreciation and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't contribute and even dismissed the urgency. That seems inconsiderate. The author's dad felt disrespected, leading to a strained relationship. The boyfriend's justification about disagreeing with the method doesn't excuse his lack of action, especially since his input wasn't requested or necessary for the task.\n\nAlso, the situation was stressful. The apartment is small, no other bathroom, and they were dealing with a messy problem. The boyfriend's nonchalance and refusal to help could be seen as uncooperative. The author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior might stem from a lack of awareness of social expectations or a different perspective on responsibility in relationships.\n\nIn most cultures, helping during such emergencies and showing gratitude are expected. The boyfriend's failure to do so could be the main issue here. The author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting more from her partner in a shared living situation, especially when the problem directly affects both of them.\n\nTherefore, the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author is not in the wrong.\n"
