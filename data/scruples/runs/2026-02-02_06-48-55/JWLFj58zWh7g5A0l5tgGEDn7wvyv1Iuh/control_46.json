I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and then acting ungrateful when her dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario step by step. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. Eventually, they called the author's dad. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it in three hours, and the boyfriend didn't contribute, leading to the dad being upset. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't need to help, thought it wasn't urgent, and disagreed with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the key points here.\n\nThe main issue seems to be the boyfriend's lack of participation and respect towards the author's dad. The author's dad did a favor by fixing the toilet, which was quite a task. The boyfriend didn't help, which could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the dad was upset because of this. The boyfriend claims he's not wrong, saying the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to help. But the author feels that basic courtesy is expected.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when someone does a favor, especially a family member, the partner should at least show gratitude and support. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not helping could be seen as dismissive and unhelpful. Additionally, if he disagreed with the method, maybe he should have communicated that respectfully instead of just ignoring the situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend was already trying to fix it earlier and perhaps felt it wasn't his responsibility anymore. But given that the problem was severe and in a small apartment, it's reasonable to expect some level of cooperation. Also, the dad's effort and the mess involved would usually warrant appreciation, not indifference.\n\nLooking at common courtesies, when a guest (in this case, the author's dad) is helping, the host (the boyfriend) should at least assist or show respect. Lying down while someone else works hard, especially in a messy situation, is probably not acceptable. The boyfriend's response of not helping and not expressing gratitude is likely the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and lack of respect are the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
