I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The author's boyfriend was uncooperative and even laid down while her dad was fixing it. The boyfriend claims he's not at fault, while the author thinks he is.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged, which is a big problem, especially in a small apartment without another bathroom. They tried themselves for hours without success. Then the author asked for her dad's help. The boyfriend agreed but didn't help during the process. Instead, he just lay down the whole time. The dad fixed it in three hours, and the boyfriend even got upset when the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let her dad fix it, and he didn't think it was urgent. He also said he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, so he didn't help. The author is upset because she thinks he should have been more helpful and courteous.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility and respect. In a situation where a family member is coming to fix a problem, especially something as unpleasant as a toilet clog, the boyfriend's lack of participation and his attitude could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he didn't agree with the method, not helping at all seems like avoiding responsibility. Especially considering the mess and the effort the dad put in, not showing gratitude or at least some participation is a problem.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the dad needing clean clothes also seems unreasonable. It's expected to be considerate towards someone who's helping you in such a situation. The author's dad was upset, which makes sense, and the boyfriend's refusal to help or show proper courtesy is likely why he's upset.\n\nThe author's expectations aren't unreasonable. Most people would expect some level of cooperation and gratitude when someone helps them, especially in a difficult situation. The boyfriend's behavior here doesn't align with common social expectations, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
