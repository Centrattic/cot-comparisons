I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a clogged toilet that the boyfriend and author tried to fix. The boyfriend ended up lying down while the author's dad came to help, and the boyfriend was uncooperative and ungrateful. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend didn't help during the repair. He was lying down, which seems passive and unhelpful. The author's dad did all the work, which is a big favor, and the boyfriend wasn't appreciative. The boyfriend's reasoning was that he didn't have to help and even disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. That sounds dismissive and ungracious.\n\nThe author is upset because they expected gratitude and some level of participation from their boyfriend. The boyfriend's attitude might be seen as disrespectful towards the author's dad, who went through the trouble of helping. The key points here are about mutual respect, shared responsibility in a relationship, and social etiquette when someone is doing a favor.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems to lack both active participation and gratitude. In a partnership, especially when living together, it's reasonable to expect both parties to contribute to problem-solving. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his dismissive attitude could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's frustration is justified because their dad did the work alone, and the boyfriend's response was negative.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and attitude were the issues. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
