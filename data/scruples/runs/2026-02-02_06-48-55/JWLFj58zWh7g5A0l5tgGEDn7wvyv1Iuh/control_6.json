I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong regarding their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend was passive while the author and her father tried to fix the toilet. He didn't contribute, laid down, and even seemed annoyed when they tried to get help. The father ended up doing all the work, which he was upset about, and the boyfriend's attitude was dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility in a partnership and basic courtesy. When a problem arises that affects shared living space, both partners should contribute to solving it. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then urged the author to give up, which isn't helpful. When the author's father came over, the boyfriend didn't help, just laid down, which is disrespectful to the person offering assistance.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he should be thanked for allowing the father to help seems misplaced. Letting someone help isn't the same as being grateful or contributing. The author's expectation that her boyfriend would help or at least show respect is reasonable. The father's anger is understandable given the situation.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support and respect are important. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude towards the problem's urgency and the effort of others (both the author and her father) indicates a lack of consideration. The author isn't being delusional for expecting common courtesy; it's a standard social norm.\n\nTherefore, the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's expectations. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
