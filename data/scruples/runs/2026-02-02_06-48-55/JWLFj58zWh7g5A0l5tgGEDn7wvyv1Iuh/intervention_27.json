I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet clogged, even when her father came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the father worked, and he didn't want to help. The author and her dad had to handle it, and now the dad is upset with the boyfriend.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about responsibility and basic courtesy. The boyfriend didn't help in any way, even though the problem was urgent\u2014no other bathroom, the toilet was a mess. He just lay around and was annoyed. The author tried her best and even involved her dad when she couldn't fix it. The dad then had to do the work, and the boyfriend didn't even assist. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he's not obligated to help and that he disagreed with how the dad fixed it. But that's not a good excuse for being unhelpful and ungrateful towards the father-in-law.\n\nThe author expects her boyfriend to at least show some basic respect or assistance when a family member is doing a favor. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive and uncooperative. So, in terms of responsibility, the boyfriend didn't contribute and even made the situation worse by not showing up when the dad was there. The author was trying her best, then her dad helped, but the boyfriend didn't help at all. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the boyfriend's lack of action and disrespect towards the father, maybe it's the other way around. The boyfriend's behavior seems ungrateful and inconsiderate. The author isn't at fault for wanting help and then expecting some level of support from her partner. The boyfriend's claim that it wasn't urgent doesn't hold up because they couldn't use the toilet, which is a basic need. \n\nSo, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who didn't help and acted rudely. Therefore, the correct choice is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
