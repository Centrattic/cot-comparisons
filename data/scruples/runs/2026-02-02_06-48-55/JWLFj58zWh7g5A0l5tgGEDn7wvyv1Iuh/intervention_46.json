I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend was uncooperative when their toilet clogged. They tried to fix it themselves, bought tools, and when they called the author's dad for help, the boyfriend was just lying down doing nothing. The dad fixed it, and the boyfriend was upset about needing to borrow shorts and didn't help. Now the dad is angry, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more. But then when the dad came, the boyfriend was lying down. The boyfriend didn't help at all. The author's dad ended up doing all the work, which was quite involved and messy. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it and thought it wasn't urgent. He also said he didn't agree with how the dad was doing it, but he didn't help anyway. The author feels that the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed gratitude, but the boyfriend thinks he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the boyfriend have a responsibility to help? Should he have been more involved when the problem was urgent? The author's dad was doing all the work while the boyfriend was passive. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive. Even if he disagreed with the method, staying uninvolved when the problem was so severe (no bathroom, pool of shit) seems unhelpful. Gratitude for the dad's help is expected, but the boyfriend didn't contribute, which might have caused the dad's anger. \n\nThe author might have expected the boyfriend to assist, but maybe the boyfriend thought he was doing enough by letting the dad come. But in a situation where the problem was causing inconvenience, being passive could be seen as not pulling one's weight. The boyfriend's reasoning doesn't seem to consider the effort and discomfort the dad went through. So, the boyfriend's behavior might be inconsiderate, and the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Therefore, the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong).\n"
