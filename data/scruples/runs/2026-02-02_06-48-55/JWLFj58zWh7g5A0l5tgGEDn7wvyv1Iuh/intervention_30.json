I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and instead lay down while the author and her dad tried to fix it. The boyfriend later complained about the dad coming unprepared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side is that the boyfriend didn't help, didn't show gratitude to her dad, and was dismissive. The boyfriend claims he didn't do anything wrong, that he let her dad help, and that he had his own reasons for not helping. \n\nThe key points here are about responsibility in a relationship and basic courtesy. When a partner is in a situation where a problem needs to be solved, especially one that's urgent (like a clogged toilet in a small apartment with no other bathroom), contributing seems reasonable. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then urged the author to give up, which might be seen as not doing enough. Then, when the author's dad arrived, the boyfriend laid down and didn't assist, which could be seen as disrespectful or unhelpful. \n\nGratitude is another aspect. The dad helped out, got dirty, and the boyfriend complained about the shorts. That's probably a key point where the boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate. In most social norms, showing appreciation for someone helping you is expected, especially when they go above and beyond. The boyfriend's attitude here seems dismissive and ungrateful.\n\nThe author might feel that her boyfriend should have helped more and shown more respect. The boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to do anything is questionable. In a shared living situation, contributing to solving household problems is usually expected. Also, if he disagreed with the method her dad used, that's a different matter, but not helping at all isn't acceptable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but now seems unsure. But based on the details, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the main issue. He didn't contribute adequately, didn't support his partner during the problem, and was ungrateful towards her dad. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's actions were likely disrespectful and unhelpful. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
