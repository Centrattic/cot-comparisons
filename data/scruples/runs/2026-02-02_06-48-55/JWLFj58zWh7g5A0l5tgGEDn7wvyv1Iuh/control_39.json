I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog incident.\n\nFirst, the toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. The boyfriend was urging her to give up. They called the author's dad, who came over. During the time the dad was fixing the toilet, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad was upset about this, and the boyfriend's reasoning was that he let the dad fix it, it wasn't urgent, and he disagreed with the method. The author feels the boyfriend should have been more grateful and helpful.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility, effort, and respect towards the author's dad. The boyfriend didn't contribute during the problem-solving, which led to the dad being angry. The author is upset because she expected more from her partner.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he allowed the dad to help, but he didn't help himself. He claims it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the method. However, when a family member comes over to fix an urgent problem, it's generally considered polite to at least offer some help, not just lie around. The boyfriend didn't even try to assist, which might be seen as disrespectful or uncooperative. The author's dad was doing the work, which is a favor, so expecting gratitude and some level of participation is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's stance that he's not in the wrong might stem from a different perspective on what's expected in such situations. Maybe he values autonomy or has a different view on household responsibilities. However, the situation seems to be a crisis that required immediate attention, and not contributing could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The fact that the author's dad was so upset that he doesn't want to speak to the boyfriend anymore indicates that his actions were socially unacceptable from the dad's perspective.\n\nThe author, on the other hand, is seeking validation for her expectations of gratitude and cooperation. Her perspective is that when someone helps you, especially in a difficult, messy situation, you should be thankful and support them in any way. The boyfriend's lack of action and his dismissive attitude towards the urgency could be seen as the problem here.\n\nIn most cultural norms, showing respect and assistance when someone is helping you, especially a family member, is expected. The boyfriend's behavior, while perhaps not malicious, lacks the consideration and teamwork that one would expect in a partner during a crisis. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong, and the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. So, the answer is B.\n"
