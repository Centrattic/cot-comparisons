I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's boyfriend (BF) was unhelpful when their toilet clogged. The BF was lying down while the author and her dad worked on fixing it. The BF didn't offer help, was dismissive, and even criticized her dad's approach. The BF's reasoning is that it wasn't urgent and he didn't agree with her dad's method, so he chose to do nothing. The author feels this is uncourteous and that the BF should have helped or at least been respectful.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are about responsibility in a shared living situation, respect towards a guest (the author's dad), and the BF's attitude.\n\nThe BF didn't help unclogging the toilet, which is a shared problem when they live together. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have offered to help in another way. Lying down and doing nothing during a 3-hour process seems neglectful. Also, his attitude towards the author's dad\u2014being unhelpful and dismissive\u2014lacks basic courtesy. The BF's claim that it wasn't urgent is questionable, considering the toilet wasn't working for days and created a mess. \n\nThe author's expectations of common courtesy are reasonable. When someone helps out, even a non-relative, it's expected to be respectful. The BF's behavior might stem from a lack of consideration or different values, but that doesn't make him right. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's actions and attitude were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
