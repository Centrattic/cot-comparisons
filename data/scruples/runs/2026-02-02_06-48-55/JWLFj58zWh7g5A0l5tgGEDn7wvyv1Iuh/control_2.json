I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend and dad.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be that the boyfriend was passive while the author and her dad dealt with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend didn't help, even though the situation was urgent and they were in a small apartment with no other bathroom. He also laid down while the author's dad was working, which is seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he allowed the dad to fix it and didn't see it as a big deal. But the author and her dad expected him to be more helpful and show some gratitude. The dad was upset and now doesn't want to talk to him because he didn't contribute.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and respect. When someone is in your home helping with a problem, especially something as messy and urgent as a toilet clog, it's expected that everyone present would assist in some way. The boyfriend's inaction and lack of engagement could be seen as disrespectful, especially after the author had already tried for hours and was exhausted. Also, laying down during the process might come off as dismissive of the problem's severity.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a different perspective. Perhaps the boyfriend felt overwhelmed or didn't know how to help. But given the context of a clogged toilet that's critical for their living situation, it's hard to justify doing nothing. The author's dad was helping as a favor, which should require some level of appreciation and effort from the boyfriend, not just passive acceptance.\n\nCommon courtesy usually involves showing gratitude and contributing where possible. The boyfriend didn't do either, which likely hurt the author and her dad. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author is justified in feeling upset. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
