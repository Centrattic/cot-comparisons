I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation she described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the toilet clogged after her boyfriend had stomach issues. She tried to fix it, bought tools, and he tried for an hour while she tried for two more. Then she asked her dad to help because they were stuck in a small apartment with no other bathroom. Her boyfriend agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When her dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help, even though the situation was messy and unpleasant. The dad ended up doing all the work, and the boyfriend got upset when he had to give him shorts. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend claims he's not in the wrong.\n\nThe author is upset because she expected her boyfriend to help, be courteous, and not be passive during such a crisis. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he's not obligated to help his father-in-law and that the situation wasn't urgent. He also disagreed with how the dad was fixing it, which he used as a reason not to participate.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about responsibility, respect, and expectations in a relationship. When someone's family helps you, especially in a difficult situation, there's an expectation of gratitude and participation. The boyfriend didn't contribute, which the author and her dad found disrespectful. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive of the urgency and the effort the dad put in. \n\nCommon courtesy would suggest that even if he didn't agree with the method, he should have at least offered help or shown respect towards the person fixing the toilet. Lying down and doing nothing when the situation was so bad (a pool of feces nearby) seems inconsiderate. The dad's anger is understandable because he was doing a favor and wasn't treated with respect. The boyfriend's refusal to assist and his dismissive attitude likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe author's perspective is that her boyfriend is ungrateful and inconsiderate, while he thinks he's not at fault. The question is whether her expectations are unreasonable. From a typical social standpoint, when someone helps you in a difficult situation, expecting some level of cooperation or at least respect is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior doesn't meet that standard, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the boyfriend isn't obligated to help, but the way he handled it was poor. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, and she's the one seeking validation, the answer likely is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
