I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend was uncooperative when the author called her dad to fix it, and he ended up doing nothing while her dad worked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The toilet was clogged, which is a significant problem, especially in a small apartment without another bathroom. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two hours, but it didn't work. Then she asked her dad to help, which he did. The boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist, and even had an issue with the dad needing to borrow shorts. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't help, and the author is upset too. The boyfriend argues that he didn't do anything wrong, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. The question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone helps a friend or family member, it's customary to show gratitude and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't contribute and even seemed uncooperative. The author called her dad for help, which was necessary given the situation. The boyfriend's lack of help and his dismissive attitude could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's dad worked for three hours and had to clean up, which is a big ask. The boyfriend's response of not helping and being annoyed at the dad's request for shorts is problematic. The author's frustration is justified because she was in a difficult situation and her partner didn't support her. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might have had his own reasons, like feeling the method was wrong, but that doesn't excuse not helping. The core issue is about empathy and shared responsibility. The boyfriend's lack of help during a crisis isn't acceptable. The author isn't wrong for expecting some level of support or at least politeness from her partner. \n\nSo, the answer is B (author not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
