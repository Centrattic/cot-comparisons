I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a boyfriend who didn't help during a toilet clog situation and instead lay down while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then urged the author to give up. The author tried for two more hours. Then, when the author's dad came, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad was upset because the BF didn't contribute, and the BF later criticized the dad's method.\n\nThe BF's reasoning is that he allowed the dad to help, so he should be grateful. But the author feels that the BF should have been more helpful and showed basic courtesy. \n\nCommon courtesy in such situations usually involves helping or at least being respectful. Lying down while someone else is working on a problem, especially a messy one, might be seen as inconsiderate. The BF's attitude of not helping and dismissing the urgency could be a problem. The dad felt disrespected, which is a strong indicator that the BF's actions were inappropriate.\n\nThe author's dad was doing a favor, and expecting some level of assistance or respect is reasonable. The BF's response of not helping and later criticizing the method might come off as ungrateful. Even if the BF didn't agree with the dad's approach, that's not an excuse to not contribute or be present.\n\nHowever, the BF did try initially, but maybe not enough. But once the author's dad came, the BF didn't step up. In such a scenario, the BF's lack of action and disrespectful behavior towards the dad is likely the main issue here. The author isn't wrong for expecting her BF to help or be courteous. Therefore, the BF is more likely in the wrong here. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
