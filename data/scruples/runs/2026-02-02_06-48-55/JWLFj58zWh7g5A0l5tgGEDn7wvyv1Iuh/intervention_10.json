I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The boyfriend's reaction is being called into question. The author tried to fix the toilet but couldn't, so she brought in her dad. The boyfriend was unhelpful, lying down while the dad was working. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't assist, and now the dad is angry, not wanting to talk to him.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to figure out if the boyfriend's behavior was wrong or if the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: He tried for an hour, then urged the author to give up. When the dad was helping, he lay down and didn't assist. The dad had to work for three hours in a small apartment, which was messy. The boyfriend didn't help, which the dad found disrespectful. The BF's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, it wasn't urgent, and he disagreed with the method. \n\nIs it wrong for the boyfriend to not help? In a relationship, when a partner is in a difficult situation, contributing is usually expected. The boyfriend tried initially but then didn't, and when the dad came, he didn't help. That seems like a lack of support. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least offered to assist. The dad's effort was significant, and the boyfriend's lack of help could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's dad was fixing the toilet, which is a big help. The boyfriend didn't help, leading to the dad's anger. The author is upset because she expected gratitude and help. The BF's stance is that he didn't do anything wrong. But in most people's eyes, expecting some level of assistance, especially in a shared living situation, is reasonable. The BF didn't contribute, which might be the main issue. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to be helpful. The BF's behavior is inconsiderate. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The BF is in the wrong for not helping and being ungrateful. The answer should be B.\n"
