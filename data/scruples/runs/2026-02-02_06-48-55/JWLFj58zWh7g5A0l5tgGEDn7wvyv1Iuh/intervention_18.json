I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a boyfriend who was unhelpful when the toilet clogged and the author's dad had to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author thinks her boyfriend was ungrateful and unhelpful. He didn't assist, was annoyed, and even criticized her dad's method. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he allowed her dad to fix it, which he sees as sufficient, and that he didn't agree with the method. He also downplayed the urgency. The author feels he should have been more helpful and grateful.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be wrong, but they want to explore it. So, where's the line here? In relationships, mutual support and respect are important. When a guest (the father) is helping, the host (the boyfriend) should at least be respectful and offer assistance. Lying down and not helping, especially when the father is dealing with a messy situation, could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent might be a stretch if the toilet was completely clogged for days. The author and her dad were actively working on it, and his lack of involvement could be seen as a failure to pitch in. Also, the father was doing a favor, and the boyfriend's attitude might have caused hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he didn't know how to help or disagreed with the method, but that doesn't excuse not helping at all. There are other ways to assist, like cleaning up or supporting the effort. The key points here are whether the boyfriend contributed in any way and if his behavior was respectful towards the father.\n\nThe author's dad was angry, which suggests that the boyfriend's actions were offensive. The boyfriend's reasoning that the author should be grateful he allowed the dad to fix it is weak. Allowing someone to do the work doesn't negate the need for personal involvement or respect.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting gratitude and support from her partner, especially in a stressful situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
