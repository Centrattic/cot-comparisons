I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author have been together for four years and are living together. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had some stomach issues. The author tried to fix it but couldn't, so they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. Because their apartment is small with no other bathroom, the situation was really inconvenient. The author then asked her dad to help, which the boyfriend agreed to but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. \n\nWhen the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the dad and the author worked. After three hours, the dad fixed it, but the boyfriend was upset that the dad needed to take a shower and get clean clothes. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't help and was ungrateful. The boyfriend's reasoning was that he didn't have to help, it wasn't urgent, and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. The author is upset, thinking the boyfriend should have been more helpful and grateful.\n\nThe user who posted the question thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. They're asking for an answer of A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nHmm. Let me think. The key points here are about responsibility and gratitude. The author's dad came to help fix a toilet that was causing significant inconvenience. The boyfriend didn't contribute during the process and acted dismissively afterward. The author is frustrated because she expected her boyfriend to be more helpful and show gratitude. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, when someone helps you with a task that's unpleasant and time-consuming, especially in your own home, there's an expectation of being polite and appreciative. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not assisting, plus being annoyed afterward, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's dad was helping out of kindness, and the boyfriend's refusal to participate or acknowledge the help might be the issue here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to help because he disagreed with the method might be a stretch. Even if he had a different approach, it's customary to at least assist or express gratitude when someone is helping you. Additionally, the author tried to fix it herself first, then the boyfriend tried, but it still wasn't resolved. The dad's help was necessary, and the boyfriend's lack of involvement during that time is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend did agree to let the dad help, so he isn't entirely at fault for the dad's involvement. But his behavior during and after the help is where the problem lies. He didn't show support or appreciation, which led to the dad being upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main grievance is the boyfriend's lack of help and ungrateful attitude. The boyfriend's defense is that he didn't have to help and that it wasn't urgent. However, the urgency of the situation (no bathroom available) and the effort required from the dad (three hours of work) should matter. \n\nIn terms of social norms, expecting someone to be polite and help when a family member is assisting is reasonable. The boyfriend's failure to meet those expectations likely makes him the one at fault here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
