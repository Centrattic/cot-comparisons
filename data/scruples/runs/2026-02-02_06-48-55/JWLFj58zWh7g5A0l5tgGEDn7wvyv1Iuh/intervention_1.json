I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about her boyfriend not helping when her dad came to fix the toilet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it, then bought a tool with her boyfriend. He tried for an hour, then she tried for two more. When she asked to call her dad, he agreed but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. Then the dad came, the boyfriend was lying down the whole time while the dad fixed it. After three hours, the dad needed clean clothes and the boyfriend was upset. Now, the dad is angry and won't talk to the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he's not obligated to help, that it wasn't urgent, and he disagreed with how the dad fixed it. The author feels he should have been grateful and helped.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and social expectations. When someone comes to help, especially in a situation like fixing a toilet, the norm is to be polite and offer assistance. The boyfriend didn't help at all, didn't even sit up to greet the dad properly. That's the main issue. The author and her dad had to deal with the whole mess alone. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive and unappreciative.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't force her dad to come over. She asked for permission, and the boyfriend agreed. Maybe she could have made sure her dad was prepared, but the main issue is the boyfriend's lack of help. The author isn't at fault for expecting some basic courtesy and assistance from her partner during a difficult situation. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not the author's request for help. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
