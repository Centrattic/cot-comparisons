I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet clogged and instead lying down while the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours without success. Then the author asked for her dad's help, which the boyfriend agreed to, though with a red flag about not helping if things went wrong. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three-hour process. Afterward, he was upset that the dad needed clean clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it and that he disagreed with how the dad was doing it. The author feels he should have been more helpful and respectful.\n\nThe author is confused because she thinks her boyfriend should have shown gratitude towards her dad, but he didn't help at all. Now the dad is upset and won't speak to him. The author is questioning if she's in the wrong, even though she thinks the boyfriend is.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. But based on the situation, it seems like the boyfriend didn't contribute, was unhelpful, and ungrateful. The author sought help because they were stuck in a small apartment without another bathroom, which adds to the pressure. The boyfriend's lack of effort and respect for the author's dad seems problematic. The author's dad did the work, and the boyfriend's attitude made it worse. Therefore, the author is probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
