I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and instead laid down while the author and her dad dealt with it. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend had already tried to unclog the toilet for an hour, but then when the author's dad arrived, he just laid down. The dad ended up fixing it, and the boyfriend was unhelpful during that time. The boyfriend's justification is that he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it and that he thought it wasn't urgent. The author feels he should have been more grateful and helpful.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the boyfriend act inconsiderately? Should he have assisted even if he disagreed with the method? Is expecting gratitude reasonable?\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he allowed the dad to fix it, which he sees as sufficient. But the author and her dad felt he was ungrateful and unhelpful. The boyfriend's laying down while the problem was being resolved by someone else might come off as dismissive or rude, especially in a stressful situation. The dad was doing a favor, and the boyfriend's lack of assistance could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's claim that he disagreed with the method isn't a strong excuse for not offering help. Even if you disagree, you can politely ask or offer alternative suggestions. Lying down and doing nothing in such a scenario is likely to be perceived as inconsiderate. The fact that the dad was cleaning a clogged toilet, which is messy and stressful, and the boyfriend didn't contribute makes his behavior worse.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone helps you with a problem, especially a messy one, the expected behavior is to be grateful and offer assistance. The boyfriend's failure to do so is a breach of basic courtesy. The author's frustration is valid here. The boyfriend's response that it wasn't urgent is contradictory since the toilet was clogged for days, leading to a messy situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate and ungrateful, so she's not at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
