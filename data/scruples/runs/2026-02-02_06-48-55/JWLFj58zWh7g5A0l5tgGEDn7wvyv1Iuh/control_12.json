I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's toilet clogged after he had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it first, then they bought an auger. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then she tried for two more hours while he told her to give up. Then she called her dad, who came over while the BF was lying down the whole time. The dad fixed it, but the BF didn't help, was ungrateful, and even got upset when the dad needed clean clothes. Now the dad is angry, and the BF says the author is in the wrong, thinking he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me think. The BF didn't help during the toilet repair. The author tried multiple times, then called her dad for help. The BF was uncooperative, didn't assist when the dad was there, and was dismissive of the problem's urgency. His reasoning is that he let the dad help and that the problem wasn't urgent. However, the toilet wasn't working for two days, causing a mess and inconvenience. The BF didn't contribute, which is expected in a partner. Also, the BF criticized the dad's method and didn't support the author. The dad's anger seems justified because the BF was passive and unhelpful. The author's expectation of common courtesy is reasonable. So, the BF's behavior is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
