I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a couple dealing with a clogged toilet. The author's boyfriend was unhelpful during the process. The author had a friend (her dad) come over to fix it, and the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The boyfriend is defending his actions by saying he let the dad fix it and that he didn't like how he did it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The author is upset because her boyfriend didn't help and even annoyed her dad. The boyfriend thinks he did nothing wrong because he allowed the dad to fix it. But the author expects gratitude and help from her boyfriend.\n\nThe apartment is small, so the toilet clogging is a big issue since there's no other bathroom. The boyfriend didn't help when they first tried to unclog it. He tried for an hour, then told her to give up. Then when her dad came, he just laid down and didn't assist. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend even got annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that it wasn't that urgent and he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it. But not helping at all when there's a family member coming over to fix something that affects their home seems like a lack of basic courtesy. Even if he didn't like the method, he could have at least helped or showed some respect to the dad.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong. The question is whether the boyfriend's behavior was acceptable. From what I read, the boyfriend didn't contribute, was dismissive of the problem's urgency, and didn't help his partner or her dad. That seems like he's in the wrong. The author isn't wrong to feel upset about that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
