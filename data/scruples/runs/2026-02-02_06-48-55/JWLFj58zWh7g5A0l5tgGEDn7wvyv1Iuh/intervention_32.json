I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a toilet clog that the couple tried to fix, then the author's dad came to help. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, and later got upset when the dad asked for clean clothes. The boyfriend claims he did nothing wrong, while the author feels he was being inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the toilet was clogged for two days, they tried tools, then called the author's dad. The boyfriend didn't help during the dad's visit and was ungrateful. The dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't contribute, and the author is upset too. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't want to help and thought it wasn't urgent. The author thinks the boyfriend should have been grateful.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B).\n\nI need to evaluate the situation. The boyfriend didn't help, was ungrateful, and his behavior caused tension. The author asked if the boyfriend was wrong. The boyfriend's actions lack basic courtesy and contribution. The author's dad is a helper who got dirty, and the boyfriend's refusal to assist or show gratitude is the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting gratitude; it's reasonable. So the boyfriend is in the wrong, which means the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
