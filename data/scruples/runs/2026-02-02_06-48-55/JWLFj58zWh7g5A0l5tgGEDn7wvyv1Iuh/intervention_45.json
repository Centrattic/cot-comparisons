I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a clogged toilet that they couldn't fix themselves, leading to their boyfriend's dad coming over. The key points are the boyfriend's behavior during the repair.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged for a few days, and both tried to fix it. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author for two hours. Then the author's dad comes in because they can't fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked. The author is upset because the BF didn't help and was ungrateful towards her dad. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't do anything wrong and even allowed the dad to help, and he disagreed with how he fixed it. He also mentioned he wouldn't have helped if things went wrong, which might be a red flag.\n\nThe user is the author, and she's asking if she's the asshole here. The author is upset because the BF didn't contribute and was rude. The BF thinks he's not in the wrong because he let the dad help and didn't see the urgency. \n\nNow, to determine who is right. The BF didn't help during the repair, even though he was there. He was lying down while the author's dad was working in a messy situation. The BF's attitude seems dismissive and ungrateful. Even if he was annoyed about the situation, the dad did a favor by fixing the toilet. The BF's lack of help and the dad's anger make the BF's behavior seem inconsiderate. The author's dad was helping out, and the BF didn't show respect or assistance during the process. \n\nThe author's dad was helping in a difficult situation, and the BF's response was to be passive and critical. The author felt the BF should be grateful, which is a reasonable expectation. The BF's justification that it wasn't urgent might not excuse his lack of action. In a shared living situation, contributing or at least showing appreciation is expected. The BF's behavior here comes off as selfish and uncooperative. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The BF's actions (or inactions) and attitude are problematic. The author is justified in being upset because the BF didn't help and showed disrespect towards her dad's efforts. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
