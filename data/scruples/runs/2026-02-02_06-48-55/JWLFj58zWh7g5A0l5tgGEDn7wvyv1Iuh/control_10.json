I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend refusing to help with unclogging the toilet and then not being grateful when the author's dad fixed it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to fix it, bought tools, and then their boyfriend tried for an hour before she took over for two more hours. He kept telling her to give up. Then she asked her dad to help, which he agreed but with a warning. The dad came, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. After three hours, the problem was fixed. The boyfriend was uncooperative and even upset that the dad needed clean clothes. Now he's blaming the author for expecting him to be grateful.\n\nThe author is upset because the BF didn't contribute and wasn't respectful. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't need to help and the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it. The BF also thinks the situation wasn't urgent enough.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. When someone helps you, especially with something as personal and unpleasant as a clogged toilet, gratitude is expected. The BF didn't help at all and was uncooperative. Lying down while the dad was working and not offering assistance could be seen as disrespectful. The author's BF's attitude seems dismissive and unhelpful.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support and respect are important. The BF's behavior might be seen as neglecting his responsibility to contribute and showing ingratitude. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her BF to at least help or show appreciation. The BF's stance that it's not a big deal and he didn't need to help is questionable. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the BF was frustrated with the problem and wanted the author's dad to fix it, but even so, being unhelpful and ungrateful is still an issue. Also, the fact that they live together means they should share responsibilities. The BF's refusal to help when the author was struggling is a problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He didn't contribute and was ungrateful. The answer should be B.\n"
