I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author's boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and the author's dad came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, and later got upset when the dad needed to borrow clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. They tried to fix it themselves, but it took a long time and was very unpleasant. The author wanted to call her dad, and the boyfriend agreed but didn't help. The dad took three hours, did all the work, and the boyfriend was just laying down. The dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't help, and the boyfriend's response was that he didn't think it was urgent and he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it. He also said the author should be grateful he let her dad in.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for expecting her boyfriend to help or be respectful towards her dad?\n\nLet me think about social norms and expectations. When someone comes to help you, especially in a messy situation, it's customary for the host (the boyfriend) to assist or at least show appreciation. The boyfriend didn't contribute and even criticized the method. That's a problem. Also, the dad's clothes were soiled, and the boyfriend was upset about needing to give him shorts, which seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning seems to be that he didn't have to help and that the author should be grateful. But that's not typical. People usually expect reciprocity and respect in such situations. The boyfriend's inaction and lack of gratitude are likely the main issues here. The author is upset because she expected her boyfriend to support the effort and show respect to her dad. The dad was helping, so the boyfriend's behavior was dismissive and unhelpful.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend might have felt overwhelmed or not wanted to engage in the messy task. But even if that's the case, he should have communicated differently and at least shown respect to the dad who is helping. Laying down while someone else is working hard is passive and not supportive.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about not helping if things went wrong is a red flag, indicating a lack of willingness to take responsibility. That's a sign of poor teamwork in a relationship. The boyfriend's attitude comes off as selfish and ungrateful, which is why the author feels wronged.\n\nIn terms of the author's perspective, she's right to expect her boyfriend to contribute or at least be courteous. The dad's anger is understandable given the boyfriend's lack of assistance and disrespect. The boyfriend's justification doesn't hold up because the situation was clearly urgent and unpleasant, and his response was inadequate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author is justified in her feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
