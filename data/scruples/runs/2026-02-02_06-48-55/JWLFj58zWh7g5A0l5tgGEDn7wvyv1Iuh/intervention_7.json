I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a clogged toilet, the boyfriend's reaction, and the author's dad fixing it.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was supposed to help unclog the toilet. He tried for an hour, then the author took over for two hours. The author then called her dad for help. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down, didn't assist during the 3 hours it took to fix, and later got upset about the dad needing a shower and clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad help and that he didn't agree with the method, so he did nothing. The author and her dad feel he was ungrateful and unhelpful.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nThe key points here: The boyfriend didn't help when the family friend (dad) was there. Even if he disagreed with the method, he could have at least assisted or showed basic courtesy. The dad worked for 3 hours in a disgusting situation, and the boyfriend's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate. The author called her dad when her BF wasn't making progress, which is understandable. The BF's refusal to help during the repair and his attitude afterward are likely the main issues. The author's dad is upset, and the BF isn't acknowledging the help. In many cultures, showing gratitude and helping when someone is doing a favor is expected. The BF's behavior seems dismissive and ungrateful. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting her BF to be polite and assist. So the BF is likely at fault here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
