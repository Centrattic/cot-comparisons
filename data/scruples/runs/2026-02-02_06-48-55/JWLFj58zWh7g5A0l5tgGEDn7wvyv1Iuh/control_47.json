I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who was lying down while the author's dad fixed a clogged toilet. The boyfriend didn't help and even had some issues with the way the dad was doing it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The toilet was clogged, they tried to fix it themselves, but eventually called the author's dad. The BF was lying down the whole time, didn't help, and later got annoyed when the dad needed clean clothes. The BF's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it and it wasn't urgent. The author feels that the BF should have been more helpful and respectful.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The BF's actions seem to lack basic courtesy and participation. When someone helps out, especially in a situation that's physically demanding and unpleasant (like dealing with a clogged toilet), it's expected that the person being helped would contribute in some way. The BF didn't help during the process and even made the dad uncomfortable by not offering assistance. His attitude of being ungrateful and passive is problematic.\n\nThe BF's justification that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method seems weak. Disagreement doesn't absolve someone from contributing or showing respect. Moreover, in an emergency situation like not having a working toilet, it's reasonable to expect some level of cooperation. The BF's behavior could be seen as entitled and disrespectful, especially towards the author's dad who went out of his way to help.\n\nThe author's expectations of gratitude and common courtesy seem reasonable. The BF's response of dismissing the situation's urgency and not helping is where the issue lies. The dad's anger is justified given the BF's lack of assistance and the unpleasant situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
