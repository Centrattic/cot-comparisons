I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's boyfriend during a toilet clog situation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The toilet clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The author tried to unclog it, bought tools, and then the boyfriend tried for an hour. Then the author spent two hours trying. They asked the author's dad to help, and the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad fixed it, got dirty, and asked for shorts, which the boyfriend didn't appreciate. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and thought it wasn't such a big deal.\n\nThe author feels the boyfriend should have helped or at least been more courteous, while the boyfriend doesn't see the issue. The question is if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer based on the given context. The key points here are about responsibility, effort, and social expectations. The boyfriend wasn't helping when the problem was urgent, and he didn't assist when the author's dad was working. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive and ungrateful, especially since the problem was causing significant inconvenience. \n\nSocial norms generally expect people to contribute when there's a shared problem, especially in a living situation. The boyfriend's refusal to help and his attitude towards the author's dad, who came to assist, could be seen as lacking consideration. The author isn't wrong for expecting some effort or gratitude from her partner. The boyfriend's behavior might stem from a different perspective on responsibility, but the author's expectations are reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
