I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not helping when the toilet clogged and being uncooperative when the author's dad came to fix it. The boyfriend was lying down, didn't help, and even had issues with the dad's approach. The author is upset because she expected more help and courtesy from her boyfriend. She thinks he's at fault, but the user says they think the author is in the wrong, which is a bit confusing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged, boyfriend tried for an hour, author tried for two more hours. Then they called the author's dad. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked. The author's dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't help. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he should be grateful for allowing the dad to fix it, and he thought it wasn't urgent. He also disagreed with how the dad fixed it. The author feels her boyfriend should have been more helpful and respectful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the boyfriend's behavior was wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but now is unsure. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user's initial statement is, \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\" Wait, no, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Wait, the original question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" So the author is the one in the AITA post. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the user themselves think the author is in the wrong (since they say \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think\").\n\nWait, but the AITA post is from the author's perspective. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset with their boyfriend. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So if the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), that would mean the author's reaction is wrong. Alternatively, if B (No, the author is not in the wrong), then the author is right to be upset.\n\nNow, to analyze. The boyfriend didn't help while the author and her dad were working. He was uncooperative, didn't assist, and was dismissive. The author's dad was upset because he had to do all the work. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he allowed the dad to fix it and that it wasn't urgent. But the author and her dad had to deal with the clogged toilet for days, and the boyfriend didn't contribute. His behavior of lying down while the problem was being fixed could be seen as not helping when needed. In a partnership, especially in a small apartment where the toilet is next to the bed, not helping during a crisis might be considered inconsiderate. The boyfriend's lack of assistance and the dismissive attitude towards the urgency of the problem could be seen as his fault. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's actions (or inactions) were inappropriate, so the author is right to be upset. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
