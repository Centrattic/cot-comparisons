I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their boyfriend's behavior during a toilet clog situation.\n\nSo, the toilet was clogged, and the boyfriend tried for an hour but then stopped, urging the author to give up. The author's dad had to come over, and during that time, the boyfriend was lying down doing nothing. The dad got angry because the boyfriend wasn't helping. The boyfriend claims he didn't do anything wrong, says the author should be grateful he let the dad fix it, and even says the problem wasn't that urgent. The author feels like the boyfriend should have been more helpful and showed more respect to her dad.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, the boyfriend didn't contribute after his initial hour. The dad had to work for three hours in a disgusting situation, and the boyfriend didn't help. The author is upset that the boyfriend isn't showing gratitude or effort. The boyfriend seems dismissive of the situation's urgency and didn't offer help even when it was clear it was a big problem.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about expectations in a relationship. Normally, when a partner is in a situation like this, they're expected to help each other. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then stopped and didn't help further. When the author's dad arrived, the boyfriend didn't assist, which might be seen as disrespectful or not contributing. The dad was working hard in a messy situation, and the boyfriend being unhelpful could be perceived as not supporting his partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning seems to be that he allowed the author's dad to help, so he should be grateful. But allowing someone to do the work doesn't negate the need to assist in the process. The boyfriend's lack of effort might be considered inconsiderate, especially given the stress and physical work involved.\n\nHowever, maybe the boyfriend felt he had done his part. But when a partner's family comes over to help, it's customary to at least assist or show appreciation. The boyfriend's attitude that he did nothing wrong might stem from a different view on responsibility in relationships. But generally, expecting some level of help and respect in such a situation is not delusional.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He didn't contribute when needed, dismissed the problem's urgency, and didn't show proper respect for the author's dad. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
