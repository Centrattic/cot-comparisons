I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend being unhelpful and ungrateful when her dad had to fix a clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The toilet was clogged, they tried to fix it themselves without success. The boyfriend used an auger for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When they asked her dad to help, the boyfriend was lying down while the work was done. Her dad ended up doing all the work, was ungrateful, and the boyfriend even said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend is dismissing the urgency and the dad's efforts.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend didn't contribute and wasn't grateful. The boyfriend thinks he did nothing wrong, claims it wasn't urgent, and that he didn't agree with the method her dad used. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the key points to consider: Was the boyfriend's behavior inconsiderate? Did he have a responsibility to help? Is it unreasonable to expect gratitude? \n\nIn relationships, especially in a shared living situation, contributing when a problem arises is usually expected. The boyfriend was there during the process, tried for a while but then stopped, and then didn't help when the dad arrived. Lying down while someone else is doing a messy, physical job might be seen as disrespectful or unhelpful. The dad is a guest, and showing respect and assistance to family is important. The boyfriend's dismissal of the situation and the dad's efforts is likely to cause tension.\n\nThe author's dad was doing a favor, and the boyfriend's lack of gratitude and active disengagement could be seen as inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to at least be respectful and helpful. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
