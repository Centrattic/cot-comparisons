I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who didn't help during a toilet clog issue and instead laid down while the author and her dad worked on it. The boyfriend's attitude and lack of support are the main points of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's actions. He tried for an hour, then urged her to give up. When her dad came, he laid down and didn't help. The author and her dad worked for three hours, dealing with a messy and smelly situation. The boyfriend's response was to be uncooperative and ungrateful towards the author's dad, which led to the dad being upset.\n\nThe author feels wronged because she expected more support and basic courtesy from her boyfriend. The boyfriend, on the other hand, claims he did nothing wrong, that it wasn't urgent, and that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method her dad used. \n\nFrom a common sense perspective, when someone comes to help, especially a partner's parent, it's expected to at least offer assistance or show gratitude. The boyfriend's lack of action and disrespectful behavior towards the father could be seen as inconsiderate. The situation was clearly urgent given the apartment's size and the lack of an alternative bathroom. \n\nThe author isn't asking for validation here; she's seeking an understanding of right and wrong. The boyfriend's reasoning that he's not obligated to help and that the situation wasn't urgent seems dismissive of the actual problem they faced. Not contributing to solving a major household issue when it's affecting their living conditions might be seen as his fault.\n\nHowever, sometimes people might feel that they've already tried and given up, leading them to step back. But in this case, the boyfriend didn't offer help when his partner was struggling and then showed no gratitude. The dad's anger is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions\u2014laziness, lack of support, and disrespect towards the father\u2014make him at fault. The author's expectation of basic courtesy and help is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
