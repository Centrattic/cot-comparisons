I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main issue here is about the boyfriend's behavior when the author's dad came to fix the clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's boyfriend was already trying to unclog the toilet before the dad arrived. He tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. Then the author asked if they could call her dad, and the boyfriend agreed. When the dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help, which upset both the author and her dad. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it and that he didn't need to help. He also mentions he let the dad fix it, so he feels he did his part.\n\nThe author is upset because she expects gratitude and help from her boyfriend when her dad comes over. The dad was doing a favor, and the boyfriend's inaction led to the dad being angry. The key points here are about expectations of help and respect in a situation where someone is doing a favor.\n\nNow, considering social norms and common courtesy, when someone comes to help, especially a family member, it's generally expected that the host (in this case, the boyfriend) would at least be respectful, offer assistance, and show appreciation. Lying down and not engaging could be seen as dismissive or ungrateful. The boyfriend's excuse that he disagreed with the method isn't a strong justification for not helping at all. He could have offered alternative methods or discussed his concerns but not ignored the situation entirely.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is that he allowed the dad to fix it, which he sees as a positive. The author might feel that his lack of action was disrespectful. The question is whether the boyfriend's actions crossed a line into being inconsiderate, making the author the \"not in the wrong\" one.\n\nIn these situations, it's often about mutual respect and effort. The boyfriend's inaction, despite the dad's efforts, likely contributed to the conflict. The author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to show some level of respect and help, especially in a stressful situation. Therefore, the boyfriend's behavior might be the issue here, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
