I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a clogged toilet and the boyfriend's behavior during the process.\n\nFirst, the toilet was clogged after the boyfriend had stomach issues. The couple tried to fix it over two days. The boyfriend didn't help much, and when the author's dad came to fix it, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't contribute. The dad was upset because the BF didn't help, and the BF claims it's not urgent and he didn't agree with how the dad fixed it. The author is upset that the BF wasn't helpful and showed no gratitude.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms here. When someone helps you, especially with something as unpleasant as fixing a clogged toilet, showing basic courtesy and some level of participation is expected. The BF didn't help, didn't engage, and then criticized the method. That seems like a breach of etiquette. The author expects gratitude and active help, which is reasonable. The BF's attitude of dismissing the urgency and not contributing might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The BF might have felt incapable or maybe had a different opinion on the method. However, even if he disagreed, not participating at all when it's a problem in their home seems wrong. Especially when the author was already struggling for hours. \n\nAlso, having the BF lay down while the author and her dad were working is probably seen as not pulling his weight. The dad coming over to help is a big favor, and the BF's lack of gratitude could strain the relationship. \n\nGiven that, the author isn't in the wrong. The BF's behavior is the issue. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
