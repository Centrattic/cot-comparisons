I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving their boyfriend and a clogged toilet. The boyfriend didn't help much and was laying down while the author and her dad handled it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The toilet was clogged for days, causing a mess. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then urged the author to give up. When her dad came, the boyfriend didn't help but instead laid down. The dad got angry because the BF didn't contribute.\n\nFrom a social courtesy perspective, when someone helps out, especially in a situation like this, you're expected to be grateful and maybe even assist. The BF's attitude seems dismissive. He's not helping, and he's annoyed that the author sought help from her dad. The fact that he agreed to let the dad come but then didn't do anything is a problem. \n\nThe BF's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he let her dad fix it. But his lack of effort and his attitude during the process probably contributed to the dad's anger. The author isn't wrong for expecting some level of cooperation or basic courtesy from her BF, especially since they live together. \n\nThe BF's justification that it wasn't urgent doesn't hold up when there was a pool of shit next to the bed. The author had to handle it, and involving her dad was a necessary step. The BF's reaction to the dad's soiled clothes also seems petty. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She needed help, asked for it, and the BF's response was inadequate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
