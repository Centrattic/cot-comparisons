I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their relationship situation. The situation involves a clogged toilet that the boyfriend didn't help fix, instead lying down while the author and her dad dealt with it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more hours. When their father came over, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The author and her dad did all the work. The boyfriend's argument is that he let her dad help, so he's not wrong. The author and her dad are upset because he didn't contribute.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility in a partnership and social etiquette. In a relationship, especially when living together, mutual support is expected. The boyfriend had already tried but gave up, which might be reasonable if it was a personal limit. However, when the father came over, the boyfriend didn't help despite the mess and the effort of others. Lying down during such a task could be seen as disrespectful or neglecting shared responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he did his part by trying and then stepping back if he felt it was beyond his capacity. But in a crisis situation like a non-working toilet, contributing is usually expected. The fact that the author's father was there and did all the work, while the boyfriend remained passive, could be a breach of expected help and hospitality.\n\nThe author's dad being angry makes sense because it's customary to assist guests when they're doing such tasks. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and dismissing the urgency might have crossed a line. The author's frustration is valid as she's caught between her partner's lack of support and her father's anger.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting support from her partner in such a situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
