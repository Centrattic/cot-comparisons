I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a toilet clog that the author and her boyfriend tried to fix, then her dad came over and did the work. The boyfriend was laying down during the process, didn't help, and later criticized the approach. The author and her dad were upset, and the dad is now angry. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help, that it wasn't urgent, and that he just let the dad fix it. The author feels he should have been more grateful and involved.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's dad came over to help, which is a favor. The boyfriend didn't contribute and even seemed dismissive. From a social standpoint, when someone does a favor, expecting at least some level of gratitude or participation is reasonable. The boyfriend's attitude of not helping and being critical might come off as unappreciative and passive. \n\nThe author's request for help from her dad was approved by the boyfriend, but his behavior during the visit\u2014laying down, not assisting, and later criticizing the method\u2014could be seen as disrespectful toward her dad's effort. The dad's anger seems justified given the effort he put in and the lack of support from the boyfriend. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might argue that he wasn't obligated to help, especially if he didn't agree with the method. But in a shared living situation, contributing to problem-solving is usually expected. Not helping, especially when the problem affects the entire household, could be seen as neglecting shared responsibilities. \n\nThe author's expectations are about common courtesy and shared responsibilities. The boyfriend's stance might be more about his own discomfort or lack of willingness to engage in a messy task. But social norms generally expect some level of participation or at least respectful acknowledgment of someone's help, even if you disagree with their approach.\n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate and lacked appreciation for the effort of the author's dad. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to be more helpful and respectful in that situation. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
