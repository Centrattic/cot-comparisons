I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving their boyfriend and their dad. The scenario is about a clogged toilet that they couldn't fix themselves, so they asked the author's dad to help. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked and didn't offer help. The author is upset because the BF didn't help, and the dad was angry too.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the BF's actions. The toilet was a mess, and the BF didn't contribute. The author mentions he tried for an hour initially, but then stopped and urged her to give up. When the dad arrived, he laid down and didn't assist. That seems passive, maybe even dismissive. The BF's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, but that doesn't sound like a valid excuse. Usually, when someone helps you, you're supposed to be grateful and maybe offer some form of support, even if you disagree with their method.\n\nThe author's expectations might be about common courtesy. The BF's lack of action could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the dad had to take time out of his day to help. The BF's attitude of being ungrateful might be the main issue here. The dad's anger makes sense given the situation. \n\nBut wait, maybe the BF felt it was his decision to let the dad fix it. But in a relationship, teamwork is expected. If the BF was part of the problem and didn't help resolve it, that's a problem. Also, the BF's reaction to the dad's needs (like needing shorts) being a red flag might indicate he's not considerate of others' needs. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. She's upset because the BF didn't act appropriately. The BF's behavior was inconsiderate and unhelpful. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
