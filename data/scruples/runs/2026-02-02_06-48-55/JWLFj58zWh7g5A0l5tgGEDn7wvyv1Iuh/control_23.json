I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a woman in a 4-year relationship) is in the wrong when her boyfriend didn't help during a toilet clog situation.\n\nSo, here's the situation: The toilet clogged after her boyfriend had stomach issues. They tried to unclog it themselves, but it wasn't working. They bought an auger, he tried for an hour, then she tried for two more hours. She asked her dad to help because it was really bad. The boyfriend agreed but then laid down while her dad worked. The dad fixed it, but the boyfriend was annoyed when he needed clean clothes. Now the dad is angry, and the boyfriend claims the author is at fault for expecting him to help.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations of help and respect. The boyfriend didn't assist during the repair and was dismissive of her request for her dad. The author feels he should have been grateful, but he thinks it wasn't urgent and that he did nothing because he disagreed with how the dad fixed it.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone helps you, especially with something unpleasant like a toilet clog, it's customary to at least be present, offer help, and show appreciation. The boyfriend didn't help, didn't engage while her dad was working, and was passive. That seems disrespectful. The author isn't asking if her dad was right to be angry, but whether she's wrong in expecting basic courtesy from her boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he didn't have to help because he disagreed with the method is a bit flimsy. If someone is coming to help, especially a family member, it's not really about agreeing with the method but showing respect. Also, the boyfriend had already tried and failed, so his contribution was minimal. The fact that he laid down while the dad worked and then complained about the mess seems rude.\n\nSo the author isn't wrong in expecting her boyfriend to be more helpful or respectful. Her dad's reaction is understandable given the lack of effort from the boyfriend. The boyfriend's attitude of doing nothing and being ungrateful is the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
