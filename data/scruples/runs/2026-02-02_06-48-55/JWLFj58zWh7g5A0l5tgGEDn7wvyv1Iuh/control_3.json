I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her boyfriend were dealing with a clogged toilet. They tried unclogging it themselves, but it didn't work. Then they called the author's dad. While the dad was working, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad got angry because the boyfriend didn't assist, and the boyfriend is unapologetic, thinking he did nothing wrong. The author is upset because she expected the boyfriend to be more helpful and respectful during the situation.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the description, the key points are: the boyfriend didn't help when a family member came to fix a serious problem, he was uncooperative, and he dismissed the urgency. The author feels he should be grateful, while the boyfriend thinks it's not a big deal.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone helps you, especially in a difficult or messy situation, it's customary to show appreciation and assist. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not helping could be seen as disrespectful and ungrateful. The situation was urgent because they didn't have another bathroom, which adds to the stress. The author's dad was doing the hard work, and expecting some level of cooperation from the boyfriend is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that he disagreed with how the dad was fixing it doesn't justify his inaction. If he had concerns, he could have expressed them respectfully or at least helped in another way. His refusal to help and his attitude likely contributed to the dad's anger.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expecting her boyfriend to be more helpful and respectful. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and lacks the consideration expected in such a situation. The author is seeking validation for her perspective, which seems valid here. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
