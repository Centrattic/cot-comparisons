I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend didn't help when her dad was fixing a really clogged toilet. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked for three hours, and he also didn't seem to appreciate the help. The author is upset because she expected more help and gratitude from her boyfriend, but he thinks she's overreacting and that he did nothing wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author tried to fix the toilet herself, then her boyfriend tried for an hour, and she tried more. Since they couldn't fix it, she called her dad. The BF was okay with that but didn't help. When the dad arrived, the BF laid down and didn't assist. The dad worked for three hours, and after, the BF was upset about the dad needing clean clothes. The BF's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it. He also said the problem wasn't urgent. \n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and gratitude. When someone you live with is in a difficult situation, especially a messy one like a clogged toilet, it's generally expected that you'd pitch in. The BF didn't help during the entire time the dad was working. Even if he didn't agree with the method, he could have at least offered assistance, especially considering they live together and the problem was a shared issue. The dad's anger makes sense because he's doing a favor, and the BF's lack of respect and help could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for expecting her BF to help. From a social norms perspective, when someone is helping in a household task, especially a messy one, it's customary to show appreciation and offer support. The BF's behavior of lying down and not assisting seems dismissive. Also, the fact that they live together and the problem affected both of them means it's a shared responsibility. The BF's claim that it wasn't urgent is questionable, given the toilet was completely clogged and they had no other bathroom.\n\nHowever, the BF might argue that since he had already tried to fix it without success, he felt there was nothing more to do. But that's not a strong argument, especially when a third party (the dad) is stepping in. Even if he didn't know how to help, he could have at least been present and respectful. The dad's reaction is a sign that the BF's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of the author's expectations, expecting common courtesy and some level of help from her partner isn't unreasonable. The BF's response suggests he might have a different view on household responsibilities and gratitude. But in most cultures, when someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation, you're expected to show appreciation and offer assistance. The BF's inaction and negative reaction to the dad's help (needing clean clothes) indicate a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong here. The BF's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's expectations are reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
