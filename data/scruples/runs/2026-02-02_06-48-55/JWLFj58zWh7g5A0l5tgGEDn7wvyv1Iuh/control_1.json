I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author and her boyfriend have been together four years and live together. The toilet clogged after he had stomach issues. They tried to fix it, but it didn't work. Then they bought an auger, and he tried for an hour while she helped. She tried for two hours, but he kept urging her to give up. Then she asked her dad to help, which the boyfriend agreed to but said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. When her dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help during the three-hour process. The dad got angry because the BF didn't contribute, and now the BF is blaming her for overreacting and not being grateful.\n\nThe author is upset because she expected her boyfriend to help, especially since it was a big mess and they didn't have another bathroom. The BF thinks it wasn't urgent and that he was right to do nothing, even disagreeing with how the dad was fixing it.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? A or B?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone comes over to help with a problem, the host is expected to show gratitude. The boyfriend's lack of participation and lying down while the author and her dad worked is likely seen as unhelpful and rude. The BF's argument that it wasn't urgent seems like a way to downplay the problem. The fact that they live in a small apartment without another bathroom makes the situation more urgent. Also, the BF was the one who caused the clog, so maybe he should be more proactive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the BF felt that since he had already tried and failed, giving up and letting a professional (or the author's dad) handle it was the best approach. But the issue is his attitude and lack of respect during the process. Lying down while the author and her dad are working hard is inconsiderate. The BF's refusal to help and his dismissive attitude might be why the author's dad is so angry.\n\nThe key points here are the BF's lack of assistance, his attitude during the repair, and the fact that the problem was urgent and affected their living conditions. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting her BF to at least be present and helpful, even if he disagrees with the method. Common courtesy would suggest offering help or at least showing appreciation. The BF's response of not helping and being dismissive is likely the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The BF's behavior was inconsiderate and unhelpful, and the author's expectations are reasonable.\n"
