I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend not helping when their toilet was clogged and being uncooperative when her dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's boyfriend tried to unclog the toilet for an hour, then she tried for two more hours. Then she called her dad because things weren't working. When her dad arrived, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad fixed it in three hours while the author helped. The boyfriend didn't offer to help and was unappreciative. The dad got angry, and now the boyfriend is upset with the author for expecting gratitude.\n\nThe author feels wronged because the boyfriend didn't help and wasn't grateful. The boyfriend argues that it wasn't urgent and he didn't agree with her dad's method, so he did nothing. He also says the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the boyfriend act inconsiderately by not helping, and is the author wrong for being upset about that?\n\nFrom a social norm perspective, guests or housemates are usually expected to contribute or at least show appreciation. The boyfriend, even if he's living together, when a parent is helping, expecting him to be passive and not help might be seen as rude. Also, when someone else is doing the work, especially in a messy situation, the expectation is to at least be polite and assist if possible. The boyfriend's refusal to help and being dismissive could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might have had his reasons, like disagreeing with the method, but that's not an excuse to not be helpful. If he didn't agree with the approach, he could have offered his opinion but still assisted in another way. Also, the situation was urgent since they only had one bathroom. The boyfriend's lack of action in such a critical time (where they couldn't use the toilet) could be seen as a failure to support his partner.\n\nThe author's request to call her dad was a reasonable step when they couldn't fix it themselves. The boyfriend allowing it isn't enough; the expectation is that he'd be appreciative or at least polite during the process. Lying around doing nothing while his partner and her dad are working might be seen as selfish.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the boyfriend's actions (or inaction) and lack of gratitude are problematic. The author is justified in feeling upset because she was handling the problem and had to involve her father, expecting support, which wasn't forthcoming. The boyfriend's reasoning that it wasn't urgent is debatable since a non-working toilet is a significant issue. His argument that he didn't help because he disagreed with the method is weak because he could have tried to assist in another way or communicated his concerns constructively.\n\nSo, in this case, the boyfriend is likely at fault for not helping and being ungrateful. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
