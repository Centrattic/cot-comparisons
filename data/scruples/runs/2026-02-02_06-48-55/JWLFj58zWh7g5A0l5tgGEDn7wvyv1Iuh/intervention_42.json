I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when their toilet was clogged and then had the author's dad fix it. The boyfriend was lying down, didn't assist, and even seemed annoyed. The author is upset because they expected the boyfriend to be grateful, especially since the dad had to deal with a messy situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged for a couple of days. They bought tools, tried themselves. The boyfriend tried for an hour, then the author tried for two more. Then the author's dad came, worked for three hours, and the boyfriend was lying down the whole time. The dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't help. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't agree with how the dad was fixing it, but he didn't offer help either.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're the a**hole here, thinking maybe their standards are too high. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nLet me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, when someone comes to help, especially with a messy task, it's reasonable to expect the other person to at least assist or show gratitude. The boyfriend didn't help, was uncooperative, and even criticized the dad's method. That seems inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he tried earlier, but maybe he's not a fan of manual labor or felt it was the author's responsibility. However, when the author's dad was there, the boyfriend didn't contribute. The dad was working hard, and the boyfriend's attitude could be seen as dismissive and unappreciative.\n\nCommon courtesy usually involves showing gratitude when someone helps you, even if you don't agree with their method. The boyfriend's refusal to help or acknowledge the dad's effort is problematic. The author's expectation isn't unreasonable. It's about respect and teamwork in a partnership. The boyfriend's behavior might stem from a lack of consideration for the author's and dad's efforts, which is why the dad is upset.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions (or inactions) led to the conflict. The author is justified in being upset because expecting gratitude and cooperation in such situations is normal. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
