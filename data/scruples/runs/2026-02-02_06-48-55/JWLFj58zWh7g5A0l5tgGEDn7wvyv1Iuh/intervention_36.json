I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who was unhelpful when the author's dad had to fix a clogged toilet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author tried to unclog the toilet herself and with her boyfriend, but he wasn't helpful and then laid down while the dad worked. The boyfriend's reasoning is that it wasn't a big deal and he didn't have to help. The author feels he should have been more grateful and involved.\n\nFrom the author's side, expecting her boyfriend to be helpful during a stressful situation and to show gratitude to her dad for stepping in makes sense. The dad was doing a favor, and it's common to expect at least some effort or courtesy. The boyfriend's lack of assistance and being ungrateful could come off as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he tried earlier and that his opinion about the method his father-in-law used was a reason not to help. However, even if he disagreed, sitting around doing nothing while someone else works is not typically considered helpful or polite.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's inaction and the lack of gratitude. In most social norms, showing appreciation for someone's help is expected. The fact that the dad was covered in waste and had to take a shower, yet was met with resistance from the boyfriend, highlights a lack of respect. The author's frustration is valid because she expected better behavior from her partner.\n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend's actions and attitudes seem to be in the wrong. The author isn't at fault for wanting her partner to be supportive and respectful towards her father during a tough situation. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
