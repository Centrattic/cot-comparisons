I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet was clogged and then was uncooperative when the author's dad came to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author tried to fix the toilet, bought tools, and after that failed, their dad came in. The boyfriend was lying down during the dad's help and didn't assist. He later criticized the dad's method and didn't offer support. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he let the dad fix it, so he should be grateful. But the author feels he should have been more helpful and showed courtesy. The key points here are responsibility during an emergency, respect towards family, and contribution to solving the problem.\n\nIn a shared living situation, especially without another bathroom, the toilet issue would be urgent. Both partners should contribute. The boyfriend tried for an hour but then stopped and discouraged the author. When help came, he didn't assist, which might be seen as neglecting his share of the problem-solving. \n\nRespecting the author's dad is important. Lying down while someone is trying to help is seen as disrespectful in many cultures. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend's attitude made it worse by not helping and criticizing. \n\nThe boyfriend's justification that he didn't need to help because he thought the dad's method was wrong is weak. Even if he disagreed, he could have offered to help in another way or supported the effort. \n\nThe author wanted help and a respectful attitude, which the boyfriend didn't provide. The dad's anger is understandable given the situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend's actions (not helping, being disrespectful) are at fault. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting basic courtesy and assistance. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
