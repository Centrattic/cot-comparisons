I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help with a toilet clog and instead lay down while the author and her dad dealt with it. The author is upset because she expects gratitude and participation, but the boyfriend thinks he did nothing wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around helping when someone is doing you a favor. Typically, when someone comes over to help, especially with something unpleasant like unclogging a toilet, it's expected that you at least show appreciation and maybe offer assistance. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not helping could be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he let her dad fix it, so that's a good thing. But the author points out that he didn't help and even seemed annoyed. Also, the dad was upset because the boyfriend didn't participate. The boyfriend's reasoning that it wasn't urgent is questionable because the toilet wasn't working, which is a basic need, especially in a small apartment without an extra bathroom.\n\nThe author might feel that her boyfriend is not taking responsibility or showing proper courtesy. The boyfriend's attitude of doing nothing and being dismissive about the urgency could be seen as lacking empathy. However, the author also invited her dad in the first place, which might be a point to consider. Did the boyfriend have a right to be annoyed about the dad coming over? Maybe if he was already trying to fix it and it was his idea to get help, then it's different. But in this case, the boyfriend didn't participate, so he's not in a good position to complain.\n\nThe author's dad was cleaning up and the boyfriend didn't help. That's a big no-no. People usually expect some level of cooperation when someone is there to help. The boyfriend's lack of action and attitude might have been a red flag even before the dad came. \n\nOn the other hand, the author asked her boyfriend if she could call her dad, and he said okay. So he agreed to the help. The issue is his behavior during the help. The author is upset because he didn't help and was ungrateful. The boyfriend's reasoning that he disagrees with the dad's method might be an excuse. Disagreement doesn't mean you don't help\u2014it just means you can offer an alternative approach, not sit around doing nothing.\n\nThe author's dad was angry because the boyfriend didn't help. That's a strong reaction, but given the situation, maybe justified. The boyfriend's response of \"I should be grateful he let your dad fix it\" is dismissive. It's not just about letting him fix it, but about his own contribution and attitude.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she asked her boyfriend to help and he refused, then she's not in the wrong. However, maybe she should have handled the situation differently, like taking the dad's help without the boyfriend's presence. But in this case, the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue. The author's dad's anger is a result of the boyfriend's inaction and attitude.\n\nTherefore, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not helping and being ungrateful. The author is not in the wrong for expecting basic courtesy and participation from her partner during a situation where a family member had to come and help with a necessary task. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
