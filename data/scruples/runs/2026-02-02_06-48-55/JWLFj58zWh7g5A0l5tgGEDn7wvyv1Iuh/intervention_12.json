I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who didn't help when the toilet clogged, even though the author's dad had to come over and fix it. The boyfriend was lying down while the dad worked, and later got upset about needing to take a shower in dirty clothes. The author is upset because she thinks the boyfriend should have helped more and shown more gratitude.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The toilet was clogged for days, the boyfriend tried for an hour and then encouraged her to give up. When the author called her dad for help, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't assist. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't help, even getting annoyed about the dirty clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the author should be grateful he allowed her dad to fix it and that he disagreed with the method her dad used.\n\nThe author is upset about the lack of support and gratitude from her boyfriend. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFrom a common courtesy perspective, when someone helps you, especially with a difficult task like fixing a clogged toilet, it's expected that the host would show appreciation and offer help. The boyfriend's behavior of lying down and not assisting seems inconsiderate. He also didn't help clean up or support the author during the process. The dad did most of the work, which is why he was upset.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it wasn't urgent might not hold up since the toilet was non-functional for days. Also, his attitude towards the dad's help (not helping and being annoyed about the shower) is a red flag. The author's expectations seem reasonable\u2014shared responsibility and mutual support in a relationship.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong here. The boyfriend failed to provide support and showed a lack of gratitude. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
