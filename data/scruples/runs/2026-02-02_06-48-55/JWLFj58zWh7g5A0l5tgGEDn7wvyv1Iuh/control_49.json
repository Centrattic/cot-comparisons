I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a toilet clog that the couple tried to fix, but the boyfriend didn't contribute and was unhelpful when the author's dad had to come over.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend tried to fix it for an hour, then the author tried for two hours. When the dad came, the boyfriend was lying down and didn't help. The dad worked for three hours, and the boyfriend didn't offer assistance. Afterward, he was upset that the dad needed clean clothes.\n\nThe boyfriend's arguments are that he allowed the dad to help, so the author should be grateful. He also says it wasn't urgent and that he disagreed with the dad's method. The author and her dad feel unappreciated and frustrated.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, when someone helps out, especially with something as unpleasant as a clogged toilet, it's expected to show gratitude and offer help. The boyfriend's lack of participation and his dismissive attitude towards the problem's urgency and his father-in-law's effort could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for expecting her boyfriend to contribute or show appreciation. The boyfriend's behavior might stem from not valuing the effort or downplaying the situation, but that doesn't make the author wrong for feeling that he should have done more. The key points are his inaction during the problem and his attitude afterward, which likely hurt the author's feelings and strained her relationship with her dad.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend failed to meet basic expectations of helpfulness and gratitude, which are important in a relationship.\n"
