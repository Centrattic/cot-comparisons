I usually lurk here, but this Saturday something happened and I really need to know who is right in this situation, as my boyfriend (together 4 years, living together) claims he did nothing wrong and that I\u2019m TA while I think the complete opposite.\n\n\nSo, our toilet clogged, after he had some mild stomach problems. At first, it wasn\u2019t too bad, but by Friday night it wasn\u2019t flushing at all. I tried to unclog it and nothing worked.\n\nThe next day, we went to buy another sort of tool (an auger) and while buying it, he seemed already quite annoyed, but got a bit better after some hours. We got home, he tried for one hour to unclog it (while I hovered around and tried to help, by watching videos and trying myself a bit), then I tried for 2 more hours while he urged me to give up.\n\nI have to point out that it\u2019s a 40 m2 apartment, no walls other than toilet, so our bed was literally next to the problem, and we don\u2019t have another bathroom. \n\nI was very tired of not having a toilet working and also a pool of shit next to me, so I asked him if I could call my dad so he could help us. He said ok, but that he wouldn\u2019t help if things went wrong (red flag n1).\n\nMy dad arrived and my BF was laying down. My dad greeted him and he kept laying down. My dad started working on the clog and he was laying down.\n\nAfter 3 hours of work (I was actively helping and cleaning the whole time), it was finally over and the clog was gone (we had to remove it to access the problem, and it was all QUITE disgusting), and my dad took a shower and asked for a pair of shorts, as his were dirty of shit... that didn\u2019t go very well with BF, because \u201che came unprepared\u201d,  but relented.\n\nMy dad went home very angry at my boyfriend, as he literally didn\u2019t do anything, and so were I.\n\nMy BF\u2019s reasoning: I should be grateful that he let my dad fix the toilet. That it wasn\u2019t such a big deal or urgent at all. That the best he could do was to do nothing, because he disagreed with the way my dad was fixing it.\n\nI\u2019m completely baffled. To me, when someone does you a favor (as fixing a toilet full of shit), you should be grateful. But apparently I don\u2019t have real world standards according to him. My dad doesn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore, and I can\u2019t blame him actually.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n(Btw, I\u2019m not only looking for validation, because I\u2019d like to know what makes one think like he does and if I\u2019m actually so delusional to expect common curtesy from my BF). \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author's boyfriend didn't help when her dad came to fix the clogged toilet. The boyfriend was lying down while her dad worked for three hours, and then he got upset when her dad asked for clean clothes. The boyfriend's reasoning is that he didn't have to help and that he disagreed with how her dad fixed it. The author feels that her boyfriend should have been grateful and helped more. Her dad is now angry at the boyfriend, and the author is torn between wanting validation and understanding her boyfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The toilet was clogged, and both the author and her boyfriend tried to fix it over days. When her dad came, the boyfriend didn't participate and just lay down. The dad did all the work, which was messy and took three hours. The boyfriend's argument is that he didn't do anything wrong, and he even said he wouldn't help if things went wrong. The author feels he was ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering social norms and common courtesy: when someone helps you, especially in a difficult situation like dealing with a clogged toilet, it's usually expected that you show appreciation and maybe offer help. The boyfriend didn't contribute while her dad was working, which is a big ask when you're a guest or a partner. He also didn't assist in cleaning up or providing necessary items like clean clothes. That seems inconsiderate because the dad was covered in mess and needed those shorts. The boyfriend's comment about not helping if things went wrong might be a red flag as well\u2014it shows he's not supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that he wasn't involved in the fixing process and maybe didn't agree with the method, but even if that's the case, he could have at least shown gratitude or offered to help with the cleanup. His lack of action in a situation where the helper is working hard could be seen as a lack of respect or support for his partner's family.\n\nThe author might be in the right in expecting her boyfriend to be courteous. It's reasonable to expect that when someone helps out in a difficult situation, especially for extended periods and with unpleasant tasks, the person being helped should express gratitude and offer assistance. The boyfriend's behavior here seems dismissive and ungrateful, which could justify the author's frustration and her dad's anger.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's actions (or inaction) were inconsiderate, and the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about it. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
