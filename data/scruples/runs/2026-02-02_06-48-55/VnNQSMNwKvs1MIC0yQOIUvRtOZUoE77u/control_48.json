There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a talent competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author, as a judge, gave the disabled contestant a very low score, leading to controversy and the eventual reversal of the decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The competition's purpose is to judge based on talent and performance. However, the presence of a disability might have influenced the crowd's reaction and other judges. The author scored based on the performance quality, but the audience and others prioritized the emotional aspect of the contestant's situation. \n\nThe author's justification is that the performance was objectively poor. They argue that the scores should reflect the actual talent and skill. However, the disability of the contestant adds a layer of complexity. There's a debate here between merit-based judgment and empathy for the contestant's circumstances.\n\nI should consider if there's a rule or policy in the competition about accommodating disabilities. If there were no such accommodations, then judging strictly on performance might be fair. But if the competition had provisions for disabilities, the author might have failed to adhere to those guidelines, making their approach wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the author's actions. The deserving winner was booed, which is unfair. The author's strict scoring led to a controversial outcome, but forcing a change to give the prize to a less talented contestant might not be right either. The organizers' pressure to reverse the decision could be seen as compromising the integrity of the competition.\n\nThe author's friends say they're not the asshole, just an asshole, implying that their actions were right in intent but socially insensitive. However, the confrontation with the mother and the organizers might show a lack of consideration for the broader context beyond just the performance score.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on their belief in merit, but the situation's complexity, including disability and public perception, makes their approach ethically questionable. They might not be entirely wrong, but their handling of the situation could be seen as lacking sensitivity, leading to a yes (A) answer.\n"
