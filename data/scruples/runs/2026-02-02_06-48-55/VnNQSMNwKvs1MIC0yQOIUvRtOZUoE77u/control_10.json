There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they were a judge in a talent competition where three teenagers were competing. One of them, Ryan, has a disability and uses a wheelchair. The author gave Ryan a very low score (7/100) because they thought his performance was really bad. The other two contestants got much higher scores. But when the winner was announced, the crowd started booing, and Ryan's mom was upset, leading to the author being pressured to retract their score. Eventually, the organizer made the author admit a mistake, which caused the trophy and scholarship to be given to Ryan instead. The author is now feeling conflicted because their friends called them an asshole for being honest, even though they believe they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The competition is supposed to be based on talent, right? But there's a disability involved here. The author's argument is that they judged purely on skill and that Ryan's performance was subpar. However, the other judges and the crowd didn't agree. The crowd and Ryan's mom were cheering him on for his effort and perseverance, which might be part of the intangible qualities that a competition could value beyond just technical skill. \n\nBut then, the author was told to change their judgment. That's a problem because judges should be impartial and not sway their scores based on pressure. However, the author didn't actually change their score; instead, the organizer made them publicly admit a mistake, which led to the winner being changed. The author's initial low score might have been justified in terms of technical ability, but maybe the competition's criteria included other factors like effort, overcoming obstacles, or audience reaction. If the rules didn't specify that only technical skill is evaluated, the author's approach could be seen as overly rigid or out of touch with the event's intended values.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to a deserving winner being stripped of the title, which is unfair. The crowd's reaction indicates that they valued Ryan's effort and the emotional aspect of his performance. The other judges might have considered that, and the author's low score caused a conflict. The fact that Ryan's mom became confrontational and said mean things could be a result of the stress from the situation, but the author's score was the catalyst. \n\nAnother angle is the author's approach to giving a 7/100. Even if Ryan's performance was bad, being overly harsh in scoring might not be necessary, especially if the competition is meant to encourage and uplift participants. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been to acknowledge his effort while being honest about the technical aspects. Plus, the author's justification of \"he didn't deserve the 7 points\" seems extreme. If it's a 1-100 scale, a 7 is still a failing score, which could be demoralizing regardless of the context.\n\nIn terms of disability considerations, the author didn't state that Ryan's disability affected his performance. The author's criticism is based on the quality of the performance, not the disability. But there's a risk of appearing unsympathetic, especially in a scenario where the crowd and other participants and judges are applauding Ryan's perseverance. The author's friends' reaction suggests that their approach was perceived as harsh, even if technically correct.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author follow the competition's criteria correctly? Were they fair in their scoring? Did they consider the purpose of the competition beyond just technical skill? The author might have breached the event's intended spirit by not valuing effort and perseverance, which could be part of the judging criteria, even if not explicitly stated. Therefore, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the broader aspects the competition aimed to highlight, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
