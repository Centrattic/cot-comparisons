There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person judging a talent competition where a disabled contestant was given a very low score by the author, leading to a controversial outcome.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was a music professional and gave a 7/100 to a contestant with a disability. The other judges were surprised by the low score. The crowd and the contestant's mom strongly supported the disabled kid, leading the organizer to force the author to retract their score so the disabled contestant could win. The author was criticized by friends as an \"asshole,\" but they're seeking validation here.\n\nThe main ethical questions here are about fairness, the role of judges, and treatment of individuals with disabilities. The author's argument is that they were being honest and evaluating based on talent. However, the other judges and the public reaction suggest that there was a broader context where the contestant's effort and circumstances were valuing beyond just technical skill.\n\nIn competitions, especially those for young people, the balance between skill and encouragement is important. Judges are expected to be fair and respectful, even when they have to give low scores. The author's low score was so extreme that it caused public backlash and led to a last-minute change. The fact that the author had to be pressured to reverse their decision indicates that their judgment was not just a matter of opinion but possibly overzealous or insensitive.\n\nAdditionally, the situation involving a contestant with a disability adds another layer. While the competition's criteria should be based on merit, there's a risk of unintentional bias or insensitivity. The author's actions might be seen as contributing to a scenario where a vulnerable individual was publicly humiliated, even if the author's intention was to be fair. The public's reaction (cheering during the performance but then for the other contestant when the decision was reversed) shows conflicting values between merit and empathy.\n\nThe author's friends' response that they're not wrong because they did what they thought was right but called an \"asshole\" suggests that while their intent might be seen as honest, their approach was harsh and possibly tactless. The key issue is whether the author's actions were within the bounds of professional and ethical judging standards, considering both the competition's goals and the potential impact on the participants, especially those with disabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's expertise is valid, the way they handled their judgment and the resulting fallout suggests a lack of consideration for the broader context and the emotional impact on the contestant and their family. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not balancing their honest evaluation with the necessary sensitivity and respect for the contestant's situation.\n"
