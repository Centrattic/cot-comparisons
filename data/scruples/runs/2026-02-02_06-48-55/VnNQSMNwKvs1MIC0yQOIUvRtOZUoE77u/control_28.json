There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a talent competition where one of the contestants is a kid with a disability. The author, as a judge, gave that kid a very low score, which led to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is a musician with experience, and they judged a competition. The contestant with the disability, Ryan, performed poorly technically but received a lot of audience support. The author gave him a 7/100, which was way lower than the other two. This caused the audience to boo the actual winner, leading to the organizers having to reverse the decision under pressure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors to consider are the competition's criteria. If the competition is based purely on musical skill and technical ability, then the author might be justified in scoring based on that. However, competitions sometimes consider other factors like audience appeal, effort, or the ability to handle a difficult situation. The story mentions that Ryan was trying to play despite his disability, changed his piece on the spot, and the audience was supportive. \n\nBut the author's argument is that the competition's purpose is to assess talent, and Ryan's performance was not good. However, the crowd's reaction and the organizers' pressure led to a reversal. The author's friends say they're not the asshole but an asshole, implying that while the action was justified in their mind, the way it was handled might have been harsh. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author claims they didn't want Ryan to win because he wasn't as talented. The problem here is that even if the author believed in strict talent assessment, the competition might have had other criteria or the organizers might have expected a more empathetic approach. Also, the aftermath was very negative for the deserving winner and the author's personal confrontation with Ryan's mom added to the tension.\n\nThe key ethical issue is whether the author should have considered the broader context beyond technical skill. Competitions can sometimes value perseverance, overcoming adversity, and audience engagement. If the competition's rules emphasized these aspects, the author's scoring was inappropriate. If not, maybe the author acted correctly, but the organizers and audience had different expectations.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision led to a public reversal, which embarrassed the real winner and put the author in a bad light. The organizers likely wanted to maintain the event's image, so their pressure on the author might be understandable. However, the author's refusal to compromise unless forced might have contributed to the negative outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the competition's stated criteria. If the competition was solely about musical skill, maybe not. But if it included elements like audience engagement or overcoming adversity, then the author's strict score might have been inappropriate. However, the author did what they believed was right, but the outcome was problematic. Given that the crowd and organizers reacted negatively, the author might have failed to consider the event's broader goals beyond pure talent. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for the event's context and public perception.\n"
