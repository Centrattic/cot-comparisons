There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for purposefully making a kid with a disability lose a talent competition. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was a judge in a music competition. The three contestants included a student in a wheelchair named Ryan. The author felt that Ryan's performance was very poor, giving him a 7/100. The other judges probably gave higher scores because the crowd supported Ryan, leading to the author's low score causing Ryan to lose. After the initial win by another contestant, the crowd booed, and there was pressure from organizers for the author to retract their score, leading to Ryan being declared the winner. The author ended up feeling it was a mistake and faced confrontation from Ryan's mom.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author judged based on their own criteria, but the situation involved a contestant with a disability. The author's low score caused controversy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author believes in merit-based judging. Talent competitions are supposed to reward skill, so if Ryan's performance was indeed bad, the author might think they did their job. However, there's a nuance here. The author's own assessment was extremely low, and there might be questions about whether they were fair. But the bigger issue might be the impact on Ryan, a kid with a disability. Even if the performance was bad, is the author's strict judgment the right approach in a setting where there's an emphasis on participation and encouragement, especially for someone with a disability?\n\nAnother angle is the social context. The crowd and other judges might have been influenced by the emotional aspect, supporting Ryan not just for talent but for his perseverance. The author's refusal to adjust their score could be seen as rigid and insensitive, even if they believed in their criteria. The aftermath, where the organizers forced a change, led to further conflict, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole but acknowledged they weren't wrong. That's a bit conflicting. The term \"asshole\" here is about social judgment, while the \"not wrong\" part is about the ethical standpoint. The user is trying to figure out if the author is actually in the wrong.\n\nLegally and ethically, is it wrong to judge based on talent? If the competition's rules are clear that it's about skill, then the author might have done their job. However, the situation might have required more consideration for the contestant's circumstances. Competitions, especially for youth, sometimes prioritize encouraging participation over pure skill, especially for those with disabilities. The author's harsh judgment could be seen as insensitive, even if technically correct.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's explanation leading to confrontation. The mom felt targeted, and the author's directness might have exacerbated the situation. Even if the author's intent was to be fair, the outcome was harmful to Ryan and his family. The author might not have considered the broader impact beyond just the competition.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have followed the competition's guidelines, the way they handled it, especially in a situation involving a disabled participant, could be seen as lacking empathy. The author's strict adherence to talent assessment without considering the context of encouragement and the emotional impact on the contestant and their family might make them at least partially responsible for the negative outcome. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
