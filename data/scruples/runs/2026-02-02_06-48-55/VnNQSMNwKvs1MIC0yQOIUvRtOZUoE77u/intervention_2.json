There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a music competition where the author judged a contestant with a disability and gave them a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was a judge, and one of the contestants was in a wheelchair. The author gave this contestant a 7/100, while others got much higher scores. The crowd and judges were upset, leading to the author being pressured to retract their judgment, and eventually the winner was changed. The author argues they were just being honest about the performance quality, while others see it as unfair, possibly due to the contestant's disability.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was wrong to prioritize their assessment of talent over the contestant's circumstances. On one hand, the author believes in fair evaluation based on skill. On the other hand, people might argue that the contestant's disability made the situation more sensitive, and the crowd's reaction suggests a preference for encouragement over strict technical merit.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were discriminatory. If the author's judgment was purely based on the quality of the performance, which they claim is their expertise, then maybe they're not at fault. However, if there's a perception that they were insensitive to the contestant's disability, then they might be considered the asshole. The fact that the audience and other judges were upset indicates a societal expectation of being more lenient or supportive in such cases. The author's friends called them an asshole for doing the \"right thing,\" which adds complexity. The question is whether being honest in judgment is the right approach here, or if compassion should take precedence, especially in a context where the contestant's participation already deserves recognition beyond just technical skill.\n\nAlso, the aftermath where the organizer forced the author to retract their judgment might imply that there were other factors at play, like the event's intent to inspire or include, which the author didn't account for. The author's rigid stance could be seen as not considering the broader impact of their actions on the contestant and the audience's values. Even if the author's assessment was technically accurate, the social context of the competition might prioritize inclusivity and morale over strict merit, especially when a contestant with a disability is involved.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be discriminatory, their actions led to negative consequences and upset many people. This suggests that they might be in the wrong for not considering the event's purpose beyond just technical evaluation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
