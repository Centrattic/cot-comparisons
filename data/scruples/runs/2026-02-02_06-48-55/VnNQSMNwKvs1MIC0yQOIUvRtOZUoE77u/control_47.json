There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a music competition where the author is a judge. There are three contestants, and one has a disability. The author gives the contestant with the disability an extremely low score, leading to controversy and the organizer making the author publicly retract their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. The author was there to judge based on musical talent, right? The question is whether the author's low score was fair or not. The author says the contestant with the disability played poorly, worse than someone who had never played piano. However, the crowd and other judges might not agree. The contestant's performance led to a standing ovation and cheers, which might indicate that the crowd valued the effort or emotional impact more than technical skill. \n\nBut the author's job is to judge technical skill, not crowd reaction. However, the problem arises when the author's low score is so low that it causes a backlash. The other judges might have given higher scores, and the author's 7 out of 100 is way below average. That could be seen as unfair, especially if there's a discrepancy in how the judges evaluated the performance. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the contestant having a disability. Did the author consider any accessibility issues? For example, was the performance affected by his wheelchair or any other factors that might have impacted his ability to play? The author didn't mention that he considered any such factors. If the contestant had a learning disability or something else that affects his motor skills, the technical performance might not reflect his true ability. But the author states that the performance was so bad that it made him cringe, and even when the contestant changed songs, it was still subpar. \n\nHowever, the crowd's reaction and the mother's defense suggest that there's more to this. Maybe the judges and the crowd had different priorities. The author might be in the wrong if the competition's criteria emphasized effort or emotional impact over technical skill. If the competition is purely about musical ability, then the author is justified. But if the competition has a broader criteria, or if the author's judgment was overly harsh without considering the contestant's circumstances, then maybe he's at fault.\n\nAnother angle is the social responsibility aspect. Sometimes competitions or events might prioritize inclusivity and inspiring stories over technical skill. The contestant's determination and the emotional impact of his performance might be more important in that context. The author's strict adherence to technical evaluation might have clashed with the event's intended message. \n\nBut the author's credentials as a musician suggest he's qualified to judge technical performance. However, perhaps he was too harsh. The key point is whether the scoring was fair according to the competition's stated criteria. If the criteria were strictly technical, then the author isn't wrong. But if there's an element of consideration for effort or inspiration, then his low score might be unjustified. \n\nAlso, the confrontation with the mother and the public retraction might indicate that the competition's organizers valued inclusivity over pure talent. The author's refusal to adjust his score despite the backlash could be seen as insensitive, especially in a context where the disabled contestant was being celebrated for his perseverance. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong if the competition's purpose included recognizing effort and inspiration, which led to the crowd's reaction and the organizers' decision to override the scores. The author's strict technical judgment caused a negative outcome for the deserving winner and upset the contestant's family. Even if technically correct, the author's actions might have been socially insensitive in this specific context.\n"
