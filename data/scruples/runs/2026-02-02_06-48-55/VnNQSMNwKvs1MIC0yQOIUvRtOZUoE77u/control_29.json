There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a talent competition judged by the author and two others. There are three contestants, one of whom has a disability and uses a wheelchair. The author gives that contestant a very low score, leading to a backlash from the audience and the contestant's mother. The author ends up apologizing and the decision is reversed, making the disabled kid the winner even though the author thought it wasn't fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the competition is based purely on talent and skill, then the author's assessment might be justified. The story mentions that the author has a background in music, so their expertise could be valid. However, the key issue here is whether the author should have considered other factors beyond technical skill, like the emotional impact or the contestant's circumstances.\n\nThe contestant with the disability made a mistake during his performance, changed songs, and received a lot of audience support. The author's low score might be correct in terms of technical evaluation, but the crowd's reaction and the mother's confrontation suggest that there's more at play. The organizer made the author apologize and change the result, which implies that the competition might have had an element of promoting perseverance or inclusion, not just raw talent. If that's the case, the author's strict adherence to technical merit might have overlooked the competition's broader goals.\n\nAlso, the author's friends said they were right in doing what they thought was right but called them an asshole. The author might be in a dilemma between their professional judgment and the social expectations of the event. The fact that the other judges didn't want to get involved might indicate that the author was an outlier in their strict scoring, but it's unclear if the judges had conflicting criteria.\n\nThe disabled contestant's mother and the crowd's reaction highlight the societal tendency to value effort and persistence, especially in someone with a disability. The author's refusal to acknowledge these aspects could be seen as insensitive, even if the technical evaluation was accurate. There's a difference between judging a competition on skill versus on inspirational value. The author might have assumed the competition was strictly for skill, but if the organizers or sponsors had a different intent\u2014like promoting inclusivity\u2014then the author's judgment might not align with the event's purpose.\n\nMoreover, the author's actions led to a situation where the deserving winner was booed, which is a significant outcome. The author's explanation that they didn't think the disabled contestant deserved to win might be correct in a purely musical context, but the aftermath shows that their approach caused emotional distress and conflict. The mother's aggressive reaction and the author's subsequent apology suggest that there was a misunderstanding about the competition's criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely wrong if the competition was indeed about musical skill, but they failed to consider the event's possible emphasis on inspiration and participation, especially given the contestant's circumstances. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not aligning with the intended values of the competition, even if their technical assessment was accurate.\n"
