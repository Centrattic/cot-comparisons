There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves judging a talent competition where a contestant with a disability is involved.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, which led to crowd backlash and the organizers forcing them to reverse the decision. The author's friends called them an asshole but said they weren't wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects of judging. Competitions are supposed to be based on merit, right? The author's argument is that they judged based on performance. However, the contestant with a disability performed poorly and then changed pieces when he messed up. The audience and other judges might have been cheering for the underdog, but the author's score was extremely low, a 7 out of 100. That's pretty harsh, even if the performance was bad. \n\nBut here's the catch: the competition's purpose. If it's a talent show, the main goal is to reward skill, not just sympathy. The author has a valid point in that they're supposed to judge based on the performance. However, the way they handled it might have been insensitive. The contestant had a disability, and maybe the judges should have considered if there were any accommodations needed. But the story mentions the performance was terrible, so maybe the judge wasn't wrong in scoring low.\n\nOn the other hand, the crowd and audience reaction were negative towards the high-achieving student. That could indicate that the community values effort and perseverance over pure skill, which might be different from the author's perspective. However, the author's role is to judge based on criteria, not audience opinion.\n\nThe problem might be that the author didn't communicate their reasoning effectively. The organizer forced them to change the result, leading to the deserving winner being stripped of their title. The author's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole, which suggests a conflict between being technically correct and social perception.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the competition's rules are clear that it's based on skill, then the author did their job. But if the competition is also about providing opportunities for people with disabilities, maybe the author's strict scoring overlooked that. However, the story states that the organizer and the other judges didn't agree with the low score, which might imply that the author's judgment wasn't in line with the competition's values or expectations. \n\nAlso, the way the author interacted with Ryan's mom was confrontational. Even if the author believed they were right, the situation escalated because of the author's actions. The author's friends called them an asshole, which points to social unacceptability even if ethically there's a gray area.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be wrong in terms of the competition's criteria but is in the wrong socially because of the harshness and the resulting fallout. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the competition's goals included supporting people with disabilities regardless of performance. If not, the author is not wrong. If yes, then they are.\n\nBut the competition was sponsored by a music school, so it's likely merit-based. The author acted according to their interpretation of the rules. However, the social context and the organizers' reaction suggest that there was an expectation to consider factors beyond pure skill. The author didn't consider the broader impact of their decision on the contestant and the audience's values. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the event's social aspects and the potential message it sends to the audience and participants.\n"
