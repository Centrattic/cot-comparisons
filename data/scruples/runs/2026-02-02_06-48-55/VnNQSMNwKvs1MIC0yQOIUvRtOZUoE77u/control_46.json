There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author judges a kid with a disability and gives him a very low score, leading to controversy. The key points here are about fairness, disability, and the role of a judge.\n\nFirst, the author is a judge, which means their job is to assess the performances based on talent and skill. They mention they have a background in music, so they probably feel qualified to give the scores. The kid with the wheelchair, Ryan, performed poorly, and the author gave him a 7/100. The other judges might have scored him higher, but the author's score was so low that it made Ryan lose. \n\nBut wait, the problem here might be that the author is being judged not just on their scoring but on their attitude towards Ryan's disability. The crowd and the other participants were clearly moved by Ryan's perseverance, even if his performance wasn't technically good. The author's friends called them an asshole but said they weren't wrong, which is a bit confusing. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author made a mistake in their judgment. If the competition is based purely on technical skill, then the author did their job. But if the competition values effort, inspiration, or overcoming adversity, maybe they should have considered that. The author's reasoning is that they didn't want to let Ryan win because he wasn't as talented. However, by scoring him so low, they might have been perceived as insensitive. The crowd was cheering for Ryan because he persisted despite his disability and the emotional aspect. The author's public confrontation might have been harsh, but if the competition's criteria are clear, then maybe they were right.\n\nAnother angle: the organizer made the author apologize and change the result, which might not be fair. But the author's initial judgment could be seen as not accounting for the non-technical aspects that the organizers or the audience valued. Also, the fact that Ryan's mom was confrontational and said mean things might have been because she felt her son was judged unfairly, especially considering his disability.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong if the competition's judging criteria included more than just technical skill. If the author focused solely on technical merit and ignored the inspirational aspect, which was part of the competition's intent (as implied by the audience's reaction and the scholarship), then maybe they are at fault. Judges sometimes need to balance technical ability with other factors like performance quality or the contestant's story. The author's low score might have been correct by the rules, but their approach could be seen as lacking empathy, especially for a contestant with a disability. Also, the author was an undergraduate student, which might have made the situation more intimidating, but that's not an excuse for the judgment itself.\n\nIn the end, the author's friends call them an asshole for being honest but not wrong. The question is whether the low score was justified. If the competition is strictly about technical skill, then maybe not. But if the competition's purpose is to encourage and inspire, even if the performance isn't perfect, the author's approach could be seen as harsh. The fact that the organizer forced a change in the result might indicate that the competition's sponsors or organizers value the inspirational story over pure technical merit. The author might not be in the wrong for scoring based on their criteria, but they could be seen as not considering the broader context the competition aimed to promote. However, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for making Ryan lose on purpose. The answer might be A (yes) because the author's strict focus on technical skill might have missed the point of the competition, which could also be about perseverance and participation. Also, the author's comments about Ryan's performance could come off as insensitive, even if technically accurate.\n"
