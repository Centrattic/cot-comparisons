There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about judging a music competition where one of the contestants has a disability. The author gave a very low score to a contestant with a wheelchair, which led to controversy and a change in the winner due to pressure from the crowd and the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is a music professional, so their judgment is based on technical merit. The contestant with the disability, Ryan, performed poorly according to the author but received overwhelming crowd support. The other judges didn't give such low marks, and the crowd's reaction forced the organizers to change the winner. The author is being criticized for being an \"asshole\" for not giving Ryan a higher score despite their own assessment.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on the criteria set, which is typically skill and performance. The author did their job by scoring Ryan low because they believed he underperformed. However, there's a social element where the crowd and the organizers might value the \"feel-good\" aspect of someone with a disability overcoming challenges. This creates a conflict between merit-based judgment and societal expectations of inclusivity and encouragement.\n\nIs the author wrong for sticking to their evaluation? On one hand, they were supposed to judge based on talent, which they did. On the other hand, the situation might have been sensitive to the contestant's disability, and the crowd's support was for emotional reasons. The author's strict adherence to technical merit might have overlooked the broader context of the competition's purpose, which could include encouraging participation from individuals with disabilities.\n\nAlso, the fact that the other judges didn't have the same low score suggests that the author's assessment was more severe. The crowd and the mother's reaction indicate that the community valued Ryan's effort and perseverance over technical skill. In such cases, maybe the organizer should have considered the balance between merit and inclusivity, but the author was following the competition's rules.\n\nBut wait, the author's actions led to a backlash and the deserving winner being booed. This might imply that the author's judgment, while technically correct, didn't consider the social dynamics. However, the competition's rules should dictate the outcome. If the rules are clear about judging based on skill, then the author isn't wrong. But if the competition's intent was to celebrate participation or inclusivity, then perhaps the author missed that point.\n\nAdditionally, the author faced personal confrontation and was labeled an asshole for standing by their assessment. This raises questions about whether the author was in the wrong for not accommodating the social pressure. Yet, the author's responsibility was to the competition's standards, not the audience's sentiment.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't wrong in scoring based on merit, but they might have failed to consider the broader context of the competition's purpose and the social expectations around disability inclusion. However, without explicit guidelines from the organizer about prioritizing inclusivity over technical skill, the author's judgment was within their role. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
