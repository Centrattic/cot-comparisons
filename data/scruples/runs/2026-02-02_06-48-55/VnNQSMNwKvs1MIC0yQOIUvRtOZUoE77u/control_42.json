There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a music competition where the author was a judge. There were three contestants, one of whom had a disability and used a wheelchair. The author gave that contestant a very low score, but the audience and other judges didn't, leading to the author's score being the only one that made the contestant lose. Then, due to the backlash, they had to change the winner. \n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they judged based on talent. They mention they have experience in music, so they believe their assessment was valid. The contestant with the disability performed poorly, and the author thought he didn't deserve to win. However, the audience and others were cheering him, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, judging based on merit and skill seems fair. The author was fulfilling their role as a judge. But on the other hand, there's the aspect of being insensitive to the contestant's disability. Even if the performance wasn't great, maybe there's an expectation of being more supportive or accommodating. The author's low score might be seen as contributing to a harsh reaction, especially when the contestant was struggling emotionally. \n\nAlso, the mom's reaction and the crowd's behavior suggest that there was a lot of pressure on the author. The crowd was booing the more talented contestant and cheering the one who didn't perform well. This might indicate that the competition wasn't just about skill but also about sympathy. The author's decision to stick to their judgment despite the backlash shows they prioritized fairness, but others might argue that they missed the point of the competition's purpose, which might be to encourage or recognize effort, especially in someone with a disability.\n\nAnother angle is the author's explanation. When confronted, they defended their decision based on talent, which the mom found offensive. The author's friends said they were right but being an \"asshole,\" meaning they did the right thing but handled it poorly. But maybe the problem is that the author didn't consider the broader context\u2014perhaps the competition was meant to celebrate perseverance, not just raw talent. \n\nIn such cases, judges might be expected to balance technical skill with other factors, like effort or overcoming challenges. The author's strict adherence to talent alone might have been the issue here. Also, the fact that the contestant's mom and others were so invested in their child winning due to his disability could indicate that the event was intended as a platform for such individuals, not just a purely competitive event.\n\nSo, while the author's judgment was based on their expertise, they might have failed to consider the event's purpose and the emotional impact of their decision. Their refusal to adjust their score despite the situation might be seen as inconsiderate, even if technically correct. The aftermath, where the winner had to be changed, caused more distress, which could be on the author's shoulders for not foreseeing that outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the broader context of the competition and the expectations of the audience and organizers, which included supporting a contestant with a disability. While their technical judgment was fair, the lack of sensitivity to the event's purpose and the participants' circumstances could make them the asshole here.\n"
