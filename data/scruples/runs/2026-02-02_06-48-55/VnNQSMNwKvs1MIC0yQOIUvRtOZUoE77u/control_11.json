There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The story is about a judge who gave a low score to a disabled contestant, leading to controversy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was a judge in a talent competition. One of the contestants is in a wheelchair, and the author felt he performed poorly. The other judges probably gave higher scores, leading to the author's low score causing the contestant to lose. The crowd and the mother were upset, and the author was pressured to retract their judgment.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to prioritize their opinion over the crowd's reaction and the contestant's circumstances. The author believes they were fair, but others see them as an \"asshole\" for not considering the emotional aspect.\n\nI should think about the principles of judging. Judges are supposed to assess based on skill and performance, regardless of personal circumstances. The author did that, but the problem might be that the contestant's disability made his performance less technically proficient, but the competition's rules don't mention accommodating disabilities. However, the contestant changed his piece mid-performance, which might have affected the score.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of empathy. Even if the author is technically correct in the scoring, the situation might have required more consideration of the contestant's challenges. The crowd's reaction and the mother's defense suggest that people valued effort and perseverance over technical skill in this case. \n\nHowever, the competition's purpose is to evaluate talent, so the author's role is to judge based on that. But the author's actions led to a backlash, and they were pressured to change the result, which might indicate that the author was within their rights but perhaps didn't consider the broader context of the event's impact on the participants and audience.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the rules are clear that the competition is based on skill, then the author isn't wrong. But if the competition's intent is to celebrate effort and inclusion, then maybe the author's strict scoring was inappropriate. \n\nThe story also mentions the contestant's performance was terrible, but changing the piece mid-way could be a factor. The author's score was low, but other judges might have been more lenient. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions might not be morally wrong if they followed the competition's criteria, but they could be seen as insensitive. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which could depend on whether the competition's goals were solely about talent or not. Since the author was a professional, their judgment is valid, but the situation's emotional impact might make them the antagonist in others' eyes. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because despite their expertise, the way they handled it caused harm and didn't consider the event's broader purpose of encouraging participation and celebrating effort, especially for someone with a disability.\n"
