There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a talent competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author was a judge and gave a very low score to the kid with the disability, which led to a lot of backlash. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a professional musician with experience, so their judgment is based on talent. The kid with a disability, Ryan, performed poorly according to the author, but the audience and others were cheering him for his effort. The author gave Ryan a 7/100, which the other judges probably didn't expect. The result was that the deserving winner was booed, and the author had to publicly retract their judgment under pressure, leading to a controversial outcome where Ryan won despite not having the talent.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The competition's purpose is to judge talent, so if the author's criteria were strictly based on performance, they might not be in the wrong. However, there's a societal aspect where people with disabilities are often celebrated for effort rather than skill, which could lead to perceptions of unfairness. The author's decision might be seen as upholding standards, but it also risks being perceived as insensitive to the broader message of inclusion and encouragement for people with disabilities.\n\nAnother angle: the author's public retraction. Even if they believed in their initial judgment, backing down under pressure might indicate that they acknowledged the social dynamics at play. The confrontation with Ryan's mom and her aggressive response could also suggest that the author's action touched on sensitive issues of disability and fairness.\n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, possibly because of the impact on the contestant with a disability and the social implications. But others might argue that the author did their duty as a judge. However, the key here is whether the author's action was objectively wrong, considering both the competition's goals and the social context of disability support.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent might have been to be fair based on talent, the situation's outcome and the social implications suggest that their action could be seen as contributing to a harsh judgment on a vulnerable group. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the broader context of encouraging participation and celebrating effort, especially in a setting where inclusivity is important.\n"
