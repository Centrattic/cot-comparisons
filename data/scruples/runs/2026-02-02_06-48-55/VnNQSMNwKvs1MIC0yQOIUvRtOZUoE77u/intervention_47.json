There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. The author's main argument is that the kid wasn't talented and didn't deserve to win, but the audience and others were cheering for the kid, and the author ended up causing a lot of conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points here are the author's actions as a judge. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on skill, right? But the author gave a very low score to Ryan, who is in a wheelchair. The other judges didn't do the same, and the crowd was on Ryan's side. \n\nThe author's friends say they're an asshole but not the asshole in the situation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author acted wrongly. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author have a right to judge based on skill alone? But maybe the author's harsh judgment, especially in a context where there's a vulnerable participant, could be seen as insensitive. Also, the author's comment that Ryan didn't even deserve the 7 points might imply that the author was being overly harsh, possibly even discriminatory. \n\nAnother point is that the competition had a scholarship and prize, so the author's decision affected Ryan's access to that opportunity. Even if the author believed in strict meritocracy, the outcome could be seen as unfair, particularly if the competition wasn't solely about technical skill but also about inspiration or other factors. \n\nThe crowd's reaction and the organizer's intervention suggest that the environment expected something different. The author's refusal to comply with the organizer's request to retract their judgment might have caused further harm. \n\nBut also, the author's own experience as a musician might make them feel that their judgment is valid. However, the other judges didn't agree, which raises the question of whether the author was too rigid in their assessment. \n\nThe fact that Ryan's performance was inspiring but technically poor is a key factor. Competitions can sometimes be judged on both technical skill and overall impact. If the competition's criteria emphasized technical skill, the author's judgment might be justified. However, if the event was meant to celebrate participation and effort, the author's strict scoring could be seen as missing the point. \n\nAdditionally, the aftermath where the author had to publicly retract their decision and the resulting confrontation with Ryan's mother might indicate that the author's approach was not considerate of the emotional aspects of the situation. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author acted based on their assessment of technical skill, but perhaps failed to consider the broader context and the potential impact on a participant with a disability. There might be an implicit bias here, where the author's standards were too rigid, or perhaps a misunderstanding of the competition's purpose. The author's harshness led to negative consequences, including embarrassment for the deserving winner and conflict with the family. \n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention was to be fair based on skill, their approach might be considered inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
