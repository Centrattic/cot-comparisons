There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is a judge in a talent competition. One of the contestants is a kid with a wheelchair, who plays an OC piece badly and then switches to a song. The author gives him a very low score, which leads to controversy. The crowd boos the actual talented winner and cheers for the less-talented but disabled kid. The author is then pressured to reverse the judgment, which they do, but they feel wronged because they think they were right to score based on talent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Was the author wrong to judge based on performance? The competition is supposed to be based on talent, so scoring someone lower because they didn't play well seems fair. But there's also the aspect of the disabled contestant. Did the author consider the intention of the competition? Maybe the competition wasn't just about musical excellence but also about inclusion or inspiring others. The crowd's reaction suggests that people valued perseverance over technical skill here. \n\nThe author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole. That's interesting because it points to a conflict between doing what's right (judging fairly) and being socially considerate. The author might have been in a situation where the organizers or the public expected a certain outcome for the disabled contestant, regardless of performance. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior in the confrontation might have been harsh. The mom's reaction could have been exacerbated by the author's blunt honesty. But the author was just stating their opinion honestly. However, in such settings, judges might need to balance honesty with sensitivity, especially when there's an element of public perception or the intent of the event.\n\nThe competition's sponsors and organizers might have had different priorities, like promoting inclusivity. If that's the case, the author's strict adherence to technical scoring could conflict with the event's goals. But the author wasn't told about these expectations beforehand. \n\nSo, the question is whether being honest about judging based on talent is wrong in this context. If the competition's stated criteria are based on technical skill, then the author isn't wrong. However, if the competition's underlying purpose was to highlight perseverance and inclusion, then the author might be undermining that purpose. \n\nBut the author did follow the scoring guidelines as they understood them. The problem might be that the other judges and the organizers had different expectations, leading to conflict. The author's mistake could be not clarifying the judging criteria beforehand. \n\nIn terms of ethics, should one prioritize technical merit or the broader message of the event? The author did what they believed was right, but the fallout suggests that they didn't account for the social dynamics. Maybe they were in the right in terms of the competition's rules but in the wrong in terms of the social implications. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the competition was purely about talent or had other objectives. Since the author wasn't informed of the latter, they might not be at fault. However, considering the public's reaction and the organizers' need to maintain a positive image, the author's approach could be seen as socially insensitive. Hence, they might be in the wrong for not considering the event's broader context.\n"
