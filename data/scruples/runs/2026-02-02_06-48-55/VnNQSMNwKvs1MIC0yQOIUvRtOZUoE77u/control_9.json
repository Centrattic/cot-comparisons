There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author is a judge. There are three contestants: one with a disability who performed poorly but got a lot of audience support, and two others who performed better. The author gave the disabled contestant a very low score, leading to the crowd's backlash. The organizer forced the author to reverse the decision, making the disabled contestant the winner, which the author then had to publicly admit was a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions and their justification. The author believes that the competition should be based on merit, so the best performance should win. However, the audience and the organizers prioritized the inspirational story of the disabled contestant over technical skill. The author's strict adherence to their personal standards led to conflict and the overriding of their decision by the organizers.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is a professional judge with experience, so they have a right to evaluate based on technical expertise. On the other hand, the competition might have had other criteria, like crowd appeal or the spirit of the event, which the author might not have considered. The author didn't follow the crowd's sentiment, which caused a negative reaction. But was it wrong to stick to their honest assessment?\n\nThen there's the aspect of the disabled contestant. The author's low score could be seen as insensitive, especially if the competition values participation and overcoming challenges. However, the author isn't wrong for having an opinion on technical skill. The problem might be that the author didn't account for the event's possible broader goals beyond just technical merit. \n\nAlso, when the organizer asked the author to reverse the decision, the author complied, which might show some regret or realization that the situation required more than just technical evaluation. The fact that the author felt bad and went along with the change suggests they might have recognized an ethical issue with their initial judgment in that context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They acted according to their judgment but ignored the possible purpose of the event. Competitions can sometimes have hidden criteria like inclusivity or audience engagement. The author's strict technical evaluation might not align with the event's goal to celebrate perseverance. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering these factors and causing harm to the contestant and the event's atmosphere.\n\nBut another angle is that judges are supposed to assess based on the given criteria. If the rules were purely technical, the author did their job. The problem is the organizers and audience didn't agree with that. However, the author might have failed to communicate their reasoning effectively, leading to conflict. The author's blunt assessment without considering the event's context could be the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on their expertise, but neglecting the event's potential emphasis on inspiration over skill makes them at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
