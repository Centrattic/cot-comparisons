There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe user is a judge at a talent competition with three contestants. One of them is in a wheelchair, named Ryan. The author feels Ryan's performance was terrible\u2014so bad that he gave him a 7/100. The other two scores were much higher. But when the results were announced, the crowd boos because the deserving winner (the first guy) didn't win. The crowd cheers for Ryan even though his performance was bad. The organizer forces the author to publicly retract his judgment, leading to Ryan winning. The author had to take back the title from the first guy. Then Ryan's mom confronts the author, leading to a tense situation.\n\nThe author argues they did what they thought was right based on talent, but others say they're an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is a professional musician and judge, so they might believe in evaluating talent objectively. But Ryan has a disability, and the crowd is cheering for him, possibly because he's seen as an underdog. The author's harsh judgment could be seen as insensitive to the broader context of what the competition values\u2014maybe perseverance over pure skill? Or maybe the competition wasn't set up to accommodate Ryan's abilities, leading to a poor performance. The author might not have considered that the competition's structure or Ryan's disability made it harder for him to perform at a higher level, even if he practiced. \n\nAlso, the crowd's reaction suggests that the community values effort and courage as much as talent. The author's strict scoring might have ignored those values, leading to public backlash. Additionally, the organizer's request to reverse the decision implies that the competition might prioritize inclusivity or public sentiment over technical skill in this context. \n\nThe author's actions caused the deserving winner to be upset and the crowd to boo, which could be seen as a failure to respect the event's purpose. Even if the author acted on their belief in technical merit, enforcing that in a setting where other values are at play could be inappropriate. The author's refusal to compromise and the resulting confrontation with Ryan's mother show a lack of empathy and consideration for the emotional impact of their decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that their role as a judge is to assess skill, and they did their duty honestly. However, the incident shows that their strict adherence to technical criteria caused harm to another competitor and their family. The key issue is whether the competition's criteria included considering elements beyond technical skill, like perseverance or participation. If not, the author might not be wrong. But if they failed to consider the context or the event's intended values, they might be in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's judgment was based on technical skill but didn't account for the event's possible emphasis on inclusivity and the audience's values. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering these factors and causing unnecessary harm.\n"
