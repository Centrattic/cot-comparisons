There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nThey were a judge in a talent competition for teenagers. There were three contestants left. One was in a wheelchair named Ryan. The author is a music professional and gave Ryan a 7 out of 100, while the others got much higher. The crowd and other judges were upset, leading to Ryan winning after the organizer pressured the author to change the result. The author felt Ryan wasn't talented enough, but others felt bad about him losing because of his disability and the emotional situation. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and judging based on merit versus empathy. The author's argument is that they judged based on musical skill, which they have the expertise for. However, the other judges and crowd valued Ryan's effort and the emotional impact of his performance, possibly because of his disability. \n\nThe author is being criticized for being an \"asshole\" for sticking to their judgment despite the backlash. But is that fair? Judges are supposed to assess based on talent. However, the situation might have been more nuanced. Was Ryan's performance so bad that it was unfair to give him any points? The author gave him 7 out of 100, which is very low. But in a competition, the scores should reflect the actual performance, not just the emotional aspect.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the audience and judges reacting to Ryan's situation. The crowd cheered for him after he struggled, and the other judges were shocked by the low score. This might suggest that the author didn't consider the context enough. Maybe the competition wasn't purely about musical excellence but also about inspiring the audience. But the author's role is to judge based on skill, not popularity. \n\nThe other judges and organizers might have felt the author was being insensitive by downgrading Ryan's performance so harshly. But if the author's job was to select the most talented, then they did their job. However, the way the situation unfolded caused a lot of distress, and the author might have been too rigid in their assessment without considering the broader impact. \n\nThere's also the part where the author had to publicly retract their decision, which might have been unnecessary if they had communicated their reasoning better. The conflict with Ryan's mom and the confrontation could have been avoided with more empathy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did what they believed was right for the competition, but maybe they didn't account for the emotional and social aspects enough. Judges should be fair and consistent, but in a case where the audience and other judges value different things, the author might have been too harsh. However, they did follow their expertise. \n\nOn the other hand, if the competition's criteria were strictly based on musical skill, then the author was correct. But if the event also aimed to inspire or recognize perseverance, then the other judges and audience were right. The problem is the author's rigid stance without considering the event's possible goals beyond pure musical talent. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't balance their professional judgment with the broader context of the event, leading to unnecessary conflict and distress. Their harsh score and refusal to adjust caused problems, and they might have been too insensitive to the situation involving a disabled participant.\n"
