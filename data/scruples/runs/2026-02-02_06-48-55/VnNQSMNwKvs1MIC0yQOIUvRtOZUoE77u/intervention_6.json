There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a music competition where one of the participants is a kid with a disability using a wheelchair. The author, who is a judge, gave this kid a very low score, leading to controversy and the eventual decision to change the winner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the competition. The rules state that the winner is determined by the judges' scores. The author based their judgment purely on the performance merit, as a music professional. However, the audience and other judges didn't agree, leading to a backlash. The key question is whether the author's judgment was fair or if they were wrong to prioritize technical skill over the inspirational aspect of the performance.\n\nThe kid with a disability performed poorly but received a lot of audience support for perseverance. The author's low score might be seen as objective, but the outcome caused emotional distress to the participant and their family. The author was pressured to reverse their decision, which they did, but the situation escalated with confrontation and accusations.\n\nLegally and ethically, competitions are supposed to be judged based on the criteria set, which here is musical talent. The author followed their interpretation of the criteria, but the social dynamics and the impact on the participant's feelings complicate things. The fact that the other judges didn't share the same low score suggests there might be subjectivity in judging. However, the author's decision wasn't based on bias against the disability but on the performance quality. \n\nBut the aftermath shows that the author's strict adherence to technical merit caused harm. The organizer forced the author to change their decision, which might indicate that the competition's sponsors or organizers had different priorities, like promoting an inspirational story over pure talent. The author's initial judgment might have been correct in terms of skill, but the situation highlights a conflict between objective standards and the compassionate, social value of recognizing effort and perseverance.\n\nIn the end, the author did change the result, which might have been the right thing to do to prevent further conflict, but the original judgment was based on their expertise. The problem is whether the author is in the wrong for making that initial judgment. Since the competition's rules didn't mention considering inspiration over talent, the author's stance might be defensible. However, the emotional impact on the family and the audience suggests that there's more to consider than just technical skill. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a judgment based on their expertise, but they might be wrong in not anticipating the social implications of their decision. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for the initial action. Since the judges are supposed to assess talent, the author's action is within their role. The problem arises when the competition's goals include elements beyond talent, which the author might not have considered. Therefore, the answer is a bit nuanced, but the author isn't in the wrong for judging based on talent.\n"
