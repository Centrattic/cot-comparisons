There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author is a judge. One of the contestants is a kid with a disability in a wheelchair. The author gives him a very low score, leading to controversy and the eventual reversal of the results. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. The author was supposed to judge based on talent and performance. If the competition's criteria are strictly about musical ability, then the author's low score might be justified if the performance was indeed poor. However, the other judges didn't share this opinion, which raises questions. Maybe they considered other factors, like the contestant's perseverance or the audience reaction.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author claims they judged based on talent, but the way they describe Ryan's performance\u2014calling it \"atrocious\" and \"worse than someone who never played\"\u2014suggests a harsh assessment. The other judges were shocked by the low score, implying a discrepancy in evaluation. The audience and Ryan's mom were upset, leading the organizer to force the author to retract their judgment. \n\nEven if the author believed they were correct, the situation might have been handled differently. Judging competitions can involve subjective elements, but when there's a conflict between judges, there might be protocols to resolve it, like discussing scores or averaging them. The author's refusal to compromise and the subsequent pressure from the organizer and audience might indicate that their strict adherence to their own judgment was problematic.\n\nAlso, the fact that the competition had an audience and judges, and the winner was determined by scores, suggests that the author's role was to assess skill, not to prioritize other values like perseverance. However, the crowd's reaction and the mom's behavior indicate that people valued effort and inspiration over technical skill. The author's actions might have been technically correct by the competition's rules but socially insensitive, especially considering the contestant's disability.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole but said they weren't wrong, which is confusing. Legally or by competition rules, maybe they weren't wrong, but morally or socially, they might be. The author's comment about the scholarship going to a \"shitty music school\" might imply that the prize's value wasn't as important, but the participants still put in effort. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be wrong in their judgment's intent if following the competition's criteria, but their handling of the situation, especially the refusal to engage with others' perspectives and the resulting harm to the contestant and other participants, could make them at fault. The impact of their actions caused distress and undermined the competition's integrity, so maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong).\n"
