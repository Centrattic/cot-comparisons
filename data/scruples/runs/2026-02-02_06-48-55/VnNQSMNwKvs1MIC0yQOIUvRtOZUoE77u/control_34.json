There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author is a judge. There are three contestants, one of whom is a kid with a disability in a wheelchair. The author gives this kid a very low score, 7 out of 100, because they think he played poorly. The other judges apparently disagreed, and the crowd was on the side of the disabled kid too. The author ends up causing the deserving winner to be booed and then the competition's organizers forced the author to change the result in favor of the disabled kid. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The primary role of a judge is to evaluate based on merit and skill. The author did that, giving scores based on their professional judgment. However, there's also an aspect of considering the context, like the emotional and social impact. The kid with a disability was struggling and the crowd was supporting him for his effort, not just talent. The mother and audience's reaction suggest that winning might have been more about perseverance than skill.\n\nBut is the author wrong for sticking to their professional assessment? On one hand, the author's expertise in music should be respected. They didn't give a low score because of the disability but because of the performance quality. On the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in such competitions to recognize effort and encouragement, especially for participants with challenges. However, competitions are typically about skill, so the author's approach is valid in that sense.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The author was pressured to change their decision, which might indicate that the organizers valued inclusivity and morale over strict merit in this case. But the author's role is to evaluate the performance, not to adjust scores for crowd-pleasing reasons. However, the way the situation escalated could have been handled better. Maybe the author should have discussed the score with the other judges beforehand to avoid the conflict.\n\nAlso, the fact that Ryan switched songs mid-performance and the audience's reaction might have influenced the judges. But the author's job is to assess the performance as it was given. The initial piece was bad, and the switch to a different song (which was also poorly executed) might not count as a skillful performance. The author's low score reflects that.\n\nIn terms of disability considerations, the competition should be accessible, but the author's criticism is about the performance quality, not the disability itself. The author isn't wrong for judging based on skill, but maybe there's an argument that competitions should also recognize effort and participation, especially when there's a disparity in physical abilities. However, that's a different type of award and usually competitions prioritize skill unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe author's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole, which is interesting. It might be that the author did the right thing in terms of judging the competition fairly but came across as insensitive in their interactions, especially with the mother's confrontation. The author might not be in the wrong for the scoring but could have handled the situation more diplomatically.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's scoring was based on their expertise and the performance's quality, the situation's context and the organizers' expectations might mean that they were supposed to consider other factors. However, the core responsibility of a judge is to evaluate the talent, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The conflict arose from differing priorities between merit and emotional support, but the author's actions were within their role as a judge. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
