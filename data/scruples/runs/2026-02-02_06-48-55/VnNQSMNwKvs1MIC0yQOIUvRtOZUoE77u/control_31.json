There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author is a judge. There are three contestants, one of whom is in a wheelchair. The author gives extremely low marks to the disabled contestant, Ryan, which leads to a lot of backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the competition's purpose. The author says they judged based on talent, but the crowd and the other judges might have valued effort or perseverance more, especially since Ryan is disabled. The author mentions that Ryan's performance was terrible, but the crowd cheered for his effort. The author's strict adherence to technical skill might clash with the crowd's emotional support for Ryan.\n\nThen there's the issue of disability. The author's actions might come off as insensitive. Even if Ryan's performance wasn't technically good, his participation and effort might be more important in a competition aimed at encouraging youth, especially those with disabilities. The author might have failed to consider that the competition's organizers intended to highlight perseverance over technical perfection.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the organizer made the author publicly admit they were wrong, leading to the deserving winner losing. This shows that the author's strict scoring had consequences beyond just the competition. The other judges didn't support the author's decision, which suggests that there was an expectation to be more lenient or considerate towards Ryan.\n\nThe key question is whether it's wrong to judge purely on technical skill in this context. If the competition's rules emphasized technical merit, then the author isn't wrong. But if the competition's intent was also to celebrate participation and effort, especially for a contestant with a disability, then the author's approach might be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an asshole for doing the right thing, which adds complexity. However, the author's actions led to a deserving winner being booed and a trophy being reallocated, which likely caused distress. The confrontation with Ryan's mom and the subsequent comments indicate that the author's approach was not well-received socially.\n\nIn summary, while the author might believe they were acting correctly by adhering to technical standards, the situation's context\u2014celebrating a disabled participant's effort and the crowd's reaction\u2014suggests that the author's approach was insensitive and failed to consider broader values of the competition.\n"
