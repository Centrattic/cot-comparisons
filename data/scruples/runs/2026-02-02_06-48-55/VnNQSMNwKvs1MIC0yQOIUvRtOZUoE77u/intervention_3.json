There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a judge at a talent competition giving a low score to a contestant with a disability, leading to a controversial outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author is a music judge who scored a child with a disability a 7/100, which they admitted was harsh. The other judges were shocked, and the crowd booed when the deserving winner was announced. The organizers pressured the author to retract their judgment, leading to the trophy being given to the less-talented contestant. The author's reasoning was based on skill, but the crowd and organizers valued effort and perseverance instead.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between meritocracy (rewarding talent) vs. inclusivity and encouragement for participants with disabilities. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nIn many competitions, especially those with external sponsors, there's an expectation to balance fairness with positive public relations. Even if the author's assessment of talent was accurate, the context of the competition might prioritize participation and encouragement over pure technical skill. Additionally, the organizers might have wanted to avoid making a contestant with a disability feel inadequate in front of an audience. The author's refusal to adjust their judgment could be seen as lacking empathy, especially since the organizers and crowd valued the emotional impact over strict merit. The author's actions led to a negative experience for the winner and created a hostile environment with the contestant's mother.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were maintaining the integrity of the competition by judging solely on skill. However, in events where the goal is to inspire and include participants, especially in youth competitions, the approach might differ. The author's harsh score and subsequent refusal to compromise could be viewed as contributing to a toxic situation, even if their intention wasn't malicious.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions, while based on their professional judgment, failed to consider the broader context and intentions of the competition. They might have been unaware of the organizers' priorities or the emotional aspects involved. The outcome caused distress and conflict, suggesting that the author was in the wrong for not adapting their judgment to the event's goals beyond just technical evaluation.\n"
