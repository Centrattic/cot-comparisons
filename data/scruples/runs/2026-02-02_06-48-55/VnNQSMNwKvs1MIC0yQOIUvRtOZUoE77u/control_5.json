There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a music competition where the author, a judge, gave a low score to a disabled contestant, Ryan, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the rules of the competition. The author was there to judge based on musical talent, right? They claimed Ryan's performance was terrible\u2014so bad that he didn't even deserve the 7/100 they gave. But the crowd and others were cheering for Ryan because he was overcoming his disability, changing pieces, and showing perseverance. The organizers then forced the author to retract their judgment, leading to the win being given to Ryan despite the low scores.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted. They believe they did their job by judging based on talent, but others, including the crowd, the other judges, and the organizers, thought they were being harsh and insensitive. The author's friends said they weren't wrong but just an asshole. But the question is whether they're actually in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are: Did the author adhere to the competition's criteria? If the competition was purely based on musical skill, then the author's scoring might be justified. However, sometimes competitions, especially those involving youth, might also consider effort, perseverance, or the spirit of participation. The problem here is that the author's low score caused a big backlash, and the organizers made them reverse their decision. Also, Ryan's mother's reaction suggests that there was an expectation of leniency or consideration for his disability.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the rules didn't mention considerations for disability, then the author's judgment is based on the criteria. However, sometimes there's an unspoken understanding in such events to encourage participants, especially those with challenges. The author might have failed to consider that, even if the competition was supposed to be about talent. Additionally, the way the author's comments were received led to the deserving winner being booed, which is a negative outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, if the competition is strictly merit-based, the author did their job. But the conflict arises because the organizers and the public expected a different outcome. The author might have not communicated their reasoning effectively or failed to consider the event's context beyond just technical skill. The fact that the other judges didn't want to engage suggests they might have agreed with the author's assessment but didn't want to face the backlash, so the author was the only one held accountable.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they followed the competition's rules. However, the situation might require empathy and understanding the broader purpose of the event, which might include inspiring or supporting participants with disabilities. The author's actions, while technically correct per the rules, caused significant distress and perhaps didn't align with the event's intended message or social values. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the competition's primary goal was to identify the most talented, then the author isn't wrong. But if the event also aimed to encourage and include those with disabilities, then the author's strict adherence to talent alone might be seen as insensitive. The answer might depend on the intended criteria of the competition, which isn't explicitly stated here. However, since the author is being criticized for the harsh reaction and the organizers had to adjust the outcome, there's an argument that they didn't consider the social context, making them at least partially at fault. \n\nBut then again, judges are supposed to be fair and stick to the criteria. If the criteria didn't include factors like perseverance, the author's judgment was correct. The problem might be that the event's organizers didn't set clear expectations, leading to a clash between objective scoring and subjective community values. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for following their understanding of the rules, but the event's setup was flawed. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the organizers. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because, even if they followed the technical criteria, their scoring led to negative consequences and didn't consider the broader context of the event's purpose, which might have been to celebrate participation and effort, especially for a contestant with a disability. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the competition was purely merit-based. But the community's reaction and the organizers' intervention suggest that the author's approach was not aligned with the event's values. So, probably A.\n"
