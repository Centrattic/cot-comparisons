There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a talent competition where they were a judge. There were three contestants, one of whom had a disability and used a wheelchair. The author gave that contestant a very low score, which led to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the competition was purely based on talent and skill, then the author's judgment might be justified. However, if there were any rules about considering effort or other factors, maybe not. The author mentions that the other two judges were surprised by their low score, which suggests that maybe the others didn't rate Ryan that low. So there's a discrepancy in the judging.\n\nRyan's performance was described as really bad, but the crowd and the other judges didn't support the author's decision. The crowd started booing when the original winner was announced, and then cheered again when Ryan got the title. The author's actions led to a change in the outcome, which upset the original winner and the audience. \n\nThe author's friends said they weren't wrong but were an asshole for being honest. That's a clue. The problem here might be about how they handled the situation. Even if the author believed Ryan wasn't talented, maybe they should have considered other factors like the competition's intent or the organizers' goals. Talent shows sometimes aim to celebrate perseverance or inclusion, not just raw skill. \n\nAlso, the author was an undergraduate student dealing with adults, which might have added pressure, but that doesn't excuse the outcome. The organizer made them reverse the decision, which could indicate that the competition wasn't solely about merit from the organizers' perspective. The author's refusal to compromise might have been harsh, especially since the organizers had different priorities.\n\nRyan's mom's reaction could stem from feeling that her son was unfairly judged. Even if the author is right about skill, publicizing that opinion might have been tactless. The author's response to the mom was direct and possibly insensitive. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between fairness and compassion. The author acted on their belief in merit, but didn't consider the broader impact on participants and the message the competition sent. The fact that the other judges didn't share the author's low score suggests maybe the author's standards were too strict or not aligned with the competition's goals. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were technically fair in terms of their own judgment but might have been socially insensitive. The competition might have valued participation or inspiring stories over pure performance quality. The author's refusal to adjust their stance led to a problematic outcome, so they might be at fault for not considering the context or the emotional impact.\n"
