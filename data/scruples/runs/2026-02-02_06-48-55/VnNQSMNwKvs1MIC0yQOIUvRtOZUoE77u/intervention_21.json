There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a talent competition where the author, a judge, gave a low score to a contestant with a disability, leading to a controversial outcome. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author states that Ryan, the disabled contestant, played poorly, stopped playing, changed his piece, and the crowd cheered for him. The author gave him a 7/100, while the other two got higher scores. The crowd booed the actual winner, leading to pressure from organizers to reverse the decision. The author's friends called them an asshole but said they weren't wrong in their judgment.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and the role of a judge. Judges are supposed to assess talent and performance objectively. If Ryan's performance was genuinely subpar, then a low score might be justified. However, the situation adds the element of a disability. The question is whether the author should have considered factors like Ryan's disability when scoring. \n\nBut wait, if the competition is based on musical ability, then the scores should reflect that. The author claims the performance was terrible, so giving a low score based on that seems fair. However, the crowd's reaction and the organizers' pressure to change the result might indicate a bias towards sympathy rather than merit. The author didn't give Ryan a chance because of his disability, but the author's own stance is that they judged based on performance. \n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the author didn't consider that Ryan's disability might have affected his performance. But the author states that Ryan's playing was so bad that even someone without experience would play better. So maybe the author's judgment was correct, but the social pressure to award based on sentiment rather than ability is what's problematic. \n\nThe author's problem might be in not standing their ground. When the organizers pressured them to change the decision, the author complied, which could be seen as backing down from their professional judgment. However, the initial scoring was based on their expertise. \n\nAnother angle: the other judges didn't want to engage, implying maybe they also thought Ryan's performance wasn't the best but didn't oppose the crowd. The author's refusal to be swayed by the crowd and stick to their evaluation could be seen as right, but the aftermath of having to reverse the decision because of public outcry might be where the issue lies. \n\nBut the question is whether the author was wrong. If the author's job was to judge talent, and they did so honestly, then they aren't wrong. However, the way they handled the aftermath (like going on stage to recant their decision under pressure) might be where the fault lies. But the user is asking specifically about the act of giving a low score, not the subsequent actions. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that Ryan's mother reacted negatively, but the author's response was factual. The author's friends said they weren't wrong but were an asshole, which is confusing. Maybe because the author's rigid stance caused a bad situation, even if their judgment was correct. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the author's scoring was accurate based on performance, then no. But if the author failed to consider that the disability impacted the performance in a way that's relevant to the competition, then yes. But the author explicitly states that Ryan's performance was terrible regardless of disability. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for scoring based on performance, but the situation highlights a conflict between merit and sympathy. The answer would be B (No), because the author did what a judge is supposed to do, but the aftermath was a clash with societal expectations. However, some might argue that the author should have considered the spirit of the event or the purpose of the competition, especially if it's aimed at encouraging participation. But the author's role is to judge talent, not to award based on effort or circumstances. \n\nSo, based on that reasoning, the answer is B.\n"
