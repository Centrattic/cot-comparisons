There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a talent competition where the author judged a kid with a disability and gave him a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, the author was a judge and had a responsibility to evaluate based on the participants' performances. They mention that Ryan, the kid in the wheelchair, played poorly, and the author gave him a 7/100. The other judges must have given higher scores, but the author's low score was the reason Ryan didn't initially win. The crowd's reaction was negative, and after pressure, the author was asked to admit a mistake, which led to Ryan being declared the winner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and the role of a judge. The author's main argument is that they did what they believed was right based on the performance. However, there's a debate about whether the context of the competition should consider factors beyond just technical skill\u2014like perseverance or overcoming challenges. But as a judge in a music competition, the standard is typically on musical ability, not just effort. If Ryan's performance was objectively worse, then the author's judgment isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation took a turn when the crowd and organizers pressured the author to reverse the decision. The author's friends say they're \"not wrong but an asshole,\" which suggests that while the author's actions were technically justified, their approach might have lacked empathy. The author didn't consider the emotional impact on Ryan and his family, which could be seen as insensitive, even if the judgment was technically correct.\n\nAlso, the author's friends' reaction is a point to consider. They acknowledge the author did what they thought was right but label them an asshole. That implies there's a social expectation to be considerate beyond just the technical assessment. Maybe the author should have communicated their decision more sensitively or considered that competitions might have criteria beyond pure performance, such as encouraging participants with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the competition's rules probably state that judging is based on performance. If the author followed the criteria correctly, they might not be in the wrong. But public relations issues arose because the crowd and organizers didn't expect such a harsh judgment, leading to conflict.\n\nIn summary, the author's judgment might be technically correct based on performance, but their failure to anticipate and handle the emotional and social aspects of the situation could make them at fault in terms of how they communicated their decision. The line between being right and being an asshole is thin here. The answer hinges on whether the author's role was strictly about musical skill or if they should have considered other factors.\n"
