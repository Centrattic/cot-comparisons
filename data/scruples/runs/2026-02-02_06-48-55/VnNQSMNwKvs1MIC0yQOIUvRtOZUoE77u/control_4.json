There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author judged a kid with a disability and gave him a very low score, which led to controversy. The main points to consider are the fairness of the judgment, the impact on the participants, and the social dynamics involved.\n\nFirst, the author is a professional musician with experience, so they probably have the expertise to evaluate the performances. They scored the disabled kid, Ryan, a 7/100 because his playing was terrible. The other judges might have been more lenient, maybe considering his disability. The crowd and his mom rallied around Ryan, even after he changed his piece and played poorly. The organizer then pressured the author to retract their score, leading to the real winner being stripped of the title.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to give Ryan such a low score. On one hand, the author's assessment was based on the quality of the performance. If the competition is about musical talent, then scoring honestly is important. But on the other hand, there's the consideration of the contestant's circumstances. Ryan's disability might have affected his performance, but that doesn't necessarily mean he should be given a higher score just for participating. However, the fact that the crowd and the other judges were swayed by his situation could imply that the competition wasn't purely merit-based. \n\nThe problem here is whether the author should have adjusted their scoring to align with the expectations of the organizer or the crowd. The author might feel they were right to judge based on skill, but the organizers might have prioritized the feel-good aspect of the event. If the competition is meant to be educational or encouraging, maybe the organizers wanted to reward effort and perseverance, especially in a participant with a disability. However, if the stated criteria of the competition are strictly about talent, then the author's approach is justified.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for bias. The author might have been unfairly harsh because Ryan's performance was emotionally charged. But the author insists that the low score was justified, so it's possible they were accurate in their assessment. The issue is that the other judges didn't agree, and the crowd's reaction suggests that the community values participation and effort over technical skill. \n\nThe author's actions led to a significant backlash, which might indicate that there's a social expectation to be more compassionate, even if it means not giving the highest score to the most technically proficient. The fact that Ryan gave the scholarship back but kept the trophy adds another layer. The author was honest in their assessment, but the situation highlights a conflict between merit and empathy.\n\nUltimately, the author's low score was based on their professional judgment, but the organizers and others expected a different approach. If the competition's rules don't specify that disability should be a factor, then the author's scores are fair. But if the competition's goal is to motivate and encourage, maybe the author should have considered the broader impact. However, the story doesn't mention any rules about adjusting scores for disabilities. So, the author might not be in the wrong for scoring based on the performance, but the way the situation unfolded and the resulting conflict could be seen as a failure to understand the event's purpose.\n"
