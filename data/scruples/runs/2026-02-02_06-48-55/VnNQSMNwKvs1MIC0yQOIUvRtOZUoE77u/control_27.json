There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they were a judge at a music competition, and one of the contestants was a kid with a disability in a wheelchair. The author gave that kid a very low score, which led to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the competition is supposed to be judged purely on musical talent and skill, then the author might be right to give low scores based on performance. The author mentions that the disabled kid played poorly, even changing pieces mid-performance and not playing the melody properly. However, the crowd and other judges might have been influenced by the emotional aspect\u2014supporting someone with a disability who was trying their best, even if the performance wasn't technically good.\n\nBut wait, the author's main job as a judge is to assess talent, not popularity or emotional factors. If the competition is about music ability, then the author's scores were technically accurate. However, there's a social aspect here. The crowd's reaction and the mother's confrontation suggest that the author's strict adherence to technical merit might have overlooked the spirit of the event. Maybe the competition wasn't just about musical excellence but also about encouraging participants, especially those with disabilities. \n\nAlso, the fact that the other judges were shocked by the low score implies that maybe there was an unwritten standard of being more lenient with the disabled contestant. The author's decision to score strictly might have been seen as insensitive, even if technically correct. The aftermath was chaotic, and the organizer had to intervene, which points to the author's judgment affecting the event's atmosphere negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends say they're not wrong because they did what they thought was right. If the competition's rules didn't mention any exceptions for disabilities, then the author was just being honest. But if the event had a different purpose, like promoting inclusivity and participation over pure talent, the author might have failed to understand that.\n\nThe key here is whether the competition was talent-based or had other criteria. If it's purely talent, the author isn't wrong. But if there's an expectation to support participants regardless of skill, then maybe they were. However, the author's explanation to the mother was honest, even if it caused conflict. The problem might be more about the mother's reaction than the author's judgment. \n\nIn the end, the author might have been within their rights as a judge, but the social fallout suggests that their approach was too harsh, not considering the event's broader goals and the emotional dynamics. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not understanding the context beyond technical merit.\n"
