There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they judged a music competition and gave a contestant with a disability a very low score, which led to a lot of backlash. The key points here are the competition's purpose, the scoring fairness, and the impact on everyone involved.\n\nFirst, the competition was a talent show. The main idea of a talent competition is to reward actual talent and skill. The author is a music professional, so their score is based on musical ability. Ryan, the kid in the wheelchair, played poorly and even changed his piece mid-performance. The author gave him a 7/100, which the others found extremely low. The crowd and other judges were shocked, leading to the organizer forcing a change in the outcome.\n\nBut here's the thing: competitions are supposed to be judged based on the participants' performances, not on their circumstances. If Ryan didn't perform well, then the author's job is to score him fairly. However, there's a debate here about whether the crowd's reaction and the emotional aspect should influence the judgment. The crowd was cheering for Ryan despite his poor performance, which might have created pressure on the judges.\n\nOn one hand, the author did what they believed was right\u2014judging based on merit. On the other hand, the situation might have been more about the emotional support for a contestant with a disability. Maybe the competition wasn't just about talent but also about encouraging participation and recognition of effort. But the problem is that the rules didn't mention that. If the rules state that the competition is based on musical skill, then the author is correct in scoring him low. However, if the competition's goal was to be inclusive and celebrate participation, then the author's strict adherence to talent might be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the author's friends said they weren't wrong but were called an asshole. The author might be right in terms of the competition's intent, but the way they handled it led to conflict. The organizer had to step in and reverse the decision, which suggests there was a different expectation. The author's refusal to adjust their score despite the crowd's reaction could have been the wrong move, even if their initial judgment was based on talent.\n\nAnother angle is the disability aspect. The author didn't consider that the competition might have a different purpose, such as promoting inclusion. Even if Ryan's performance was poor, the crowd and others valued his participation and resilience. The author's strict scoring might have overlooked the broader purpose of the event. However, if the competition's rules were clear about judging purely on talent, then the author's actions are justified.\n\nThe main question is whether the competition was about talent or about supporting participants regardless of skill. If it was the latter, then the author's approach was wrong. If it was the former, they were right. The fact that the organizer had to step in implies that there was an unspoken expectation to consider factors beyond just technical skill. The author's refusal to adjust their score led to a negative outcome for the deserving winner and caused emotional distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the event's broader goals and the emotional impact on everyone involved.\n"
