There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a talent competition where the author, a judge, gave a low score to a contestant with a disability, leading to some conflict. The key elements here are the author's actions, the context of the competition, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they judged based on the performance. Ryan, the disabled contestant, played poorly and even changed his piece midway. The author gave him a 7/100, which the other judges didn't expect. The crowd and Ryan's mom were supportive, leading to the organizer making the author retract their decision to give Ryan the win. The author's friends say they're not wrong but an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author followed their judgment as a professional, but there's a conflict between objective skill and the crowd's emotional support. The author might have acted correctly in terms of technical evaluation, but the situation also involves a contestant with a disability. Did the author's judgment take into account the challenges Ryan might have faced due to his disability? The story mentions Ryan's performance was bad, but maybe the author didn't consider that his disability could impact his ability to play well. However, the author is a professional with experience, so they might argue they're judging based on the performance, not the person's circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the crowd and Ryan's mom were focused on effort and resilience. The author's low score contradicted the emotional response, leading to public backlash. The organizer forced the author to change their decision, which the author might feel was unfair. But in a competition, judges are supposed to evaluate based on skill, not crowd reaction. However, maybe there's an unspoken expectation to accommodate or acknowledge the contestant's disability, even if it's a talent competition.\n\nIs there a possibility of bias here? The author says Ryan didn't deserve the points, but the other judges didn't give such low scores. The author's score was an outlier. That suggests the author might have been too harsh, maybe even showing a lack of empathy towards Ryan's situation. Even if the author is technically correct, being an \"asshole\" as friends said could imply they were insensitive. Competitions can be harsh, but when a contestant has a disability, the line between fair judgment and insensitivity might be thinner.\n\nThe author's actions led to a deserving winner being booed and the trophy being given to Ryan despite his low skill. The author's refusal to compromise might have been correct in principle, but the aftermath shows that their judgment caused significant distress. The key issue is whether the author's judgment was fair and respectful, considering the contestant's disability. If the author didn't take into account the challenges Ryan faced, maybe they were in the wrong. But if the competition is purely based on skill, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author's friends' take that they're an asshole suggests there's a social expectation to be more empathetic in such situations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have technically done the right thing by judging based on performance, the situation involves a contestant with a disability, which could require a more nuanced approach. The author's harsh score and the subsequent fallout might indicate that they failed to consider the broader context, making them at least partially in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
