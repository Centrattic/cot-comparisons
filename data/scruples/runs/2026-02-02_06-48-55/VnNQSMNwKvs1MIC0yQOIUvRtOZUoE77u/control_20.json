There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. So the situation is that the author was a judge, and there were three contestants. One of them, Ryan, is in a wheelchair. He played really poorly, according to the author, but the crowd loved him because of his perseverance. The author gave him a 7/100, while the others got higher scores. The crowd booed the actual winner, and there was a lot of backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the competition is about musical talent and skill, then the author is right to judge based on that. However, if there's a different criteria, like audience participation or considering the contestant's circumstances, that might affect the judgment. The author mentions that the other judges were shocked by their low score, which might indicate that the author's standards were more strict or they didn't account for other factors others did.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of disability. The question is whether the author's harsh judgment was unfair because of Ryan's disability. The story says that Ryan's performance was terrible, but the crowd and others were supporting him for his effort. The author's decision might be seen as not acknowledging the spirit of the competition, which might value perseverance and participation over pure skill. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to giving a 7/100, which is extremely low. Even if the performance was bad, is that score justified? Maybe the author should have given a higher score for effort, even if the technical skill was lacking. The fact that Ryan changed his piece on stage and tried to keep going might be a point in his favor for some judges, even if the author didn't see it that way.\n\nThe other judges didn't follow up, so maybe they had different criteria. The author's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole because they were honest. The main issue is whether the author's judgment was appropriate. If the competition is purely about musical ability, then the author isn't wrong. But if the competition also values other factors like overcoming challenges or audience engagement, the author might be in the wrong for not considering those aspects.\n\nAdditionally, the way the author handled the situation might have been tactful. The backlash and the confrontation with Ryan's mom suggest that the author's approach was too blunt. Maybe the author should have discussed the scoring with the other judges before finalizing the results, especially when there was a significant discrepancy. \n\nIn the end, the organizer forced the author to have the trophy given to Ryan despite the author's belief that it was the wrong decision. That complicates things because the author's professional judgment was overruled, but the initial act of giving a low score based on skill isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author's refusal to consider the broader context (like audience support or the contestant's disability) might be seen as a lack of empathy, making them the asshole in the eyes of some.\n\nSo considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for not accounting for factors beyond technical skill, which the competition's context might have valued, leading to the negative outcome. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes).\n"
