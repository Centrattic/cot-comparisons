There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. So, the situation is that the author was a judge, and one of the contestants, Ryan, has a disability. The author scored Ryan very low, but the crowd and other judges didn't, leading to chaos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author believed they were judging based on talent and performance. They gave Ryan a 7/100, claiming he didn't deserve even that. The other judges were shocked, and the crowd was cheering for Ryan despite his performance. The organizer forced the author to retract their decision, leading to the trophy going to Ryan, even though he admitted he didn't deserve it.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical issues here are fairness, disability considerations, and the role of a judge. \n\nOn one hand, the author's duty as a judge is to evaluate based on the performance, regardless of the contestant's background. If Ryan's performance was objectively poor, the author might feel their job is to give an honest assessment. However, the problem arises when there's a potential for bias, either conscious or unconscious, against someone with a disability. The author might be accused of not considering the effort or the emotional impact of Ryan's participation, which the crowd and his mom emphasized. \n\nAlso, the crowd's reaction and the organizer's intervention suggest that there's a societal value placed on perseverance and overcoming adversity, which might not be captured in a purely technical score. The author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole, implying that while the author did what they thought was right, their approach was harsh and dismissive.\n\nBut then, as a judge, shouldn't you stick to the criteria given? If the competition is about musical talent, then scoring purely on that, even if it offends others, might be their responsibility. However, the situation escalated because of the crowd's reaction and the organizer's pressure, which might indicate that the author's strict adherence to technical merit caused unintended harm.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about Ryan not deserving even 7 points could be seen as harsh and lacking empathy. Even if Ryan made a mistake, the emotional aspect of his participation (being on a wheelchair, the crowd's support) might require a more nuanced approach. The author might have failed to balance technical evaluation with the broader context of the competition's purpose, which could include inspiring others or recognizing effort beyond raw talent.\n\nIn terms of disability considerations, there's a risk that the author's low score could be perceived as discriminatory if Ryan was judged not on his musical ability but on his disability. However, the author claims Ryan's performance was objectively bad. It's possible the author didn't account for factors like the difficulty of playing while managing a disability, but the story doesn't mention any accommodations or adjustments for Ryan's condition. \n\nThe aftermath shows that the author's actions led to public backlash and personal confrontation, which might indicate that their approach was socially unacceptable, even if they followed their own judgment. The fact that the other judges didn't want to engage suggests they agreed with the author's assessment but avoided conflict, while the organizer prioritized crowd satisfaction over fair judging.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's mistake might not be in scoring honestly but in not considering the broader implications of their judgment in a context where the competition's values might extend beyond technical skill. They may have failed to communicate their reasons effectively, leading to a breakdown in the event's management and emotional distress for everyone involved. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not balancing technical evaluation with empathy and the event's intended message.\n"
