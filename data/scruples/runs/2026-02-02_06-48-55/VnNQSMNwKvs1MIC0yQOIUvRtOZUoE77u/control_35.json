There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a talent competition where the author was a judge. There were three contestants, one of whom is in a wheelchair. The author gave Ryan, the kid with the wheelchair, a very low score, leading to the crowd's disapproval and some conflict.\n\nFirst, the main point is the author's decision to score Ryan based solely on his performance. The author is a music professional, so their opinion on musical skill might be valid. Ryan's performance was bad, according to the author, so maybe the low score is justified. But the problem is the context of the competition. Sometimes these events have a dual purpose\u2014celebrating talent and providing an opportunity for participants to showcase their efforts. Especially with Ryan's disability, maybe the organizers intended to encourage participation and perseverance over pure technical skill. The crowd and other judges might have appreciated Ryan's effort and emotional impact, which the author didn't consider. \n\nAlso, when the author gave such a low score, it caused a backlash. The crowd booed the deserving winner, and Ryan's mom was confrontational. The organizer made the author publicly retract their decision, which was humiliating. The author's friends said they were right for doing the right thing but called them an asshole. That's a key point. Even if the author acted on their principles, the way it was handled led to a negative outcome. The author didn't consider the broader context of the competition's purpose or the feelings of others, which might make them the asshole here. \n\nAdditionally, the author admitted to feeling terrible afterward, which suggests they realized their actions had unintended consequences. The key question is whether the competition's purpose was to purely evaluate talent or to include and honor all participants' efforts. If the latter, the author's strict judging criteria might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo while the author's assessment of Ryan's performance might be technically correct, they failed to consider the event's intent and the emotional impact on the participants and audience. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
