There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a talent competition where the author, a judge, gave a low score to a kid with a disability, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are fairness, the purpose of competitions, and the treatment of participants with disabilities. Competitions are supposed to be judged on skill and talent. The author argues they gave a low score because the performance was poor, but others felt sympathy for the disabled contestant.\n\nThe author's defense is that they are a professional musician and that the performance was objectively bad. However, the other judges disagreed, as evidenced by their shock at the low score. The crowd's reaction also suggests they valued effort over skill, which might have influenced the other judges' decisions. The author's actions led to a reversal of the decision, which was humiliating for the deserving winner and stressful for the author.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong to prioritize skill over the contestant's disability. Competitions should be merit-based, but there's also a consideration for inclusivity and recognizing effort. However, the author's approach was rigidly adhering to their opinion of merit without considering the context of the competition's purpose. The fact that Ryan, the disabled contestant, admitted he didn't deserve to win but still received the trophy and prize money complicates things. The author's refusal to compromise led to a situation where the actual winner was stripped of their victory, which could be seen as unfair to them.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response to the confrontation\u2014stating bluntly that they didn't think Ryan was as talented\u2014could be seen as insensitive, even if true. The way the author handled the situation, especially in a public and stressful environment, might have been tactless. While the author's intent was to be honest, the impact was harmful to all parties involved.\n\nSo, while the author's decision was based on their professional judgment, the execution and the resulting consequences suggest that they were in the wrong. Competitions should be fair, but the approach here lacked empathy and sensitivity to the broader context, leading to negative outcomes. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
