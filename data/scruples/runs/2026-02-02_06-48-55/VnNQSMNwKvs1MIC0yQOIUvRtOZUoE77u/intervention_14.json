There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author judged a kid with a disability and gave him a very low score, which caused controversy. The key points to consider are the author's actions, the context, and the ethical implications.\n\nFirst, the author was a judge in a music competition. Their role is to assess the talent and skill of the participants. The author claims that the kid with the disability (Ryan) played poorly, and that they gave him a 7/100. The other judges were shocked by this low score, and the crowd ended up supporting Ryan despite his performance. The author's decision led to a change in the winner after pressure from the audience and Ryan's mom, even though the author believed the first contestant was more deserving.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, judges are supposed to be fair and base their scores solely on the performance's merit. If Ryan's performance was indeed subpar, the author might have been correct in their assessment. However, the situation involves a person with a disability, which adds a layer of sensitivity. The crowd and Ryan's mom were influenced more by the emotional aspect of Ryan's struggle rather than his actual performance. The author's strict adherence to merit might clash with the compassionate response of the audience and organizers.\n\nAnother angle is the author's reaction after the fact. They were asked to retract their judgment and change the winner, which they did under pressure. But the author might argue that they were sticking to their professional judgment. However, the way they handled the confrontation with Ryan's mom and the subsequent aftermath could be seen as contributing to the tension. The author's friends called them an asshole but not wrong, which is a bit confusing. The author's intention was to be fair, but the outcome caused public backlash and emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the competition's purpose might be to encourage and reward effort, not just skill. Even if Ryan's performance was technically worse, his participation and perseverance might be valued in such events. The author's focus on technical skill might overlook the broader goals of the competition, especially considering it's for teenagers. The fact that Ryan was on a wheelchair might have made the audience and organizers more inclined to support him, regardless of the performance quality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate between strict meritocracy and compassionate support. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a purely technical sense if they evaluated the performance correctly, but they might have failed to consider the context and intentions of the competition. The author's insistence on their evaluation without compromise could be seen as lacking empathy, especially in a situation involving a vulnerable participant. However, judges are expected to make tough decisions based on their expertise.\n\nThe other judges didn't support the author, which suggests that their scoring was an outlier. The organizer and audience's reaction indicate that the community valued the emotional aspect over technical skill. The author's refusal to conform to the crowd's sentiment might be principled, but it also caused a negative outcome for the deserving winner and created a hostile environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to be fair, their approach might have been too rigid and insensitive to the broader context of the competition and the participants involved. They might be in the wrong for not considering the event's purpose beyond just technical evaluation and for causing harm to another contestant through their strict adherence to their own standards.\n"
