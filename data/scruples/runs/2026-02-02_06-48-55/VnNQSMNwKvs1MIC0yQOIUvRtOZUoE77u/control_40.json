There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a judge at a music contest for teenagers. Three finalists: one did a classical guitar piece, one on a wheelchair named Ryan played something, and the third played Tchaikovsky. The author gave Ryan a 7/100 because they thought his performance was terrible. The other judges were surprised by the low score. The crowd, however, loved Ryan's performance, especially after he changed his piece and started crying. The organizer pressured the author to retract their score, leading to the trophy and prize going to Ryan despite the author's opinion. \n\nThe author is now feeling conflicted because their friends called them an asshole for being honest, but the author doesn't think they did wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong to judge a contestant with a disability based purely on talent, without considering other factors. The author claims they gave the score based on the performance's quality, not the contestant's disability. However, the crowd and other judges might have been moved by Ryan's perseverance and the emotional aspect, which the author didn't factor in. \n\nBut wait, the competition is about talent. The author's role as a judge is to assess talent, so if the kid's performance was objectively worse, the author isn't wrong for scoring accordingly. However, there might be a lack of consideration for the context\u2014like the kid's disability affecting their performance. But the author says they gave 7/100 because the performance was bad, not because of the wheelchair. The problem is that the author's explanation might come off as dismissive, especially in light of the crowd's support and the emotional response. \n\nAlso, the author was an undergraduate student dealing with adults, which might have led to a backlash. The crowd's reaction and the organizer's pressure suggest that the community values effort and inspiration over pure technical skill in this context. The author's strict adherence to talent assessment could clash with the competition's expectations of being supportive.\n\nBut the author didn't judge based on disability; they judged based on the performance. The other judges might have considered the emotional impact, leading to different scores. So, the author's actions were technically within their role, but maybe the way they handled it and the situation where the crowd and organizer reacted negatively could imply that they were insensitive. \n\nBut wait, the author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole. That's a bit confusing. If they did the right thing by scoring fairly, but the way they did it was harsh, maybe they're in the wrong for not being more empathetic. However, if the competition's rules are clear about judging based on talent alone, the author might be correct. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a valid reason to score Ryan low? Yes, based on their assessment of the performance. But was it wrong to do so, considering the disability? If the disability wasn't the reason for the low score, then maybe not. However, the author's insistence on their score leading to the organizer forcing a correction might show a lack of understanding of the event's purpose. The event might be as much about inspiration as talent, especially with a scholarship involved. \n\nAlso, the author's confrontation with Ryan's mom, where they stated their opinion bluntly, could be seen as insensitive. Even if the author is correct in their assessment, the way they communicated it may have contributed to the problem. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for the action itself, not just the manner. \n\nSo, the author's decision was based on talent, but perhaps the competition's criteria weren't solely about technical skill. If the rules emphasized effort or inspiration, then the author might have misaligned with the event's goals. However, if the rules were strictly about musical talent, the author isn't wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the disability was a factor. Since the author says they didn't consider the disability but the performance, and if the performance was indeed bad, then technically the author isn't in the wrong. However, the context of the kid having a disability and the audience's reaction might mean that the author's judgment was viewed as harsh or lacking empathy, even if correct. \n\nBut in a competition setting, judges are supposed to evaluate based on the criteria. If the criteria are talent, then the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is the author's own admission that they felt pressured and called it a \"mistake\", which might indicate regret. The friends' consensus is that the author did the right thing but was an asshole, which is a bit of a contradiction. \n\nSo, the author's actions were correct in terms of judging the performance but the manner of handling the situation and the aftermath might be the issue. Therefore, the answer could be B (No), as the author wasn't wrong for judging based on talent, even if their approach was harsh. But there's a gray area here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have considered the kid's circumstances more, leading to a different score. But if the kid's performance was objectively worse, then the author's score is justified. The problem might be that the author didn't consider the broader context of the competition's intent to highlight perseverance. \n\nIn the end, the author followed their role as a judge, but the event's organizers might have had other priorities. The AITA aspect is about the author's perspective. If the author believed they were right, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the outcome was hurtful to the contestant and the crowd, so there's a case for being insensitive. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the action, not just the sensitivity. If the author's scoring was fair, then no. If the scoring was based on bias, then yes. The author claims it was about talent, so answer B.\n"
