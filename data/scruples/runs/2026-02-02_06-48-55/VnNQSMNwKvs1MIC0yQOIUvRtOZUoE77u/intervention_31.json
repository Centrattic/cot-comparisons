There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. The author scored Ryan, the kid in the wheelchair, a 7 out of 100 because they felt his performance was bad. The other judges were shocked, and the crowd turned against the actual talented winner, leading to the organizers changing the result.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective is that they did the right thing by being honest about the quality of the performance. They studied music and have experience, so they felt Ryan didn't deserve to win. But the problem here is the context of the competition and the potential for a different kind of purpose beyond just technical skill. Competitions sometimes aim to highlight perseverance or inspire others, which the crowd and Ryan's mom were emphasizing. The author's strict focus on technical merit might overlook these other values.\n\nThen there's the reaction from the crowd and the organizers. The crowd's support for Ryan, despite his performance, suggests that the competition wasn't solely about skill. The organizers stepped in to adjust the results under pressure, which the author had to comply with after being told to retract their score. This shows that the author's approach conflicted with the event's goals or the organizers' expectations, possibly causing more harm than good.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole for being honest, which is a common sentiment in these situations. The key issue is whether the competition was meant to be a purely technical assessment or if it had other objectives like encouraging participation or celebrating overcoming challenges. If the former, the author's actions are justified. If the latter, they were wrong to prioritize technical skill over these other aspects.\n\nAlso, the author's low score led to public backlash and personal confrontation, indicating that their judgment didn't align with the community's values. Even if the author believed in their assessment, causing such a reaction might be seen as insensitive. The organizers' request to retract the score suggests there were guidelines or intentions they were supposed to follow, which the author didn't consider.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent was to judge based on skill, the situation involved more than just technical ability. The author's actions disregarded the competition's potential broader goals and the emotional impact on participants and their families. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering these factors and causing distress.\n"
