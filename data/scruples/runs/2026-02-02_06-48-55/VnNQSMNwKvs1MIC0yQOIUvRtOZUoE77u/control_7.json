There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for giving a low score to a contestant with a disability in a talent competition. \n\nFirst, the author was a judge in a music contest. The key points here are their actions and motivations. The author gave the disabled contestant, Ryan, a 7/100, which they admit was extremely low, while the other contestants got much higher scores. The author's reasoning was that Ryan's performance was not good, even though he had a disability.\n\nNow, the main ethical question is whether the author acted appropriately. As a judge, their role is to evaluate based on skill and performance. The author claims they did that honestly, but the low score might have been influenced by the crowd's reaction or their own bias. However, the author didn't consider the context of the competition's purpose, which might have been to encourage and support participants, especially those with disabilities. \n\nThe aftermath was chaotic: the crowd boos the actual winner, the organizer forces a change in the results, and the author faces confrontation from Ryan's mother. The author's friends say they're not wrong but call them an asshole for being honest. This suggests there's a conflict between personal integrity and social expectations.\n\nLegally, as a judge, the author might have the right to give scores based on their judgment. However, ethically, the situation is more complex. Competitions should be fair, but in this case, the author's actions led to a negative outcome for Ryan, despite his disability. It's possible that the author overlooked the competition's intent to celebrate perseverance and effort, not just talent. \n\nAlso, the author's admission that Ryan's performance was bad but still giving such a low score might be seen as harsh. The fact that the other judges didn't agree with the low score indicates a discrepancy in judgment. The author's refusal to adjust their score despite the fallout could be seen as stubbornness rather than righteousness.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent was to be honest, their actions caused harm and disruption. The competition's environment and the context of the participants' circumstances might mean that the author didn't consider the broader impact of their judgment. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not balancing fairness with compassion in this specific scenario.\n"
