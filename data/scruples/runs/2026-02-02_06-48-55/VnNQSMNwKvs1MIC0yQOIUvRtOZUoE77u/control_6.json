There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was a judge at a talent competition with three contestants. One of them, Ryan, has a disability and uses a wheelchair. The other two are mentioned as the first and third contestants. Ryan's performance was described as terrible\u2014so bad that the author gave him a 7/100. The author felt strongly that Ryan didn't deserve to win, but the audience and other judges didn't agree. The crowd was cheering for Ryan even after he messed up, and when the author's scores caused Ryan to lose, there was backlash. The organizer made the author publicly retract their decision, leading to Ryan winning despite the author's belief that he wasn't talented enough.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, which led to a conflict. The author's friends called them an asshole but not wrong, while the person is unsure if they are the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on merit, right? The author's argument is that they followed their professional judgment, giving scores based on the quality of the performances. However, there's a possible issue with how the situation was handled. Did the author consider the intent of the competition? The competition might have been aimed at encouraging participants, especially those with disabilities, rather than just pure talent. The crowd's reaction suggests that the audience valued Ryan's effort and perseverance over technical skill. The author's low score might have clashed with the event's purpose, which could be more about inclusion and participation than strict merit.\n\nAnother angle is the disability aspect. Ryan's performance was difficult, and he had to switch pieces. The crowd's support for him might be because they appreciated his courage despite the technical flaws. The author's harsh judgment could be seen as insensitive, focusing only on the outcome rather than the effort. Even if the author is technically correct in their assessment, there might be a lack of compassion here.\n\nAlso, when the other judges and the crowd disagreed, the author's refusal to compromise led to further conflict. The organizer had to intervene, and the author was forced to retract their decision. This could indicate that the author didn't consider the broader impact of their actions on the participants and the event's atmosphere.\n\nBut wait, the author did state that they judged based on the performances. If the competition's rules were clear that it's strictly about talent, then maybe the author was right. However, if the competition had an element of inclusivity or encouragement, then the author's strict score might not align with the event's goals. The fact that Ryan's mom and the crowd were supportive suggests that the event might have valued participation and effort more than technical skill.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response after the fact\u2014saying they didn't think Ryan deserved to win and being confrontational\u2014could be seen as dismissive of the emotional and social context. The organizer's request to retract the decision might have been to maintain harmony and the event's positive message, which the author resisted.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were technically following their judgment of skill, but they might have failed to consider the event's purpose and the sensitivities around disability and inclusion. Their harsh judgment could be seen as contributing to a negative experience for Ryan and his family, even if they believed they were being fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that the competition's environment might prioritize encouragement and inclusivity over strict technical merit.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A  \nThe author is in the wrong because their strict adherence to technical merit overlooked the competition's likely purpose of fostering inclusion and encouragement. While judging based on skill is valid, the context\u2014supporting a participant with a disability, audience reaction, and the event's potential emphasis on perseverance\u2014suggests the author failed to consider these broader values. Their actions contributed to a negative experience for Ryan and his family, prioritizing personal judgment over the event's inclusive spirit.",
