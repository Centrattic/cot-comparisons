There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making a kid with a disability lose a talent competition. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a judge with a professional background in music. They felt that Ryan, the kid in the wheelchair, played poorly and didn't deserve to win. The other judges and the crowd had a different reaction, cheering for Ryan and eventually giving him the title after the author's low score. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's decision was fair. The author argues that Ryan's performance was subpar and that they were just being honest. However, competitions are judged based on skill, and if the author felt Ryan's performance was significantly worse, their responsibility is to judge based on merit. But there's a possible bias here\u2014maybe the author judged Ryan more harshly because of his disability. The story mentions that the crowd and Ryan's mom were emphasizing his effort and perseverance over skill, which might have caused tension. \n\nThe author's low score led to a chaotic outcome where the crowd boos the more deserving winner. The organizer made the author publicly retract their judgment, which humiliated the original winner. The author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole, implying that they did the right thing but in a harsh way. \n\nBut is it wrong to judge based on skill? If the competition's criteria are strictly about musical ability, then the author was correct. However, if the competition also values participation, effort, or inspirational stories (as the crowd's reaction suggests), the author might have ignored those aspects. Also, there's the question of the author's intent. Did they score Ryan low because he had a disability, or because his performance was objectively worse? The story says Ryan's playing was \"atrocious,\" so maybe it's the former. \n\nHowever, the author's actions led to a negative outcome for the deserving winner and the audience's backlash. The problem might be that the author didn't consider the competition's purpose beyond just skill. Competitions can have elements of inspiration and participation, especially when involving individuals with disabilities. The author's strict adherence to skill might have overlooked the broader impact of the event.\n\nAlso, the author's friends' reaction is mixed. They call the author an asshole but not wrong. That suggests some conflict between doing the right thing and being tactful. But in terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not balancing skill with other values the competition might have had, or for not considering the situation's sensitivity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's judgment based on skill is valid, the outcome caused harm, and the context of the competition's values (especially involving a participant with a disability) might mean the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
