There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author is a judge. There are three contestants, one of whom is in a wheelchair. The author gives him a very low score, which leads to controversy. The crowd and others seem to support the disabled contestant even though his performance was poor. The author is then pressured to change the result, which he does, but ends up in a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of fairness and judging criteria. As a judge, the author's job is to assess the talent objectively. If Ryan's performance was indeed subpar compared to the others, then the author's score might be justified. But the problem arises when the other judges and the crowd react negatively. The author's low score could be seen as unfair if the criteria didn't account for the contestant's disability or if there was a lack of proper accommodations.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that Ryan's performance was terrible, even to the point of making him cringe. The fact that the crowd and others were cheering for Ryan despite his poor performance suggests that there might be an emotional bias towards him because of his disability. The author's strict adherence to talent might clash with others' expectations of inclusivity or empathy. \n\nThe key question is whether the author should have considered factors beyond just technical skill. Competitions sometimes have criteria that include effort, perseverance, or overcoming challenges, even if it's not explicitly stated. If the competition's rules only focus on technical skill, then the author is right to judge based on that. But if there's an unspoken expectation to reward effort or inclusivity, the author might be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the author's actions caused distress to Ryan and his family. Even if the author believed in his scores, the situation escalated to the point where the organizer had to intervene. The author's refusal to compromise might have caused unnecessary harm, even if the initial judgment was based on talent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did what he thought was right based on his expertise. He wasn't being malicious but was sticking to his standards. The other judges didn't support him, but he didn't force them. The pressure from the crowd and organizers to overturn the decision might indicate that the environment wasn't ready for an objective assessment based purely on skill.\n\nIn the end, while the author wasn't wrong in his assessment of the talent, the way the situation unfolded and the consequences might make him the asshole for not considering the broader context and the emotional impact of his decision. However, if the competition's sole purpose was to evaluate technical ability without considering other factors, then he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't account for the social dynamics and the potential for his judgment to cause harm.\n"
