There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a talent competition where the author judged a kid with a disability and gave him a very low score, leading to controversy. \n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they judged based on talent. Ryan, the kid in a wheelchair, played poorly according to the author's professional opinion. But the crowd and other judges liked him for his effort and perseverance. The author gave him a 7/100, which was much lower than the other contestants. The organizers forced the author to retract the decision, leading to Ryan winning. The author is now being called an asshole by friends but claims they were just being honest.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Competitions are meant to be judged on merit, but there's also the aspect of empathy and inclusivity. The competition might have a rule that prioritizes talent, but if it's a community event, the crowd's reaction might be about supporting someone who overcame challenges. The author's harsh judgment could be seen as insensitive, especially since Ryan's mother and the crowd were moved by his effort. \n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but call them an asshole, which suggests a conflict between doing what's right by the rules and being considerate of the emotional impact. The author's actions led to public humiliation for both the deserving winner and themselves. Also, the mom's confrontation might have been triggered by the author's blunt honesty, which wasn't delivered diplomatically. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the competition's criteria were strictly based on skill, the author did their job. But if there's an unspoken expectation to consider other factors like effort or the spirit of the event, then the author might have missed that. Also, the way the author handled the situation\u2014being rigid and not considering the broader context\u2014could be seen as lacking empathy. The fact that the organizers had to intervene and make the author retract their judgment shows that there's more to the situation than just technical skill. \n\nSo, while the author might believe they were fair, their approach didn't account for the event's possible purpose beyond just talent. The author's answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they followed their professional judgment. But the community's reaction and the mom's response indicate that there's a social expectation to be more inclusive. However, technically, the author isn't in the wrong if the competition's rules were clear. But maybe the question is about social responsibility beyond the rules. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the competition's criteria were strictly technical. If the author was supposed to judge only on musical skill, then they're right. But if the event had a different goal, like encouraging participants regardless of skill, then the author is wrong. Since the organizer forced the author to change the outcome, implying that the event had a different intent, then the author's strict adherence might be misplaced. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the event's purpose beyond talent. Hence, answer A.\n"
