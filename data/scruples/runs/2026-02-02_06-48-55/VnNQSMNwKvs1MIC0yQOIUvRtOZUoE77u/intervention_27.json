There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving a very low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a judge in a music competition. There were three final contestants. One of them, Ryan, is in a wheelchair. The author gives Ryan a 7 out of 100, which is extremely low, while the other two get higher scores. The other judges seem surprised by the low score. The crowd boos when the original winner (who the author thinks deserves it) is announced, but then cheers when Ryan is declared the winner after the decision is reversed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Ryan's performance was objectively worse, even though he tried to switch songs and the crowd liked him for perseverance. The author argues that they judged based on skill and that they didn't mean to target Ryan because of his disability. However, the result was that Ryan lost, and the crowd's reaction was negative towards the original winner.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The main issue here is whether the author's judgment was fair. The author claims they are being objective, rating based on musical skill. But Ryan's performance was described as terrible, even to the point of making the author cringe. However, the crowd and other participants were cheering for Ryan, valuing his effort and perseverance despite the technical skill.\n\nBut here's the problem: in competitions, especially talent shows, there's often a balance between technical skill and the \"performance\" aspect. Some competitions might prioritize technical ability, others might consider audience appeal or emotional impact. The author's strict adherence to technical skill might be valid, but if the competition's rules or the organizer's intent included other factors, the author's scoring could be seen as misaligned.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The organizer forced the author to publicly retract their judgment, which made the actual winner lose. The author might have felt wronged because they were pressured to change their honest assessment. However, the way the situation escalated could be due to the author's initial scoring. The author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole, implying that while the action is understandable, it's socially unacceptable.\n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the competition is purely about skill, then the author isn't wrong. However, if the competition had elements like audience reaction or if the organizers had different criteria (like promoting inclusion or effort), then the author's strict scoring might have been inappropriate. Also, the fact that the author's low score caused a negative reaction from the crowd against the deserving winner might have contributed to a poor outcome.\n\nMoreover, there's the aspect of disability. Even though the author claims to be judging based on skill, the fact that the contestant is in a wheelchair and the crowd's emotional response might indicate that some people valued his participation and effort over technical skill. The author might have been unaware of the broader context or the event's purpose to celebrate perseverance, which could lead to a conflict between objective skill and subjective values.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might believe they were being fair by rating based on skill, the situation may require considering other factors like the event's purpose, audience expectations, or the organizers' guidelines. The author's refusal to adjust their score despite the consequences could be seen as inflexible or not considering the broader impact, thus making them at least partially at fault.\n"
