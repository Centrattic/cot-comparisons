There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a talent competition where the author is a judge. The key points are that one of the contestants has a disability and the author gave them a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, the author argues that they judged based on talent. The other contestants practiced a lot, but Ryan, the one in a wheelchair, played poorly. The author felt he didn't deserve the high praise from the crowd and the other judges. However, the crowd and the other judges were more supportive of Ryan because of his disability, leading to the author's low score being a point of contention.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for scoring based purely on performance. The author claims it was about talent, but the crowd and others valued effort and perseverance, especially considering Ryan's disability. The mother's reaction and the crowd's support suggest that there's a societal expectation to reward effort and overcome adversity, even if the performance isn't technically good.\n\nBut is that the role of a judge? Judges are supposed to assess skill and technical ability, not just effort. However, the author might be seen as insensitive to the broader context of the contestant's circumstances. Even if the author's judgment was technically correct, the social impact could be negative, making them appear heartless.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's background in music justifies their expertise, and they might believe their assessment was fair. But the problem arises when their actions caused embarrassment to the other contestant and upset the audience. The organizers had to reverse the decision, which shows that the author's approach disrupted the event's harmony and possibly the intentions behind the competition.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's technical assessment might be valid, the way they handled it\u2014without considering the emotional and social aspects\u2014could be seen as wrong. The key issue is whether the competition's purpose was to reward talent or to inspire and recognize perseverance, especially in someone with a disability. If it's the latter, the author's approach was inappropriate. If it's the former, then it's not their fault. But in most public events, especially involving vulnerable participants, a balance is needed. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for not accounting for the broader context and causing distress.\n"
