There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were a judge in a talent competition and gave a low score to a kid with a disability because they didn't think he was talented enough. The other judges and the crowd were on his side, leading to a lot of backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the competition is supposed to be judged based solely on talent and musical ability, then the author might be right in their assessment. They have credentials in music, so their judgment could be valid. But Ryan, the kid with the disability, played poorly, and the author gave him a 7/100. But the crowd and others were cheering him for his effort and perseverance, not just skill.\n\nThen there's the aspect of disability. Competitions can be for people with disabilities, but the key is whether the competition's criteria are based on talent. If the event is designed to celebrate perseverance or participation, maybe the author's strict grading clashed with that. However, the author's job as a judge is to evaluate based on the given criteria. If the criteria are purely talent, then maybe the author did the right thing. But if there's an unspoken expectation to support participants regardless of skill, then they might be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the crowd boos the more talented guy, and the organizer forces the author to retract their judgment. This suggests that the community values participation and effort over technical skill. The author's honesty might have been misinterpreted as meanness, especially when confronting Ryan's mom. The mom's reaction could be partly due to feeling that her son was unfairly judged, especially if there was an expectation that disability should be accommodated or celebrated regardless of performance.\n\nAnother angle is the author's personal justification. They believed they were right, but the social backlash indicates that their approach was not considered acceptable. Even if they are technically correct in their assessment, the impact on others might make them the asshole. The friends said they're not wrong but are an asshole, which points to the conflict between being honest and being considerate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the competition's stated criteria were talent, maybe not. But if the event's purpose was to encourage participation and support individuals with disabilities, then the author's strict adherence to talent might have overlooked that. Additionally, the way they handled the situation, especially the confrontation, could be seen as insensitive. The organizer made them change the decision, which might mean the author's approach didn't align with the event's goals. Therefore, the author might be wrong because they didn't account for the event's intent beyond just technical skill.\n"
