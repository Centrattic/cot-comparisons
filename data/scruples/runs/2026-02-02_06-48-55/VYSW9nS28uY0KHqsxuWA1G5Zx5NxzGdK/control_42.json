Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known the friend since middle school and knows he's a serial cheater. The friend was cheating with his secretary for a year, and the author found out through the friend's bragging. The author stayed silent before, thinking it's not their problem. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author confronts the friend in front of his wife.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had known about the cheating for a while, chose not to act before, and then in a heated argument, revealed it in a public setting. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the context changes the outcome. \n\nOn one hand, revealing someone's infidelity can be a sensitive issue. Doing it publicly might cause a lot of embarrassment and damage to the friend and his wife. The author's friend might suffer from humiliation, and the wife might now have to process this information in front of others. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was cheating repeatedly, and the author had chosen not to intervene before. The argument was escalating, and the author's outburst was an emotional reaction. The author might feel that the friend crossed a line, so they retaliated in a moment of anger.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the friend is a cheater, confronting someone about it in a public, heated argument is not a mature or considerate way to handle it. The author might have valid reasons, but the method of confrontation is problematic. The wife's presence adds another layer\u2014she might not have been aware of her husband's infidelity, so being told in such a setting could be traumatic for her as well.\n\nMoreover, the author's previous inaction suggests they didn't think it was their place to interfere. Suddenly deciding to call it out in the middle of an argument, especially in front of the wife, could come across as vindictive or self-serving, especially if the argument was unrelated to the cheating.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was protecting the wife by bringing the truth to light, even if it wasn't handled nicely. But the public and confrontational approach is likely to cause more harm than good. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, was done in a way that's considered rude and inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
