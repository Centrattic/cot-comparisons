Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has a history of cheating, and the author knew about it but didn't say anything before. The argument happened at a brewery, and in the heat of the moment, the author brought up the cheating in front of the friend's wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author claims they've known about the cheating for a while but stayed silent before. Now, they confronted the friend in public during an argument, which could be seen as a harsh move. The key points are: the context of a heated argument, the timing (in front of the wife), and the author's prior inaction.\n\nOn one hand, exposing someone's infidelity can be a sensitive issue. Doing it in public and during a conflict might cause emotional harm to both the friend and his wife. The wife might have been blindsided, which could damage their marriage and trust. The author might not have considered the best way to handle it, like a private conversation, instead of an angry outburst.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was aware of ongoing cheating for a year and didn't intervene. The friend's behavior was hurtful, and the author felt justified in the moment. However, the method of confrontation was inappropriate. Even if the intention was good, the timing and public setting were poor choices.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the context (the argument and the friend's history) justifies the confrontation. But generally, calling someone out in front of their spouse during an argument is seen as tactless and harmful, regardless of prior knowledge. The right approach would have been to address it privately, not in a heated public setting. Therefore, the author made a poor decision in how they handled it, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
