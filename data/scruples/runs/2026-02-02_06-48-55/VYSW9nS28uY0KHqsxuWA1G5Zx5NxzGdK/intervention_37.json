Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who cheated, and the author called him out in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has known their friend since middle school and has known about his cheating for a long time. They chose not to say anything before, thinking it wasn't their problem. But during an argument at a brewery, they lashed out and mentioned the cheating in front of the friend's wife.\n\nThe key points here are intent, timing, and context. The author says they did it out of anger during an argument. They didn't confront the friend privately first; instead, they brought it up publicly. Even if the friend was cheating, bringing it up in front of his wife during a heated moment might be unkind and unhelpful. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The author didn't make up the cheating; the friend had bragged about it. The author's action was to call out the cheating, which could be seen as trying to do the right thing. However, the method was inappropriate. Confronting someone in a public, emotional setting without prior discussion is usually not the best approach.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the goal was to help the wife, maybe they were trying to do the right thing but in the wrong way. But if the timing and manner were reckless, then they might be at fault. \n\nConsidering that the author had previously stayed silent and chose an argument to bring it up impulsively, it's possible that they crossed a line. Even if the information is true, the delivery was thoughtless. The wife might have appreciated knowing, but the way it was revealed caused her embarrassment and possibly hurt the relationship. \n\nSo, while the intent might have been to help, the execution was poor. The answer likely hinges on whether the method of revealing the truth was appropriate. In this case, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it in a respectful or private manner, which is usually expected when dealing with sensitive issues.\n"
