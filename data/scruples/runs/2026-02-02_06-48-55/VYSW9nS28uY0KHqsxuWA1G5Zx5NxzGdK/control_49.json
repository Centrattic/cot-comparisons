Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has known their buddy since middle school, and the friend has a history of cheating, including with his current secretary. The author found out but didn't say anything before, choosing to ignore it. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author blurts out the accusation in front of the wife. The key here is the context of the argument and the fact that the wife was present.\n\nNow, considering typical social norms, confronting someone about cheating is sensitive. Usually, it's advised to approach such situations privately to avoid public humiliation. But the author did this during an escalating argument, which complicates things. The question is whether the context changes the morality of the action.\n\nThe author's intent was out of anger, not a deliberate plan to hurt the friend or his wife. However, the consequence is that the wife heard the accusation. If the author believed the cheating was happening, they might have thought they were doing the right thing. But the method\u2014saying it in front of her\u2014could be seen as thoughtless or cruel, especially if the argument wasn't about the infidelity itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was a serial cheater and liked to brag, so maybe the author felt it was justified. But even so, the public confrontation might not be the best approach. The wife has a right to know, but the way she's told matters. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it more carefully, but if the friend was indeed cheating, maybe the author did the right thing despite the timing.\n\nHmm. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks at intent and consequences. The author acted out of anger, which might be seen as impulsive rather than thoughtful. But the outcome could be positive if it leads to the wife knowing the truth. However, the public setting and the manner of the accusation could be problematic. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on whether the author's decision to call it out in that moment was reasonable. But generally, confronting someone in front of their partner during an argument isn't considered proper, so maybe A is the answer. Wait, but some might argue that if the friend was actively cheating, the author had a duty to tell. However, the line between right and wrong here is thin. The key is the public confrontation and the lack of discretion. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't take the right approach, even if the intent was good. Answer A.\n"
