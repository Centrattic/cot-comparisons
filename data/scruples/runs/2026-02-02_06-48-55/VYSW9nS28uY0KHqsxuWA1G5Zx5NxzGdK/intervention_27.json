Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of the friend's wife.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has known their friend since middle school, and the friend has a history of cheating. The author has stayed silent in the past, not telling the friend's ex-partners. Recently, during an argument at a brewery with the friend's wife present, the author confronts him, accusing him of cheating on his wife with the secretary. The key points here are the context of the argument, the presence of the wife, and the author's past behavior of not interfering before.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author's action (calling out the cheating in front of the wife) makes them the asshole. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, confronting someone about cheating in front of their spouse could be seen as violating trust and privacy. Even if the person is an abuser, doing it in a public setting during a heated argument might not be the best approach. On the other hand, the author might believe they are doing the right thing by exposing the infidelity to protect the wife. But the method and timing could be problematic.\n\nThe author's past behavior of staying silent suggests they didn't think it was their role to intervene before. Now, doing it in a confrontational manner during an argument might be seen as using a personal attack, which is a low blow regardless of the truth. The wife was present, so this could cause immediate harm to her, but it also might be the first time she learns about the infidelity. However, the way it's delivered\u2014during an argument\u2014could be seen as using it as a weapon rather than a genuine effort to help.\n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the impact. If the author's intent was to help the wife, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe they're not the sole asshole. However, the act of revealing such private information in a public, argumentative context is generally considered a breach of trust and could be seen as a mean-spirited attack, especially if it's done out of anger rather than a constructive intent.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action might be seen as crossing a line, even if the information is true. The method and timing are questionable, so the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
