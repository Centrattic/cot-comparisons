Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. So the situation is that they've known each other since middle school, and the friend has a history of cheating. The author knew about the cheating with the secretary for a year but never told the wife before. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author blurts out the accusation in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around exposing someone's infidelity. Generally, telling someone they're being cheated on is a sensitive issue. Even if the person is a cheater, the method and timing matter. The author did it in the heat of an argument, which might not be the best way. But the user is asking if the context changes the wrongness.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they had previously chosen not to involve themselves, considering it not their problem. But this time, during an argument, they lost their temper and revealed the secret. The key points here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to retaliate during an argument, which might be seen as using a personal attack. The impact is that the wife now knows, which is a big deal.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend was cheating, and the wife had a right to know. But the way it was done was confrontational and in the moment of anger, which could be seen as harsh. However, sometimes there's a moral obligation to speak up if someone is being wronged. But the author had kept quiet before, so maybe they were just using the argument as a way to get back at their friend. \n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is an asshole. If the action was meant to protect the wife, even if done poorly, maybe it's not their fault. But if it was just a spiteful remark during a fight, then they might be wrong. The community often in AITA threads considers the intention and the outcome. Since the wife was sitting there, the author's statement directly affected her, which is a significant consequence. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the act was justified. Even if the friend was cheating, the author's method of revealing it in the middle of an argument could be seen as insensitivity. However, the fact that the friend had a history of cheating might make the author's action more understandable, even if poorly timed. The user is asking if the context changes it. In some contexts, it's a justified revelation, but the way it was done might still be wrong. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because they revealed a truth that the wife needed to know, even if it was done in a heated moment. However, others might argue that the method was inappropriate. But given that the friend was a serial cheater and the author had been aware, the action, while perhaps not the best approach, might be seen as necessary. So the answer is B.\n"
