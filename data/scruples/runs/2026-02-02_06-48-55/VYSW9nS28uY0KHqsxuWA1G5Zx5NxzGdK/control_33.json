Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that they've known each other since middle school, the friend has a history of cheating, and the author found out about the current affair with the secretary. The author kept quiet before but during an argument, they blurted it out in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't confront the friend before, just ignored it. Then, during an argument, they said it out of anger when the wife was present. The question is whether that's an asshole move despite the context.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're doing the right thing by exposing the cheating. But doing it in the heat of an argument in front of the wife could be seen as a betrayal. Friends usually don't out each other in such a public and emotional way. Even if the friend is a cheater, the method of revealing it matters. The author might have crossed a line by using the argument as a platform to call out the cheating, which could hurt the wife more than help. Also, the author's history of not saying anything before might make this public accusation seem vindictive rather than protective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to prevent the wife from being hurt by not knowing. But even with good intentions, the way it's done affects the judgment. If it's a spur-of-the-moment reaction during an argument rather than a private, thoughtful discussion, it's probably not the best approach. The wife might appreciate knowing, but the context of an argument and the public setting could make it seem more like a personal attack on the friend rather than a responsible action.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's action was inconsiderate and unkind, even if the intent was to help. The method and timing were poor, leading to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
