Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been cheating multiple times, including with his current secretary. The author knew about this for a year but never told the wife before. Then, during an argument at a brewery with the wife present, the author yells that the friend is cheating on his wife with the secretary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Telling someone their partner is cheating is usually seen as a good deed, but the context matters. The author knew about the cheating for a long time but chose to stay silent. Now, they did it in a public place during an argument, which might have been impulsive. \n\nThe key points: Was it right to finally tell the wife, even if it was in a heated moment? The author might have felt guilty for not speaking up before, but doing it in the middle of an argument might not be the best approach. However, the act of revealing the infidelity could be seen as a necessary action to protect the wife from being hurt. \n\nBut there's also the method. Telling someone in a confrontational way during an argument, especially with the person present, could be seen as cruel or tactless. Even if the information is true, the timing and manner might be considered wrong. On the other hand, the author might have felt that the friend's cheating was too much to ignore and that the wife deserved to know, regardless of the method.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the act of revealing the truth is justified, then maybe not. But the way they did it could be seen as inappropriate. The question is whether the context (longtime friend, prior knowledge, argument situation) changes the morality. \n\nIn some perspectives, exposing someone's infidelity to their spouse is a moral obligation, even if done poorly. Others might say that the author should have handled it more discreetly. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But generally, while the method was poor, the intent was to help the wife. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the method could make it a bad move, hence in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the core action was telling the truth to the spouse, even if the timing was bad. However, the fact that it was done in a public argument might make it a poor decision, but not necessarily an ass move. The original statement says \"Telling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move.\" So according to that, the answer would be B (No). But maybe the context (doing it in anger during an argument) makes it an asshole move. Hmm. The user is asking if the context changes that. So if the action is justified despite the method, then B. If the method makes it wrong, then A.\n"
