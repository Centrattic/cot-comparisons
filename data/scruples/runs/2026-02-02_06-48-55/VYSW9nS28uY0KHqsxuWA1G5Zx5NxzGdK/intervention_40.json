Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has known their buddy since middle school, and the buddy has a history of cheating. The author knew about the current cheating with the secretary but never told the wife before. Now, during an argument at a brewery where the wife is present, the author calls out the buddy for cheating. The question is whether the author's action is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've known about the cheating for a while and chose not to tell the wife before, maybe thinking it wasn't their problem. But during an argument, in a public place with the wife present, the author blurts it out. The key factors here are: intent, context, and the impact on others.\n\nIntentionally calling someone out in front of their spouse can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to stop the cheating or help the wife, the method might be problematic. Publicly shaming someone, even if the behavior is wrong, can have serious consequences. It could damage the relationship irreparably and cause emotional distress to the spouse, who might not be ready to hear it that way. \n\nAlso, the author admits they did this out of anger during an argument. That raises questions about whether the timing and emotional state were appropriate. If the author was acting out of anger rather than a genuine desire to help, that could make the action more harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out a betrayal that the wife is unaware of, which is a serious matter. However, the method of disclosure is crucial here. Telling someone in a private, respectful manner is different from confronting them in a heated public argument. The author's action might have been well-intentioned but poorly executed. \n\nBut does the context change the wrongness of the action? The original question is whether calling out the cheating when the wife is present is an asshole move. The author argues that maybe the context (the buddy being a serial cheater) justifies it. However, even in cases of cheating, public confrontation without prior discussion can be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action, while based on knowledge of a wrong, was done in a way that was public, confrontational, and during an argument. This might be seen as inconsiderate of the wife's feelings and the potential fallout. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they chose a method that was harmful and abrupt, even if the underlying issue isn't their fault.\n"
