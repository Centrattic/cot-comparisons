Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has known their friend since middle school and has been aware that the friend is a serial cheater, currently cheating on his wife with the secretary. The author didn't intervene before, choosing to stay out of it. But after an argument, they blurted out the accusation in front of the wife. \n\nThe key points here are the context and the method of disclosure. The author didn't confront the friend privately first; instead, they made the revelation in a public setting during an argument. Even though the information is true, the way it was delivered was out of anger and in front of the wife. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're exposing a friend's infidelity, which is a serious matter. On the other hand, they did it impulsively and in a public, confrontational manner. \n\nEthically, confronting someone about cheating is complicated. If the author had approached the situation with the wife privately, maybe that's a different story. But doing it in front of her during an argument adds emotional weight and could be seen as a betrayal of trust between friends, even if the information is true. \n\nAlso, the author's prior inaction matters. They knew about the cheating for a long time but never said anything. Suddenly bringing it up in the heat of the moment might be seen as a power move or revenge during the argument. \n\nHowever, the content of the message itself\u2014telling the wife about the cheating\u2014is generally considered a moral action. But the circumstances (public, angry, not private) might taint it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on the context. If the method was inappropriate, even if the intent was good, the author might still be in the wrong. They could have handled it more responsibly by either approaching the wife privately without confrontation or discussing it with the friend first. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the manner and timing of the disclosure.\n"
