Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The key points here are the context and the intent.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend has a history of cheating, including currently with his secretary. The author has known about this for a while but didn't say anything before. The confrontation happened after an argument where the friend said some hurtful things. The author, in anger, reveals the cheating in front of the friend's wife.\n\nNow, the main question is whether this was the wrong thing to do. On one hand, the wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating. On the other hand, the author didn't handle it privately and did it out of anger during an argument. The method of confrontation might be as important as the truth itself. Even though the information is true, the way it's delivered in the heat of the moment and in front of others could be considered insensitive or unkind. The author's motive was retaliation, which complicates things. \n\nBut the act of telling someone they're being cheated on is generally seen as a moral high ground. However, the context here is that it's a friend who's known for cheating, and the author didn't approach it privately. Also, the situation was already tense, so the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they revealed the truth, but the manner was poor. However, some might argue that even if it's true, the way it was done was wrong. The dilemma here is between the intention to do the right thing vs the method of doing it. The author's anger might have clouded judgment, leading to a public confrontation instead of a private one. \n\nBut since the core issue is the wife's right to know, the act itself isn't wrong. The mistake was the timing and setting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action (telling the truth) is justified, even if the method is flawed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if we consider that it's a friend's private matter and the author overstepped, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the key here is that while the intent was to do the right thing, the execution was poor. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it more discreetly, especially given the existing friendship and the fact that it was done in anger. But others might say that the wife needs to know regardless of the method. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the public and hostile way it was delivered.\n"
