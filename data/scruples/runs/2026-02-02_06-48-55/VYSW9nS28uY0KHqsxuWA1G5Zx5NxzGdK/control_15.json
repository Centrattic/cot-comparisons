Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person called out their friend for cheating in front of the friend's wife. They've known the friend since middle school and knew about the cheating for over a year. They usually didn't interfere before, but during an argument, out of anger, they blurted it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are the long-term friendship, the knowledge of past cheating, and the public confrontation during an argument. The person didn't tell the wife before, choosing to stay neutral. Now, they acted out of anger, not a deliberate plan. \n\nCheating is a serious issue, and confronting someone in front of their spouse is usually considered a big deal. The question is whether the context (like the friend being a serial cheater and the argument's escalation) excuses the action. \n\nIn terms of relationships, even if the friend has cheated before, bringing it up in the heat of the moment in front of the wife could be seen as crossing a line. The motivation was anger, not a genuine concern for the wife. Also, the person had a history of not interfering before, so this sudden action might be unexpected and hurtful. \n\nHowever, some might argue that exposing the truth is necessary, especially if the wife didn't know. But the method\u2014doing it publicly and during an argument\u2014might be the problem. The person might not be an asshole if their intent was to stop the cheating, but the way they did it was inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the person's action was out of spite or just to get back at their friend for the argument, that's more of a personal vendetta. The line between right and wrong here is thin. The key factors are the intent and the impact. If the intent was to protect the wife, maybe it's justified. But if it was retaliation, then it's wrong.\n\nGiven that the person acted out of anger during an argument and didn't consider the wife's perspective or the public setting, it's likely they're in the wrong. The fact that they didn't address it before and only did so when provoked suggests it was more about their own frustration than a genuine concern for the wife. So, the answer is probably A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
