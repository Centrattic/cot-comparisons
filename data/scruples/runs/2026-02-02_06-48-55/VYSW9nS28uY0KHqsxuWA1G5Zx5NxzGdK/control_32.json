Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has known their buddy since middle school and the buddy has a history of cheating, including with his current secretary. The author has stayed silent before, thinking it's not their problem. Then, during an argument at a brewery where the buddy's wife is present, the author calls out the cheating in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've known about the cheating for a while and the buddy brags about it. The author didn't intervene before, but this time, during an argument, they said it in front of his wife. The key here is the timing and the intent. The author says it was out of anger. \n\nNow, the question is whether calling out the cheating in front of his wife makes them the asshole. Normally, if someone is being cheated on, telling the spouse might be seen as a good deed. But in this case, the author had a history of not saying anything before. Also, they did it during an argument when their buddy was throwing low blows. So maybe the author was retaliating with a personal attack instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motive was out of anger, which could be seen as using the cheating accusation as a weapon in an argument rather than a genuine attempt to help. The fact that they waited until a heated moment to bring it up might indicate that it was more about getting back at their friend rather than doing the right thing.\n\nBut then, the cheating is a serious issue. If the author was trying to protect the wife, maybe it's justified. However, the method of revealing it in front of her during an argument could be harmful. The wife might not want to hear it from a friend in such a context, and it could damage trust. The author might have overstepped by not approaching the buddy privately first or considering how the wife would handle the information.\n\nAlso, the author's history of not acting before adds to the question of their responsibility. If they had known for a year and took no action, then suddenly calling it out in an argument might look more like a personal attack than a responsible intervention.\n\nIn terms of social norms, confronting someone with a partner's infidelity in front of the spouse is usually considered a bad move. It can cause immediate emotional distress and may not be the right way to handle it. Even if the intent was good, the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author's action was in the wrong because they chose an inconsiderate and confrontational way to address the issue, especially during an argument, using it as a retaliation rather than a sincere effort to help. The context might mitigate some blame, but the manner and timing were poor, making the author at fault.\n"
