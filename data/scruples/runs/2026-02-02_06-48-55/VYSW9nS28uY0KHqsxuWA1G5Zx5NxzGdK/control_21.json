Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. Let me break this down. The author has known their friend since middle school and the friend has a history of cheating, including with his current secretary. The author didn't intervene before, just ignored it. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author, out of anger, tells the friend's wife about the cheating. The question is if the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The friend was cheating, which is clearly wrong. But the author's action was done in the heat of an argument. Was it justified? Well, the author didn't have the friend's consent to share that information. Even if the friend had a history, telling the wife in a public place during a fight might not be the best approach. The key points here are intent and method. The author's intent was to confront the friend, not to help the wife. Public shaming or revealing such a personal issue without considering the consequences could be problematic. Also, the author might not have considered the wife's feelings or the appropriateness of the setting. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior is unethical and harmful. The author might feel that they were doing a good thing by exposing the cheating. However, the manner in which it was done\u2014during an argument and in public\u2014could be seen as harsh and without proper consideration. The author didn't take the time to think about the best way to approach this, leading to a situation where the wife is blindsided in a stressful environment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did act on their emotions. Even though the information is true, revealing it without the friend's knowledge or in a private, more measured setting is generally advised. So the author's action, while aimed at calling out wrongdoing, might be considered inconsiderate and thus the wrong approach. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend cheated, the way the author handled it\u2014publicly during an argument\u2014was not appropriate. They should have handled it privately and thoughtfully, not as a retaliation.\n"
