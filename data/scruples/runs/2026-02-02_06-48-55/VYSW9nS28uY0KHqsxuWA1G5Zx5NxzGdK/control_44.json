Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend has a history of cheating, and the person knew about the current affair with the secretary. They kept quiet before, but during an argument, they blurted it out in front of the wife. The question is whether this is an asshole move despite the context.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the friend was cheating, which is wrong. On the other, bringing it up in front of his wife might cause public embarrassment and could have serious consequences. The person did it out of anger during an argument, which might mean they weren't thinking about the repercussions. \n\nBut the user argues that context changes things. They had a history of keeping quiet, so maybe there's some justification. However, the method of confrontation is important. Even if the friend is cheating, confronting him in front of his wife during an argument might be seen as tactless. The wife deserves to know, but the way it's done matters. \n\nThe user might think they did the right thing by exposing the cheating, but the manner could be problematic. It's possible that a more private and calm discussion would have been better. The fact that it was done in anger suggests a lack of judgment, which could make the action seem more like an asshole move.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the timing and method of confrontation were inappropriate, even if the intent was to reveal the truth. Alternatively, if the cheating is ongoing and the author felt compelled to act, maybe B is possible. But the public and angry context likely tips it towards A.\n"
