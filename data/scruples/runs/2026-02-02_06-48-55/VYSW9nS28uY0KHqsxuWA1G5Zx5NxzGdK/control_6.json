Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has a history of cheating, and the person knew about it but said nothing until an argument led them to blurt it out in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person wasn't involved in the relationship, just a friend. They\u2019ve known about the cheating for a while, maybe even encouraged by the friend's bragging. The key point here is the timing and the manner in which the accusation was made. The user didn't approach the wife privately to discuss it but instead brought it up during an argument, which could be seen as using a personal attack in a heated moment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between telling someone's partner about their infidelity and doing it in the wrong context. Usually, such revelations are sensitive and require discretion. However, the user's intent was to retaliate during an argument rather than to protect the wife. This could be seen as using the information as a weapon, which is unkind and potentially harmful.\n\nBut then there's the context of the friend's repeated cheating. The user might believe that the friend's behavior is unacceptable and that the wife deserved to know. However, the method of delivery\u2014during an argument in a public place\u2014could exacerbate the situation and cause unnecessary pain. The user's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the information is true.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing in terms of defamation unless the statement is false, but the question is about moral responsibility. The user's action disrupted the relationship between the friend and his wife, which could have serious consequences. Even if the user's intention was to expose the cheating, doing so in front of the wife without a private conversation first might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user had knowledge of the cheating and might have a point about the friend's behavior, the way they chose to disclose it\u2014publicly and out of anger\u2014could be seen as an asshole move. The context of a personal argument might make their action more about retaliation than genuine concern for the wife's well-being. So the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
