Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person wrote about their friend who's been a serial cheater for years. They knew about the cheating with the secretary and stayed silent before, thinking it's not their problem. Then, during an argument at a brewery, they blurted out \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" in front of the wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author has known about the cheating for a long time but never told the wife before. This time, they did it out of anger during an argument. The key points here are intent, the method of disclosure, and the relationship between the people involved.\n\nTelling someone they're being cheated on is a sensitive issue. Normally, if someone finds out about cheating, they should probably approach it with care. But here, the author didn't do it privately; they did it in front of the wife during an argument. That's probably not a good way to handle it. Even if the intent was to expose the cheating, the method was confrontational and potentially humiliating in public. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the friend was throwing \"low blows\" and they were angry. So it was a reaction rather than a premeditated, thoughtful action. But even if the situation was heated, is it ever okay to publicly call someone out like that? Maybe the right thing would have been to talk to the wife privately or to not say anything at all if they didn't want to be involved.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the context (like the friend's repeated cheating and the author's prior inaction) changes the equation. But in most cases, airing someone else's private issues in public is generally frowned upon, regardless of the truth. Even if the information is true, the way it's delivered matters. The author's action could have caused unnecessary harm, especially since the wife was present. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be seen as trying to do the right thing by exposing the cheating, but the method was inappropriate. However, some people might argue that if the friend was a serial cheater, the author had a duty to tell the wife eventually. But again, the timing and the public nature of the revelation are problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action was unkind and unprofessional, even if the intent was to stop the cheating. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
