Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-time friend who's known for cheating, specifically with his secretary. The author didn't say anything before but finally called him out in front of his wife during an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known about the cheating for a year but chose not to act until now. The argument was escalating, and in a moment of anger, they made the comment. The key issue here is the method and timing of revealing the infidelity. \n\nTelling someone's spouse about an affair is generally a sensitive matter. Even though the friend was a cheater, doing it in a public setting during an argument, especially out of anger, might not be the best approach. The author's intention was to retaliate with a low blow, which suggests it was more about getting back at their friend than genuinely helping his wife. \n\nHowever, the content of the accusation is true. The friend was indeed cheating. So, while the truth is on the author's side, the way it was delivered could be problematic. The question is whether the context (the argument and the friend's cheating history) justifies the action.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to expose the cheating, which is a serious issue. On the other, doing it in a heated argument in front of others, especially the wife, might have caused unnecessary harm without a constructive approach. The author didn't approach the wife privately or provide evidence, just made an accusation in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt's important to weigh the intent and the impact. The intent was to hurt the friend back, which could be seen as using the cheating revelation as a weapon in an argument. The impact is that the wife now knows about the infidelity, which could lead to significant personal and relational consequences. \n\nBut the user already stated that telling someone they're being cheated on isn't an asshole move. However, the context might change that. If the author had a valid reason and presented it responsibly, maybe it's different. Here, it seems like the author acted impulsively, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the information was true.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because the method was careless and vindictive, despite the truth. The answer should be A.\n"
