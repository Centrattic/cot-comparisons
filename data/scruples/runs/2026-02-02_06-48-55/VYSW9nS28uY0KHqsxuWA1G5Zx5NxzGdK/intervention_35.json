Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is that the author has known their friend since middle school and the friend has a history of cheating, specifically with his secretary. The author has kept quiet about it until now. During an argument at a brewery, the author yells at their friend in front of his wife, accusing him of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The friend was cheating, and the author chose to confront him publicly during an argument. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I understand, the friend was already cheating, and the author had the information. The author didn't tell the wife before, but in the heat of the moment, they did. So the act of revealing the infidelity in front of the wife is a big deal. Normally, telling someone's partner about their cheating could be seen as right because it's the truth. But the context here is important: it was done in the middle of an argument out of anger, not calmly. \n\nAlso, the author had previously stayed silent, which might indicate that they weren't fully committed to the idea of exposing the friend. The method here was confrontational and public. Even though the wife might find out eventually, the way the author did it could be hurtful and unkind. \n\nOn one hand, the truth is being told and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, the manner in which it's revealed\u2014during an argument, in a public place, and out of anger\u2014could be considered insensitive. The author might be seen as using the accusation as a weapon in the argument rather than a genuine concern for the wife. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective, if the intention was to help the wife, then maybe not wrong. But if it's just an angry outburst during an argument, that's more likely to be seen as wrong. The fact that the author had kept quiet all this time suggests that maybe they didn't think it was their place to intervene, so suddenly doing so in a heated moment could come off as hypocritical or manipulative. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the context of the argument and the public setting, combined with the prior silence, makes the action seem more like a spiteful act than a genuine attempt to help. However, there's a counter-argument that the truth should be told regardless. But in most cases, people would frown upon using such a personal revelation during an argument, especially if it's done out of anger rather than concern.\n"
