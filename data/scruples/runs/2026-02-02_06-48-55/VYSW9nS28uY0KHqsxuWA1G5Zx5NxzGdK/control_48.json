Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person called out their friend for cheating in front of the friend's wife. The friend is a serial cheater, and the author knew about this for a year but never said anything before. The argument started when the friend was being a jerk, and in the heat of the moment, the author blurted it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved. Cheating is a serious issue, and exposing someone's infidelity can have big consequences. The author's intention was to call out the friend's cheating, but they did it publicly and in front of his wife. Even though the friend is a serial cheater, the method of confronting the issue matters. \n\nThe author didn't approach the wife privately first. Instead, they made the accusation in front of others, which could be seen as airing someone's dirty laundry publicly. Even if the author believed the friend's actions were wrong, the way of revealing it might be problematic. The context includes that the friend was being argumentative, leading to the outburst. But does that justify the public confrontation?\n\nOn one hand, the author is pointing out a betrayal that the friend's wife might not know about, which could be seen as a good deed. On the other hand, doing it in front of others without considering the consequences might be hurtful and inappropriate. The author's approach might have been impulsive and not the best way to handle the situation, regardless of the friend's past behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's history of not saying anything before might mean they didn't give the friend a chance to address it privately. So, even if the intent was to help, the method could be flawed. The question is whether the context (the argument, the friend's cheating history) changes the wrongness of the action. \n\nIn some perspectives, if someone is in a harmful relationship, exposing the truth could be necessary. However, the public manner and the fact that it was done in the middle of an argument might make it an asshole move regardless. The key factors here are intent versus method. The author's intent was to reveal the truth, but the method was confrontational and public, which can be seen as crossing a line.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on whether the method overrides the intent. If the method is inappropriate, the author could be in the wrong even if the intent was good. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because revealing such sensitive information in public, even if justified, can be seen as an asshole move due to the context of the confrontation and the lack of a private approach.\n"
