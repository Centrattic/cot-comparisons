Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The context is important here.\n\nFirst, the friend has been a serial cheater, bragging about cheating with his secretary. The author has known about this for a year but stayed silent before. This time, during an argument, the author blurts out the accusation in front of the wife. \n\nThe key points are: the author's previous inaction vs. the sudden public accusation. Even though the friend was cheating, the author didn't confront the friend privately first. Instead, they chose to reveal it during an argument in front of his wife. That's a big deal because it's a public humiliation. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. Even if the friend was cheating, the author's approach was confrontational and public. Telling someone's spouse about an affair isn't inherently wrong, but the timing and the manner matter. \n\nThe author might argue that the friend deserved it after being a serial cheater and that the wife had a right to know. However, the fact that it was done out of anger during an argument, rather than a calm, private conversation, could be seen as reckless. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have had good intentions, but the method was poor. The context of the friend's past behavior could mitigate some blame, but the act of publically shaming during an argument still crosses a line. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, the usual advice is to approach the person privately. The author didn't do that. So even if the truth is important, the delivery affects the outcome. The wife might have been hurt by the public exposure, and the argument likely escalated because of it. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they chose to confront the issue, regardless of the truth. The answer would be A.\n"
