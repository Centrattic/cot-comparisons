Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a lifelong friend who's been cheating multiple times. The friend is currently cheating on his wife with the secretary. The author knows about this because the friend brags about it. Up until now, the author hasn't said anything to the wife or others involved, just letting it be someone else's problem.\n\nThen, during an argument at a brewery, the author gets angry and calls out the friend in front of his wife. The author says, \"At least I'm not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" when his wife is sitting right there. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this, even though the friend is a serial cheater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author knew about the cheating for a while but never told anyone before. This time, it happened in a public place with the wife present. The argument started because the friend was throwing low blows, leading the author to retaliate with the cheating accusation.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is cheating, so the author is pointing out the truth. But on the other hand, the author is revealing this information publicly and in a confrontational manner, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the information is true, the way it's delivered might be harmful and could damage relationships.\n\nThe key factors here might be intent and the method. The author's intent was to retaliate in anger rather than to help the wife. Publicly shaming someone with such a sensitive issue can cause significant emotional harm. Even though the friend is cheating, the author's actions might be considered inappropriate because they were done in a moment of anger during an argument, not a constructive conversation.\n\nAnother angle is the author's previous inaction. By not telling the wife before, they might have been complicit in a way, and then suddenly bringing it up in an argument could seem like a betrayal or a power move rather than a genuine concern for the wife.\n\nSo, while the cheating is wrong, the method and context in which the author revealed it might make them the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
