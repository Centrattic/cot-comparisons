Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who's been cheating for a long time, specifically with his secretary. The author knew about it but didn't say anything before. Now, during an argument at a brewery, the author yells at the friend in front of his wife, accusing him of cheating. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known about the cheating for a year and the friend brags about it. The author didn't intervene before, choosing to stay out of it. Then, during an argument, the author lashes out in anger. The key points here are the timing and the method of calling out the cheating.\n\nTelling someone's spouse about an infidelity is a big deal. Normally, that's considered a serious breach of trust and could be seen as a violation of privacy. But in this case, the author was already aware of the cheating for a long time and chose not to say anything until an argument happened in front of the wife. The argument led to a raised voice and a public accusation. \n\nThe user is asking if the context changes the morality of the act. Even if the friend was a serial cheater, bringing it up in the heat of an argument might be seen as using a low blow to win an argument, rather than a genuine attempt to help. Publicly shaming someone in front of their spouse could cause significant emotional harm and might not be justified, even if the information is true. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were finally fed up and that the friend deserved to be called out. But the fact that it was done in a public place and during an argument might make it worse. The author's decision to wait until a confrontation rather than approaching the friend privately could be a factor. Also, the method of disclosure could have consequences for the friend's marriage and the author's relationship with both the friend and the wife.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's intention was to expose the cheating, the way and timing might make it an asshole move. The context (knowing about it for a long time, using it as a weapon in an argument) might not excuse the action. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
