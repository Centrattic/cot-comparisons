Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for confronting their friend about cheating in front of the friend's wife.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has known their friend since middle school. The friend is a serial cheater, currently cheating with his secretary. The author kept quiet before, letting it be \"not their problem.\" Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author calls out the friend in front of his wife. The key here is the method and timing of the confrontation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to do the right thing by exposing the cheating. Cheating is a serious issue, and the wife has a right to know. But the author did it in a public, emotional moment during an argument. That could be seen as using a personal attack, which might escalate conflict and be cruel. The question is whether the method was appropriate despite the noble intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a history of cheating and bragged about it. The author might feel justified in stopping the deception. However, confronting someone in the heat of an argument in front of others is generally not advised. It's a public humiliation, which can damage relationships regardless of the truth. Also, the author had the option to approach the wife discreetly instead of making a public accusation. \n\nThe author admits it was an emotional reaction to being hit with low blows. That suggests it was impulsive rather than a calm, considered action. While the intent was good, the method was poor. The wife's right to know is important, but the way it's delivered matters. Public confrontation can be harmful, even if the information is true. The author might have known about the cheating for a long time but chose to wait until an argument to bring it up, which could indicate a lack of discretion.\n\nIn terms of the question's focus: Is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. Even if the content is justified (cheating is wrong), the delivery (publicly during an argument) is inconsiderate and could be seen as an asshole move. The title says \"AITA for calling out my buddy... in front of his wife?\" The community often judges based on intent and method. Here, the method is questionable, so the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
