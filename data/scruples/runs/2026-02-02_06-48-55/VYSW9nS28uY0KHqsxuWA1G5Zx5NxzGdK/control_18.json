Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for calling out their friend's cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has known their friend since middle school. The friend is a serial cheater, currently cheating on his wife with the secretary. The author knew about this but stayed silent before. During an argument at a brewery, the author, out of anger, tells the friend in front of his wife that he's cheating. The author is wondering if this was wrong, considering the context of the friend's past behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had prior knowledge of the cheating, chose not to act before, but in a heated argument, revealed the truth. The question is about the morality of this action.\n\nNow, considering the options between A (Yes, wrong) and B (No, not wrong). \n\nOn one hand, the author is helping the wife by exposing the cheating, which could be seen as a good intention. However, the method was confrontational and done in a public setting during an argument. This could be seen as tactless or even cruel, as it's done in the heat of the moment and might have hurt the wife emotionally. Even if the friend was dishonest, the author's action might have caused unnecessary pain or made the situation worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking responsibility for a friend who's been cheating repeatedly. Maybe the author felt that the wife deserved to know, especially since the friend's behavior was ongoing. However, the timing and the way it was done (in the middle of an argument) might have been inconsiderate. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to call out a friend's infidelity in such a public and confrontational manner. Even if the information is true, the method can be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but the way it was done could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle: the author had previously chosen not to interfere, which allowed the cheating to continue. By finally speaking up, maybe they felt a sense of duty. However, the public confrontation might have been a poor choice, leading to potential embarrassment or distress for the wife. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author's intent matters. If the goal was to help the wife, then it's a good deed. But if it was done out of spite during an argument, then it's a bad move. The post says the author was acting out of anger, which suggests it was impulsive rather than a well-considered action. Impulsiveness in such situations can lead to more harm than good, regardless of the truth.\n\nTherefore, while the content of the message might be valid, the context\u2014being in a heated argument and done publicly\u2014could make the action inappropriate. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the manner in which the truth was revealed, even if the truth itself was something the wife needed to know. The key here is the method and the timing, which could have been handled more sensitively.\n"
