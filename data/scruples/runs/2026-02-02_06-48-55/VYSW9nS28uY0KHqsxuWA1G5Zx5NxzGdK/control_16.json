Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: They've known each other since middle school, so there's a long history. The friend is a serial cheater, and the author knew about the affair with the secretary but didn't say anything before. Now, during an argument at a brewery, the author confronts him in front of his wife with an angry remark.\n\nThe key points here are the timing, intent, and the method. The author admits they were acting out of anger during an escalating argument. The main question is whether revealing the cheating in front of the wife was wrong, considering the context.\n\nOn one hand, the act of exposing a betrayal can be seen as a betrayal itself, especially if done without the person's consent. Even if the information is true, doing it in the heat of an argument might be seen as cruel or manipulative. The author's previous inaction suggests they didn't see it as their business before, which could imply they didn't have the right to suddenly act as a moral arbiter in the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend's cheating is wrong, and the author felt compelled to confront him. However, the method\u2014doing it publicly and in a heated argument\u2014could have caused unnecessary harm. The wife might not have wanted to hear it from a mutual friend in such a setting, and it could damage relationships regardless of the truth.\n\nThe user's own question hints at the context possibly changing the judgment, but the core action of revealing a private matter without considering the consequences might still be problematic. The author might be seen as overstepping their role, especially since they didn't address it before and did so in a confrontational way.\n"
