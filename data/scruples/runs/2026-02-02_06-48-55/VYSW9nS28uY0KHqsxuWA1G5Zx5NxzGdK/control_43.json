Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has known their friend since middle school. The friend has a history of cheating, specifically with his secretary. The author knew about this but stayed silent before. During an argument at a brewery, the author yells the accusation in front of the friend's wife.\n\nThe key points here are the context and the method. The author claims they did this out of anger during an escalating argument. The question is whether the context (longtime friend, prior knowledge, emotional response) justifies the action of publicly confronting the friend in front of his wife.\n\nIn relationships, especially friendships, confronting someone about cheating is sensitive. Normally, advising someone to tell the spouse is often considered right because infidelity is a serious betrayal. However, the method here is important. The author didn't approach this privately or with care; instead, it was a public outburst during an argument. Even if the truth is there, the delivery can affect the judgment.\n\nThe user might be considering if the author overstepped by not handling it privately, especially since they had the information for a while. Publicly shaming someone, even if the accusation is true, can be seen as harsh and potentially damaging. The author's motivation (anger) might also be a factor, as it could have been an emotional reaction rather than a measured decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the truth of the situation is that the friend was cheating, and the author might feel they had a duty to protect the wife. But the method of confrontation can be problematic. Whether the author is in the wrong might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, handling such sensitive information in a private, respectful manner is advised.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was inappropriate, even if the content was justified. They didn't handle it in a way that minimizes harm or respects the situation's sensitivity.\n"
