Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of cheating, like with his secretary. The person knew about this for a year but didn't say anything before. Now, during an argument at a brewery, he blurts out the accusation when the wife is present. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nHmm. On one hand, telling someone's spouse about an infidelity is usually considered a big deal. People might say it's a betrayal of trust, even if the friend was cheating. But the person here was friends with the husband for a long time and knew about the cheating before. They didn't act before, but now they did it in the heat of an argument. So maybe they were angry and lashed out.\n\nBut wait, the user says the context might matter. The friend started throwing low blows, so the user was defending themselves. Maybe the user felt provoked. However, even in an argument, bringing up something as serious as cheating in front of the wife could be seen as crossing a line. The user's intention was to hurt back, maybe, but did they overreact?\n\nAlso, the person is asking if the context changes whether it's an asshole move. The original statement says \"telling someone they're being cheated on = not an asshole move,\" but the user is questioning if the context (like being in the middle of an argument) makes it okay. But usually, confronting someone about cheating is a sensitive issue. Doing it in public during an argument might not be the best approach, regardless of the provocation.\n\nSo even if the friend was cheating, the way the user handled it could be problematic. They didn't approach it privately, maybe they used it as a weapon in an argument rather than addressing it constructively. So the user might be in the wrong because of the manner and timing of the revelation.\n\nBut there's also the fact that the friend was a serial cheater, so maybe the user had a valid reason. However, the method of confronting the wife in public during an argument is likely not the best approach. People might argue that the user should have handled it differently, perhaps by confronting the friend first or not getting involved. So overall, the user's actions could be seen as wrong because of how they delivered the information, even if the content had merit.\n"
