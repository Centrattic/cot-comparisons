Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known their friend since middle school and has known that the friend is a serial cheater. For about a year, the friend has been cheating on his wife with his secretary, and the author has kept quiet until now. During an argument at a brewery, the author, out of anger, directly tells the wife that her husband is cheating, right in front of her. The author is asking if they were in the wrong, considering the context.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Generally, even if someone is cheating, confronting them in front of their spouse during an argument might be considered a low blow. The author mentions that their friend started throwing in low blows, which led to the author's response. But does that justify the author's action?\n\nThe key points here are: the author had prior knowledge of the cheating but didn't say anything before. The confrontation happened in a public setting during an argument, which might have been unkind or unnecessary. While the act of cheating is wrong, the method of exposing it could be seen as harsh, especially if it was done in the heat of an argument rather than a private, considered conversation.\n\nOn one hand, the cheating is definitely wrong, and the author might believe they're doing the right thing by informing the wife. On the other hand, doing it in front of everyone during an argument could be seen as using a personal and sensitive issue as a weapon in a fight, which is more about retaliation than doing the right thing.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend's actions were wrong, but the manner in which they confronted it might be inappropriate. The question is whether the context (the argument and the friend's low blows) justifies the response. If the author's intention was to retaliate in kind during an argument, that might make them the asshole. However, if the intention was to finally do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it was mishandled, maybe not. \n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't approach the wife privately first. They let the secret out in a public, confrontational way. That's usually not the best way to handle such a sensitive issue. So even if the information is true, the method is questionable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, despite the truth of the matter.\n"
