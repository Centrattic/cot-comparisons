Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The friend is a serial cheater, and the author had known about the cheating for a while but didn't say anything before. The argument happened at a brewery, and the author said the comment out of anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The main point is whether calling out someone's infidelity in front of their spouse is an asshole move, even if the friend is a cheater. The user provided their own opinion that the author is in the wrong but wants my thoughts.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intent, context, and consequences. The author's intent was to retaliate in an argument out of anger, not to protect the wife. Even though the truth was revealed, the method was confrontational and public. The wife was present, so the comment directly affected her. Even if the friend is a cheater, the author's approach could be seen as crossing a line. The author had not intervened before, so this sudden public accusation might be seen as a breach of trust or a harmful act. The question is whether the context (the friend being a serial cheater) excuses the method. However, most people would argue that regardless of the truth, the way it was delivered was inappropriate. The author's action caused emotional distress to both the friend and the wife, even if the truth was necessary. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
