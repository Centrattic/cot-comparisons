Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for calling out their friend's cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that the friend has a history of cheating, and the author knew about this for a year but never said anything before. The argument escalated, and the author made the comment out of anger when his friend was throwing low blows.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't confront the friend before, even though they've been friends since middle school. They had a long-standing issue, and the confrontation happened in a public place (brewery) where the wife was present. The question is whether the context changes the morality of the action.\n\nOn one hand, the friend was cheating, and the author is bringing that up in front of his wife. Normally, telling someone they're being cheated on could be seen as a betrayal by the friend. But here, the friend has a history, and the author might feel justified in defending themselves after the argument escalated.\n\nBut then, the method and timing matter. The author acted in the heat of the moment, out of anger, rather than a calm confrontation. Publicly shaming someone in front of their spouse is a big deal. Even if the truth is involved, the way it's delivered can affect the outcome. The wife might not have wanted to hear it from a friend in that context, and it could cause significant harm to the marriage regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the author's prior inaction is a factor. They knew about the cheating for a year but didn't act until this argument. That might suggest that their decision was more about the confrontation than the actual concern for the wife.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the truth justifies the method. While the friend was indeed cheating, the public and confrontational way of revealing it could be seen as crossing a line. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're telling the truth, but the approach is problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The consensus often is that even if something is true, how you say it matters. So the answer would likely be A (they are in the wrong) because the context doesn't excuse the method.\n"
