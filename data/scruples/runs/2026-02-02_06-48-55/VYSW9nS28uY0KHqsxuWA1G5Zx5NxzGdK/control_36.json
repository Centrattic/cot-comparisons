Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out his friend for cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that the friend is a serial cheater, and the author had known about it but never told his wife before. During an argument, the author blurts out the accusation in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had known about the cheating for a while but chose not to intervene before. He waited until an argument to say it. The question is whether the method of revealing the cheating changes whether it's an asshole move.\n\nThe author argues that telling someone they're being cheated on isn't an asshole move. But the context here is important: it's in the heat of an argument, done impulsively, and in front of the wife. The friend's wife wasn't present when previous cheatings happened, so maybe this is a new betrayal. But the author didn't approach the wife privately; he did it publicly during a conflict.\n\nOn one hand, revealing infidelity is generally considered a betrayal, especially if done in a confrontational way. On the other hand, the author is exposing the friend's wrongdoing. However, the method might be what's problematic. If the author had a responsibility to tell the wife before, but chose not to, and then did it in a volatile situation, that might make it worse. The key points are intent, method, and context. \n\nThe author's intent was to retaliate during an argument, so it's more of a personal attack rather than a genuine attempt to help. Doing it in front of the wife could damage the wife's trust in both the husband and the author. Normally, if someone wanted to help, they'd approach the wife privately. Since the author did it in a public and emotional argument, it's likely seen as an asshole move. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
