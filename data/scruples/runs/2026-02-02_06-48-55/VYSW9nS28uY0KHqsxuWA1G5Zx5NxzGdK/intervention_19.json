Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The author knew about the cheating for a year, kept quiet before, and then during an argument, said it in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The friend was cheating, which is wrong. The author didn't tell the wife before, maybe to avoid conflict. But then, during an argument, they said it in a heated moment. \n\nIs this the right time to confront? Usually, such revelations can be very hurtful. Even if the truth is important, the method matters. Doing it in a public place during an argument might be seen as cruel or thoughtless. The author might have good intentions, but the timing and setting could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author says \"not my life, not my problem\" before, so maybe they were passive. Then, out of anger, they snapped. So maybe the motivation was revenge or retaliation during an argument, not a genuine concern for the wife. That could make the action worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife deserves to know. But the way it's done is important. Confronting someone in a public argument isn't the best approach. The author might be right in the content (cheating is wrong), but the delivery is wrong. So the author could be in the wrong because of the method, even if the act of revealing the truth is justified.\n\nBut some might argue that the friend needed to know, and the author was doing the right thing. However, the context of an argument and public place likely makes it an asshole move. So the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
