Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been cheating for a while, bragging about it, and the author has kept quiet until now. They had an argument at a brewery, and in the heat of the moment, the author revealed the cheating to the wife. The main question is whether this context makes the action justified or not.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the context of the situation. The author mentions that they did it out of anger during an argument. They didn't plan it; it was a reaction to the friend's low blows. The friend had a history of cheating, so the author might feel justified in exposing the truth now that it's come to a head. \n\nBut traditionally, calling someone out in front of their wife could be seen as confrontational and possibly hurtful, even if the information is true. However, the fact that the friend was a serial cheater and the author had been a passive witness might make people see it as a necessary action to protect the wife from being cheated on. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for who is the asshole in the situation. The user is asking if the action was wrong given the context. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nConsidering that the author's intent was to stop the cheating and the friend had been bragging about it, maybe the author's action isn't entirely wrong. People might view it as standing up for the wife, especially since the husband was the one starting the argument with personal attacks. The author acted in the moment, which could be seen as a reaction to being provoked. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it privately first or not at all, even if they were angry. But given the context of the argument and the friend's history, the author's action might be seen as justified. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the information was true, and the context of the argument and the friend's cheating history supports the author's decision to speak up in that moment. The wife deserves to know the truth, and the author's anger was a response to the friend's provocations. So, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
