Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has known the friend since middle school. The friend has a history of cheating, specifically mentioned with his secretary. The author knew about this cheating for a year and chose not to say anything before. Now, after an argument at a brewery where the author was upset, they blurted out the accusation in front of the friend's wife. The key points here are the context of the argument, the fact that the author knew about the cheating beforehand, and the manner in which the accusation was made.\n\nThe user asks if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, bringing up a cheating accusation in front of the wife during an argument could be seen as harsh. Even if the information is true, the way it's delivered might be considered tactless or cruel. The author didn't approach the wife privately first, which might be the more considerate method. Also, since the friend had a history of cheating, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing by exposing the infidelity. However, the method of public confrontation without warning could cause immediate emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had prior knowledge and chose not to act before. The argument might have been the trigger, and the friend's low blows led the author to retaliate. The line \"not my life, not my problem\" suggests the author wasn't previously involved. By speaking up, the author might be trying to prevent further harm to the wife. But making it public during an argument could be seen as using the truth as a weapon, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, how information is revealed matters a lot. Telling someone's spouse about their cheating is a serious matter. If done privately, it's one thing, but doing it publicly and in the heat of an argument could be seen as insensitive. The author's action might be justified in intent but not in execution. So, the context might mitigate the wrongness, but the method is questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the way they revealed the truth was inappropriate, even if the truth was valid.\n"
