Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by confronting his friend about cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that the friend has a history of cheating, and the author knew about it but never told his wife before. This time, during an argument at a brewery, the author called out the friend in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had prior knowledge of the cheating, chose not to intervene before, and then in a moment of anger during an argument, revealed it publicly. The question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the context matters. Even though the friend cheated, the method of revealing it was in a heated argument and in front of his wife. That could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the friend didn't keep it secret. However, the friend did brag about it, so maybe the author thought it was justified.\n\nBut regardless of the friend's behavior, confronting him in front of his wife during an argument could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by stopping the cheating, but the timing and manner could have been unkind. The wife has a right to know, but the way it's delivered matters. Public humiliation, especially in the middle of an argument, can be hurtful and inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author didn't approach the friend privately first to discuss it. Maybe a private conversation would have been better. Since the author had known about the cheating for a while but didn't act until an argument, it might look like revenge or a spiteful act. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend kept cheating, and the author might have felt the wife deserved to know. But the method of telling her in front of others could be problematic. So, even if the intent was good, the execution was bad. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they chose the wrong time and place to reveal sensitive information, causing public embarrassment during a conflict.\n"
