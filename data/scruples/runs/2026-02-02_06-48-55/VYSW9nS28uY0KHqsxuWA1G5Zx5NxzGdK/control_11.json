Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend's cheating in front of his wife. The situation involves a long-time friend known for cheating, and the author finally confronts him during an argument.\n\nFirst, the author didn't tell the wife before. They kept it to themselves, thinking it wasn't their problem. But during an argument, they blurt out the truth when the wife is present. The key points here are the context of the argument, the fact that the cheating was boasted about, and the impact on the wife.\n\nThe question is whether calling someone out in public during a heated moment is acceptable. On one hand, cheating is a serious issue, and the author is addressing a betrayal. But doing it in front of the wife and in the heat of an argument might be seen as harsh and potentially damaging to the friendship. The wife might not know how to handle the situation, and the author's timing could be questionable.\n\nHowever, the friend had a history of cheating and bragging about it. The author might feel justified in confronting him, especially if they've been complicit before. The main issue is whether the method (public confrontation during an argument) is appropriate. Even if the truth is good, the delivery matters. It's possible that the author intended to protect the wife by revealing the truth, but the manner could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't in the wrong because the cheating was real, but the way they did it might be seen as tactless. However, since the wife was present and the context was an argument, others might argue the author crossed a line. But given that the friend was a serial cheat and the author was acting out of anger, maybe the answer leans towards not being the author's fault. But I need to consider if the public call-out is a betrayal of trust or if it's justified. The user's title says \"AITA for calling out my buddy for cheating, in front of his wife?\" So the act of telling the wife directly in front of her husband\u2014usually, that's a tough spot. But since the husband was bragging, maybe the author had a right to speak up. However, timing and method are crucial. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the cheating was real, but the situation is messy. Alternatively, maybe A if the method was inappropriate. But the user's own question hints that the context might matter. Since the husband was cheating repeatedly and the author was just reacting in anger, maybe the answer is B. Hmm.\n"
