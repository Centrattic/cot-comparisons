Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been cheating multiple times, and the writer finally calls him out in front of his wife after a heated argument. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has a history of cheating, and the writer knew about the current affair with the secretary. They didn't intervene before, just kept it to themselves. The argument happened at a brewery where the writer, in anger, revealed the cheating in front of the wife. The key points here are the context of the argument, the method of disclosure (public vs. private), and the writer's past inaction.\n\nThe writer's main defense is that the friend was a serial cheater and had bragged about it. So they might argue that they were just doing the right thing. But the issue is that they told the wife in front of others, which is public and could be seen as harsh. Normally, confronting someone about cheating is a sensitive matter. Even if the person is a cheater, doing it in a public setting where the spouse is present might be considered tactless or a betrayal of trust, especially if the writer was the one who was supposed to be a friend.\n\nAlso, the fact that the writer didn't tell the wife before raises questions. They said it's \"not my life, not my problem,\" implying they weren't concerned. But then, in a moment of anger, they decide to act. That sudden change in behavior might come off as insincere or opportunistic. The wife might feel blindsided, even if the information is true, because the timing and setting were inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the method of calling out the cheating. If the writer had chosen a more private and respectful way to approach it, maybe it would be different. But doing it in front of others during an argument is likely to cause embarrassment and could be seen as using the situation to gain the upper hand in the argument rather than genuinely caring about the wife.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the context changes that. The context here includes the friend's serial cheating, but the manner of disclosure is still problematic. Even if the friend deserved it, the way it was handled might be what's considered an asshole move. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because of the public confrontation and the timing during an argument rather than a genuine concern for the wife's well-being.\n"
