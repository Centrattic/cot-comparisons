Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's long-time friend has been cheating multiple times, including currently with his secretary. The author knew about this but didn't say anything before. Now, during an argument at a brewery, the author yells that the friend is cheating on his wife in front of the wife herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a serial cheater, and the author has been aware for a long time. The author didn't act before, maybe because they thought it wasn't their problem. But in the heat of an argument, they blurt it out. \n\nNow, the question is whether this was a wrong move. On one hand, telling someone they're being cheated on is normally a good deed, but here it's done in a confrontational setting and in front of the wife. The method might be questionable. Even if the intent is to expose the cheating, doing it during an argument and in a public place could be seen as reckless. The author's action might have caused harm to the friend's marriage, possibly leading to a breakup or other consequences. \n\nBut then again, the friend was a cheater, and maybe the wife deserved to know. However, the author's approach was to call it out in the middle of an argument, not a private, calm conversation. The timing and manner matter. The author might have been acting out of anger rather than a genuine desire to help. \n\nSo, the key points are: intent, method, and context. If the intent was to help the wife, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe it's a mix. However, the fact that it was done in front of the wife during a heated argument suggests that it was done impulsively, not thoughtfully. \n\nIn such cases, people often consider the rightness of the action based on the method, not just the outcome. Even if the truth is revealed, the way it's done can be harmful. So the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, despite the truth of the accusation. \n\nBut some might argue that the friend was a cheater and the wife had a right to know, so the author's action was justified. However, the method is usually important. So the answer might depend on the context, but given that it was done in anger during an argument in public, it's likely the author is in the wrong.\n"
