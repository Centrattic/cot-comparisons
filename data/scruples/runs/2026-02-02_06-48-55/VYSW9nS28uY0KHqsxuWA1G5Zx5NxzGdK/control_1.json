Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has known their friend since middle school and the friend has a history of cheating. The author knew about the current affair with the secretary but stayed silent before. The argument at the brewery led to the author blurting out the accusation in front of the wife.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. The key points here are the context of their long-term friendship, the friend's pattern of behavior, and the author's sudden decision to confront the wife during an argument. \n\nOn one hand, the author chose to stay out of it before, which might suggest they didn't want to interfere. But the situation escalated into a heated argument where the author's comment was made impulsively, possibly out of anger. The context here is crucial. The friend had a history of cheating, and the author knew about it but hadn't told his wife before. \n\nNow, in general, accusing someone of cheating in front of their partner isn't typically advised. It can cause immediate harm and trust issues. However, the context matters. The author's friend wasn't being discreet, and the author had been aware for a while. The argument might have pushed the author to say something out of frustration. \n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't approach this calmly or confidentially. Confronting someone's partner in a public setting during an argument isn't the best method. Even if the accusation is true, the way it's delivered can be seen as irresponsible. The wife might not trust the author's motives, especially coming from a friend who didn't speak up before. \n\nHowever, the author's intention might have been to stop the cheating. But the method was unwise. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of the way they handled it, even if the context adds some nuance. The timing and manner of the confrontation are problematic.\n"
