Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife was in the wrong. The key points here are the long-standing friendship, the fact that the friend has been a serial cheater, and the context of the argument.\n\nFirst, the author knew about the cheating for a long time but didn't say anything before. Now, during an argument, they blurt it out in front of the wife. The main issue here is whether the method of confronting the friend was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they were justified because the friend was being a jerk. But on the other hand, bringing up such a sensitive issue in public and during an argument could be seen as harsh. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just if the timing was good.\n\nThe context matters. The friend was cheating, and the author had a history of staying silent. This public confrontation might have been a way to finally address it. But doing it in front of the wife during an argument could have caused unnecessary harm. The author's intent was to call out the cheating, which is a valid concern, but the method might be seen as confrontational and lacking tact.\n\nHowever, if the friend deserved to be called out, maybe the author had a point. But the public nature and the heat of the argument could make it more about retaliation than a genuine effort to help. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more privately, but the context of the cheating and the friend's behavior adds nuance. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the public and emotional context.\n"
