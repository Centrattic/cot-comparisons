Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for confronting his friend about cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has known his friend since middle school. The friend has a history of cheating, specifically with his secretary, which the author has known about but hasn't told the wife before. Now, during an argument at a brewery with the wife present, the author accuses his friend of cheating in front of his wife.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Now I need to evaluate that. \n\nSo, the key points here. The author had prior knowledge of the cheating but chose not to act before. Now he confronts the friend in front of his wife. The main question is whether this action is justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, telling someone they're being cheated on is generally considered a justified action. But the context matters. The author waited until an argument to bring it up, and did so out of anger. The fact that the wife was present adds another layer. The author's friend had a history of cheating, so maybe the author felt it was necessary. But doing it in the heat of an argument, without considering the consequences, could be seen as reckless.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't approach this privately first. Even though he knew, he waited until a public confrontation to reveal it. The wife's presence means the friend's trust is broken, but the author's method of communication might have been inappropriate. The friend might have been given a chance to address it privately if the author had approached him first.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was anger. The argument started with the friend throwing low blows, and the author's response was impulsive. This could be seen as using the cheating revelation as a weapon in an argument rather than a genuine concern for the wife.\n\nBut then again, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. The author might have thought that by telling her, he's doing the right thing, but the way he did it was inconsiderate and possibly hurtful. The fact that the author had known for a long time but didn't act until now might also imply that his timing was poor.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation carefully, used the information during a fight, and didn't consider the impact on both his friend and the wife. Even though the truth is important, the method and timing were inappropriate. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
