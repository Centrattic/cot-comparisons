Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The friend has a history of cheating, and the writer has known about it for a while but never said anything before. The argument escalated, and in a moment of anger, the writer blurted out the accusation in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer has known about the cheating for a long time but chose not to interfere before. Now, during an argument, they confront the friend in a public place with his wife present. Even though the friend is a serial cheater, the way the information is revealed matters. \n\nAccusing someone of cheating in front of their spouse, even if it's true, can be hurtful and potentially damaging. The writer might have had the intention to stop the cheating, but the method was confrontational and public. The wife might not appreciate finding out about her husband's infidelity from a friend rather than from him directly. Also, the timing during an argument might not be the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer might believe they're doing the right thing by exposing the truth. However, the way it was done\u2014out of anger and publicly\u2014could be seen as irresponsible. The writer should have considered the consequences for the wife and the relationship dynamics. Maybe a private conversation would have been more appropriate. \n\nSo, even though the friend's actions are wrong, the writer's approach might be inconsiderate. The key factors are the public confrontation and the emotional state (anger) during which the accusation was made. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because the method of confrontation was inappropriate despite the truth.\n"
