Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author has known their friend since middle school. The friend has a history of cheating, including currently with his secretary. The author has kept quiet about it before, not telling the wife or previous partners. But during an argument at a brewery, the author, out of anger, calls out the friend in front of his wife, saying something like \"At least I'm not banging the secretary behind my wife's back.\" Now the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here: the friend is cheating, the author knows but didn't tell before, and then in a heated argument, they reveal the cheating in front of his wife. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author didn't confront the friend before. They just let it be, maybe thinking it's not their problem. But during an argument, they lash out with a personal attack. Now, even though the friend is cheating, the author's method of confronting it might be inappropriate. \n\nCalling someone out in front of their spouse during an argument is pretty harsh. It's not a private conversation; it's in front of others. The wife might be hurt or shocked, and it could damage the author's relationship with both the friend and the wife. Even if the cheater deserves it, the way the author chooses to reveal it is confrontational and in a public setting, which is not a good approach. \n\nAlso, the author says they did it out of anger. That's a key point. Acting out of anger might not be the best time to make important decisions or reveal sensitive information. It can come off as vindictive or as a way to undermine rather than help. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is clearly in the wrong for cheating. The author's intention might have been to stop the cheating, but the method was poor. However, the act of revealing the cheating isn't inherently wrong if it's true. But the context\u2014public confrontation during an argument\u2014makes it problematic. \n\nThe author's previous inaction adds another layer. They didn't step in before, so maybe they feel guilty now for not preventing it. But acting in anger doesn't excuse the action. The wife might be better off knowing, but the author didn't handle it with care. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the truth should be revealed, the way it's done here is inappropriate. The author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it thoughtfully and used it as a weapon during an argument. The answer would be A.\n"
