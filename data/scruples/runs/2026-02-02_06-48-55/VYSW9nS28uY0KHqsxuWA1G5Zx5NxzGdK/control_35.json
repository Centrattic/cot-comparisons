Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that the friend has a history of cheating, and the author knew about the current affair with the secretary. They usually stayed out of it, but in an argument, they blurted it out in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't confront the wife before; they just let it slide. But during an argument, they decided to bring it up. The main issue here is whether this was a justified action or if the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt the wife deserved to know. Cheating is a serious betrayal, and some might argue that the author was doing the right thing by revealing the truth, even if it was done in anger. However, the method here matters. Doing it in the middle of an argument, in front of others, and out of anger could make it seem like a spiteful act rather than a concern for the wife's well-being. \n\nAnother angle is the relationship between the author and the friend. They've known each other for a long time, so maybe the author felt close enough to take that step. But even so, the way they revealed the information was confrontational and possibly unkind. The author's intent here is key. If they were genuinely trying to protect the wife, the timing and manner might still be questionable. If they were just retaliating in the argument, that's more of an asshole move.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's behavior. The friend is a serial cheater, but the author stayed silent before. Now, in a moment of anger, they spoke up. The question is whether the context of the argument justifies the action. Some people might say that the wife has a right to know, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that the author should have handled it more carefully, perhaps by talking to the wife privately first.\n\nIn terms of morality, the act of revealing infidelity can be seen as a positive if it prevents the wife from being deceived. However, the method here was public and confrontational. The author might have caused emotional harm to the friend and possibly the wife, depending on how the wife received the information. If the wife was already aware, then it's unnecessary. If she wasn't, it's a tough situation either way.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's prior silence, the context of an argument, the public nature of the accusation, and the intent behind it. While the truth might be important, the way it was delivered without considering the impact on all parties involved could make the author in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action was taken in anger and in a public, confrontational manner, even if the content was true. The author didn't handle it responsibly, which could lead to more harm than good.\n"
