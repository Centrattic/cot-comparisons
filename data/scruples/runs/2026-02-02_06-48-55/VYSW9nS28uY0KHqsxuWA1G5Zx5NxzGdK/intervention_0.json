Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that they've known each other since middle school, and the friend has been cheating for a while, specifically with his secretary. The author kept quiet before but in an argument, said it in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend is a serial cheater and has bragged about it. The author stayed silent before, thinking it wasn't their problem. But during an argument, they snapped and revealed the cheating in front of the wife.\n\nNow, the key points here. Is it wrong to tell someone's partner about their infidelity? Generally, if you know someone is cheating, it's a sensitive situation. However, the author didn't approach the wife privately first. They revealed it in the heat of an argument, which might have been done out of anger rather than concern for the wife's well-being.\n\nEven though the friend was cheating, the method of revealing it matters. Telling the wife directly might be necessary if the friend isn't going to stop, but doing it publicly during an argument could be seen as harsh and potentially destructive. The author might have had good intentions, but the timing and manner could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they were angry and used it as a retort. That might make the situation worse because it's more of an attack during a conflict than a responsible disclosure. The wife deserves to know, but the way it was done could have been handled better.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the way they revealed the cheating rather than the act of revealing it itself. The context is important, but the method and timing are questionable. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
