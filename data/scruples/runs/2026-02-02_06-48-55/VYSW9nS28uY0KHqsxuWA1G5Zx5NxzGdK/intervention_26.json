Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has known his friend since middle school. The friend has a history of cheating, specifically with his secretary. The author knew about this for a year but didn't tell the wife or previous girlfriends. The author used to think it's not their problem. \n\nThen, during an argument at a brewery, the author gets angry and calls out the friend in front of his wife, saying something about cheating with the secretary. The question is whether this is an asshole move, considering the context.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's correct. Let's consider the key points.\n\nOn one hand, the author did confront the friend about cheating when it's a sensitive topic. Cheating is a serious issue, and revealing it to the spouse could have major consequences. The author did this in the heat of an argument, which might not be the best time or place. Publicly shaming someone, even if justified, can be hurtful and might not be the right approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a pattern of cheating and was bragging about it. The author had kept this information to themselves for a long time, not intervening before. The argument might have escalated, leading the author to act out of anger. However, the method of revealing it\u2014during a confrontation in a public place with the wife present\u2014is questionable.\n\nEthically, the right thing to do would be to inform the wife, but the manner and timing matter. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by stopping the cheating, but doing it in the middle of an argument without considering the consequences could be seen as reckless. The author didn't handle it privately or with care, which could have caused unnecessary harm.\n\nSo, considering that the author acted out of anger during a public argument rather than approaching the wife privately, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
