Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out his friend for cheating in front of the friend's wife. The author had known about the cheating for years but never said anything before. The argument happened at a brewery, and he said it out of anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known the friend since middle school, so there's a long-standing relationship. The friend is a serial cheater, bragging about it. The author stayed silent before, so maybe he's conflicted about the situation. The key point here is that the author decided to call it out in front of the wife, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust or a private matter.\n\nTelling someone their spouse is cheating is usually a sensitive issue. Even if the person is cheating, the way and timing of the disclosure matter. The author did it during an argument, which was likely not the best time. Also, doing it in public adds another layer of public shaming, which could be hurtful regardless of the truth.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the author is trying to be honest, and the friend's actions are wrong. However, maybe the author should have approached it privately instead of in a heated moment. The fact that the author had kept it to himself for so long and then revealed it in a public argument might suggest that his motivation was more about personal conflict than genuine concern, which could make it an asshole move.\n\nSo, considering the context, the method, and the relationship, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle it privately and did it out of anger during an argument. Even though the truth is on his side, the way he delivered it was inappropriate. So Answer A.\n"
