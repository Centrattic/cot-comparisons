Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has known their friend since middle school. The friend is a serial cheater, and for a year, he's been cheating with his secretary. The author knew about it but didn't say anything before, choosing not to interfere. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author yells at their friend about cheating in front of his wife.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. The user wants a quick A or B answer, but I need to think through it first.\n\nThe key points here are the context and the method of disclosure. The author didn't tell the wife before because they considered it not their problem. However, they did it in a heated argument, out of anger. The question is whether the method of disclosure (public vs. private) and the intent (to confront during an argument) affects the morality of the act.\n\nIn many cases, if someone is being cheated on, informing them is seen as the right thing to do, regardless of the context. However, doing it in a public and confrontational manner could be seen as tactless. The author's action might be justified in intent but flawed in execution. However, since the wife is the one being cheated on, the author's action, even if harsh, is exposing the truth. But was it the right time and place?\n\nAlso, the author admitted they did it out of anger during an argument. That might imply that the disclosure wasn't a thoughtful, compassionate act but a reaction to being insulted. That could make the act seem more like a personal attack rather than a concerned intervention.\n\nBut does the fact that the author knew about the cheating for a long time and chose not to say anything before affect the current situation? Maybe. If the friend had been cheating on previous partners and the author never told them, but now did it in a fit of anger, does that make the action more about revenge than concern?\n\nThe wife is the one being cheated on, so the author's action could be seen as helping her, even if it's done poorly. But if the author is just venting their own anger and not genuinely trying to help the wife, then it's a different story.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent, consequences, and context. If the author's main goal was to expose the cheating, even if done in a bad way, they might not be the asshole. But if it was done out of spite during an argument, then maybe they are.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a friend who knew about the cheating but didn't act until now. The fact that the wife was present might have been a spur-of-the-moment decision. The author might not be in the wrong because the core issue is the cheating, which is wrong. The method is questionable, but the intent might be seen as right. However, the way it was done could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the act itself (telling the wife about the cheating) is justified regardless of the method. In many moral frameworks, exposing infidelity is considered right, even if the delivery was poor. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the method was wrong, making them an asshole. But in AITA terms, maybe the author isn't the asshole because they're doing the right thing, even if poorly. So the answer is B.\n"
