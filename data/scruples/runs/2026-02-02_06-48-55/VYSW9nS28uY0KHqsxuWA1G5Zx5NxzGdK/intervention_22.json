Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of his wife. The situation is that they've known each other since middle school, the friend has a history of cheating, and the author found out about the latest infidelity with the secretary. The author kept quiet before but during an argument, they blurted it out in anger while the wife was present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the method and context in which the truth was revealed. Even if the author had a valid reason (the friend cheating), doing it in the middle of an argument where the friend's wife is present could be problematic. The author says it was out of anger, so maybe they were seeking revenge or trying to hurt the friend during the argument. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term friendships, how you handle sensitive information matters. The author might have thought they were being honest, but doing it in a confrontational setting without prior discussion could damage the friendship and cause unnecessary harm. The wife might have heard it, leading to a very awkward and painful situation for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was a serial cheater and was bragging about it, so maybe the author felt it was time to stop enabling the behavior. But the timing and the fact that it was done in anger without considering the consequences might make it an asshole move. \n\nThe user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm. I should weigh both sides: the act of revealing the truth, which is right, versus the manner in which it was done, which is questionable. The context does matter here because it was a heated argument and done impulsively. The author's intention was to retaliate, not to help, which is a key factor. \n\nSo, even though the content of the message is true, the way it was delivered in a moment of anger during an argument in front of the wife is likely the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
