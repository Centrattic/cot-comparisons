Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling out his friend for cheating in front of his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known his buddy since middle school and knows he's been a serial cheater. The buddy has been cheating with his secretary, and the author knew about it because the friend bragged. The author didn't tell the wife before, thinking it wasn't their problem. Then, during an argument at a brewery, the author, out of anger, blurts out \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while the wife is there.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had prior knowledge of the cheating, chose not to tell the wife before, and then during an argument, revealed the cheating in a confrontational way. The question is whether this action makes the author the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Telling someone they're being cheated on is generally seen as a good deed, but the context matters. The author didn't approach the wife privately; instead, he did it in a public setting during an argument. This was a reaction to a fight, so it's not a calm, considerate revelation. The author's motivation might be to do the right thing, but the method was confrontational and public, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was cheating repeatedly, and the author had the information. Not telling the wife could be seen as complicit. But how it's told is important. Doing it in the heat of an argument in front of others is not a respectful way to handle it. The author might have good intentions but executed it poorly.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at intent vs. impact. The intent was to inform the wife, which is good, but the impact was damaging and done in a bad way. The author might be considered in the wrong because they didn't approach the wife directly and respectfully first. Instead, they used it as a weapon during an argument, which is unkind and could have lasting consequences.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because of the method and timing of the disclosure, even if the content was truthful.\n"
