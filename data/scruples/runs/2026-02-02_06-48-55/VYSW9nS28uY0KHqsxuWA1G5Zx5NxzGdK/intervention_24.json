Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by confronting his friend about cheating in front of his wife. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend has a history of cheating, and the author knew about it for a while but didn't say anything before. The argument happened at a brewery, and the author said it out of anger. The key points here are the timing, the public setting, and the method of confrontation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the context changes the outcome. Normally, telling someone their partner is cheating is a sensitive issue. But doing it in a public place during an argument adds layers. The author's friend might have been caught off guard, and the wife being present could make it more hurtful and public. Also, the author's motivation was anger rather than concern, which might not be the best reason to bring up something so personal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend has a pattern of cheating, so maybe the author felt it was necessary. But even so, the way it was done\u2014publicly during an argument\u2014could be seen as harsh. The author didn't approach his friend privately first, which is usually the advised method. \n\nSo considering all that, the author probably acted in the heat of the moment without thinking about the consequences. Even though the truth is important, the manner and timing of the revelation might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
