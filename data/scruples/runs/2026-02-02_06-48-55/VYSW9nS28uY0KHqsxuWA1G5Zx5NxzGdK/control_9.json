Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for cheating in front of his wife is wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known the friend since middle school. The friend has been cheating before, especially with the secretary, and the author knew about it but didn't say anything before. This time, during an argument at a brewery, the author says it in front of the wife. The question is whether this is an asshole move, considering the context.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author withheld information for a long time, then released it in the heat of an argument. The friend's wife was present. The author argues that the context (the argument) might change the usual judgment. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, people often debate these scenarios. Typically, if someone reveals a cheating scandal in a public setting and during a conflict, it's seen as a betrayal, even if the information is true. The method of disclosure matters. Even if the friend was a cheater before, the way the author chose to confront him\u2014publicly and in anger\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe wife's presence adds another layer. The author didn't go to the wife directly but did it during an argument. The usual advice is to handle such revelations privately and with care. Public shaming, even if the person is guilty, can be considered rude. The fact that the author had the information for a year and didn't act on it until an argument might suggest they were using it as a weapon, which is not a good motive.\n\nSo the context here is that the author acted out of anger during an argument. Even if the truth came out, the manner and timing were inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong). The person who cheated is the wrongdoer, but the author's approach was inappropriate. Hence, AITA would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
