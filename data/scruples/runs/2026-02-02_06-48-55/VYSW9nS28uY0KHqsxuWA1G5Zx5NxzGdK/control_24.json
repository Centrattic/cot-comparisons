Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong for calling out their friend for cheating in front of the friend's wife. The situation involves a long-time friend who's been a serial cheater, and the author has known about it for a while but didn't say anything before. The argument escalated, and in anger, the author revealed the cheating in front of the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had known about the cheating for a year and chose not to tell the wife before. That's a key point. The user is asking if the context changes whether it's an asshole move. The author's motivation here was anger during an argument, which might affect the judgment.\n\nOn one hand, exposing someone's infidelity is usually a sensitive issue. Doing it in front of their spouse without prior discussion could cause immediate harm, even if the intent was to stop the cheating. The wife now has to process this information in a public setting, possibly without support. That's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were protecting their friend's wife by revealing the truth. The problem is that the method was inconsiderate and done in the heat of the moment, which could be seen as thoughtless. The author didn't approach it privately, which is typically the more responsible way to handle such a situation.\n\nAlso, the author's history of not confronting the friend about previous cheatings suggests a pattern of inaction. Now, after an argument, the sudden decision to speak up might look more like retaliation or a loss of temper rather than a measured action. This could be seen as hypocritical or as using the wife as a pawn in their argument.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the truth is important, the manner and timing matter. The author's action might be well-intentioned but poorly executed. The wife's right to know is important, but the way the information is delivered can significantly impact the outcome. Public confrontation during an argument isn't the best approach for such a sensitive issue.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action is problematic. They might not be entirely at fault because the underlying issue (cheating) is wrong, but the way they handled it crosses into asshole territory. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
