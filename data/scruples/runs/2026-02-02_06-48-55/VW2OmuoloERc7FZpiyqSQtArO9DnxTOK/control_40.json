Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child after their first son has autism. The situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the author has a son with autism and several other medical issues. He's concerned about bringing another child into the world who might face similar challenges. The author loves his son but feels it's selfish to have another child if they might have a hard life. His wife thinks he's being selfish, but he thinks he's being responsible.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, parents have the right to make decisions about their family size. The author is worried about the quality of life for a potential sibling and the family's ability to handle another child's needs. That seems like a valid concern. Also, he's honest about his feelings and isn't hiding his reservations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not wanting to have another child because of autism could be seen as a negative view of autistic lives. But the author clearly states he loves his son deeply. He's not rejecting his son but is concerned about another child's potential experiences. There's a difference between making a personal choice based on circumstances and holding a discriminatory view.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She might feel the decision is unfair or based on fear. However, the author's reasoning is rooted in his current challenges. It's a tough balance between personal capacity and ethical considerations.\n\nIn the end, the decision is a personal one. The author isn't forcing anyone else; it's about their family's future. While there are valid arguments against his stance, the right to make such a choice isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
