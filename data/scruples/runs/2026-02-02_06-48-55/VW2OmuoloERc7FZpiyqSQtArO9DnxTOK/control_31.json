Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's selfish to not want another child because the first has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a son with autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. The author and wife had wanted a second child, but after the autism diagnosis, the author changed their mind. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world if they might have similar difficulties. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and mean.\n\nSo the key points are: the author's reasoning is based on not wanting another child to suffer, but the wife thinks that's selfish. The author is conflicted because they love their son but are worried about the quality of life for another child.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on the potential suffering of a future child. They might believe it's morally wrong to bring a child into a life with similar hardships. On the other hand, some might argue that the author is assuming the future child's quality of life and making a judgment that's not their place. Also, autism is a part of a person's identity and doesn't inherently mean suffering; many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's decision might be based on their current experiences but may not account for future possibilities or the child's own perspective.\n\nThe author is also projecting based on their current son's issues. The second child might not have autism or the same physical issues. Decisions about having children are personal, but making such a decision based on potential genetic factors could be seen as a personal choice. However, the author is using the existing child's condition as a reason to not have another, which the wife finds selfish. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be influenced by their own child's negative experiences (like bullying), but that's a societal issue rather than the child's inherent value. The author's reasoning could be seen as a way to avoid future stress on the family, but it might also be avoiding responsibility or underestimating the capabilities of autistic individuals.\n\nIn terms of whether it's right or wrong, societal views vary. Some might say the author is protecting future children from hardship, others might say it's a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is not worth living. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid or selfish. \n\nThe answer likely depends on ethical perspectives. If the author is making a decision based on their understanding of potential suffering, some might agree it's a personal choice (not in the wrong). Others might see it as wrong to deny another person the chance to live, regardless of their condition. The text doesn't provide enough info on the wife's perspective, but the author is justified in their feelings, even if others disagree. \n\nSo, the answer would be whether the author is in the wrong. Since the question is asking for A or B, and considering that personal decisions about family planning are complex and the author's reasoning isn't inherently malicious (they care about their son), it's a nuanced case. However, many might argue that the author is not in the wrong, as it's their choice based on their circumstances. Alternatively, others might argue that the author is being selfish by not considering that autism doesn't equate to suffering. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), as the decision is based on their personal experiences and concerns for future children's well-being, even if others disagree.\n"
