Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism. They mention he has other issues like eczema, allergies, and sleep problems. The author is saying that he doesn't want another child because they might end up with similar or worse challenges. His wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels it's not selfish to avoid bringing another child into such a hard life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on his current experiences and the potential hardship for another child. On the other hand, people might argue that it's not his place to decide another child's life quality or that autism isn't a curse but a part of neurodiversity. Also, the author might be making assumptions about future children's lives based on his son's condition, which isn't necessarily hereditary or guaranteed.\n\nAutism isn't always a disability; it's a spectrum. Some autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives. The author might be projecting his son's specific challenges onto any future child, which could be an overgeneralization. Also, the decision to have children is personal, and the author is acting on his values and the current stress levels in his family.\n\nHowever, others might say that choosing not to have more children based on the potential for autism is a form of ableism, implying that lives with autism are less valuable. It's also possible that the author's decision is influenced by the stress of managing their son's needs, which is a valid concern for family planning.\n\nI need to balance these viewpoints. The author isn't discriminating against his son but is considering the future. However, he might be making assumptions about another child's life quality. The answer isn't black and white, but typically, such decisions are seen as personal. However, some might argue that the author is wrong for not wanting another child, assuming that autism isn't a burden. Others would support his right to make that choice.\n\nIn similar \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, people are often told it's their choice unless they're harming others. The author isn't harming his wife or son by choosing not to have another child. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, if there's a societal expectation that children with autism have lower quality of life, that could influence the answer. But current perspectives emphasize neurodiversity and the value of all lives, which might suggest the author is in the wrong for assuming another child's life would be worse. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the consensus would be that it's his choice, so answer B.\n"
