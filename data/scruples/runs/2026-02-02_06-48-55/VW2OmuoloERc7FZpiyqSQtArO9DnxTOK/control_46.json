Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they have an autistic son with various challenges and they don't want a second child because they don't want another child to have a hard life. Their wife is upset, thinking they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for future children. On one hand, deciding not to have another child is a personal choice. On the other hand, autism is part of the human experience, and not having children could be seen as a way to avoid potential suffering, but others might argue that it's not fair to make that choice based on a condition that's part of the spectrum.\n\nAutism isn't a disease or a deficit; it's a neurodevelopmental difference. The author's reasoning might stem from the challenges they currently face, but they are projecting that any future child would have the same or worse difficulties. However, autism presents differently in each individual. Some autistic people have a high quality of life and contribute meaningfully to society. The author might be making assumptions about what an autistic life would be like for their future child, which could be influenced by their current struggles.\n\nThe author mentions their son's specific issues like sleep problems, eczema, allergies, and autism. They link these to the idea that another child might have similar or worse issues. But not all autistic children have those physical conditions. The author is conflating autism with other medical issues their son has, which might not be connected. It's possible that their son's other health problems are unrelated to autism.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important here. She thinks the author is being selfish. There's a cultural taboo around not wanting to have children, especially when it's based on the possibility of the child having a neurodivergent condition. However, the author is making a choice based on their capacity to care for a child with potential needs. They might be considering the emotional and physical toll of raising another child with similar challenges.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the author is making a decision based on their own experience, which is valid. They are not saying autism is bad, but they are concerned about the combination of factors their son has. However, by not wanting to have another child, they might be acting out of fear of future hardships rather than a rejection of autism itself. This could be seen as a personal choice, but others might argue that it's not ethical to make decisions about other people's potential lives.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not wrong for making a personal decision about their family's future. However, there's a debate about whether it's ethical to avoid having children based on the possibility of them having a condition that some view as part of human diversity. The answer depends on whether one sees autism as a disability to be avoided or as a natural variation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is making a choice based on their circumstances and feelings. They are not necessarily in the wrong for deciding not to have another child, even if others disagree. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
