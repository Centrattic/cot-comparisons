Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their son has autism and now doesn't want a second child because they don't want another child to suffer similarly. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's decision to not have another child is based on their son's autism and the associated challenges. They mention the son's physical issues like sleep disturbances, eczema, allergies, and the stress that comes with caring for him. The author's reasoning is that bringing another child into the world with a high probability of similar or worse struggles is selfish. The wife, however, disagrees, calling the author selfish and an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break this down. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while the son is diagnosed, it's important to note that having one autistic child doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be as well. The author is making an assumption that their next child could have autism and similar or worse conditions. That might not be accurate, as autism can have various causes and isn't always genetically deterministic. \n\nThe author's concern is about the child's quality of life and not wanting to impose similar hardships. However, this reasoning could be seen as problematically assuming that a life with autism is inherently \"bad\" or not worth living. The decision is based on the potential for another child to have the same issues, but that might not be a fair or inclusive view. People with autism often lead fulfilling lives, and the author's perspective could be considered ableist, implying that their son's life is less valuable because of his conditions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also considering the family's capacity to handle another child with similar challenges. Raising a child with autism can be demanding, and adding another child with similar needs might overwhelm them. However, not having a second child because of the possibility of another child having autism could be seen as a prejudiced decision against people with autism. The author is making a choice based on their son's specific issues, but it's possible they are conflating autism with the physical and behavioral challenges their son currently faces. \n\nThe wife's reaction is that the author is being selfish and spiteful. The author might be projecting their own feelings onto the idea of another child. The phrase \"bringing a child into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's\" suggests that the author believes their son's life isn't worth having. That's a problematic stance because it's a value judgment about the worth of a life based on disability. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's current son having eczema, allergies, and sleep issues, which are separate from autism. The author is grouping all these challenges together, possibly implying that autism is the root cause. This could be an oversimplification. Additionally, the author is using the experiences of their son to generalize about a hypothetical future child. \n\nThe key ethical question here is whether it's wrong to decide against having another child based on the potential for a disability that the current child has. This is a complex area. On one hand, every family has the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. On the other hand, making such a decision based on the assumption that a child with autism has a \"hard\" life could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nIn some cases, people choose not to have children for various reasons, including health, financial, or personal circumstances. However, the assumption that a life with autism is inherently worse might not be shared by the autistic community. Many autistic individuals and their families value their lives and find meaning despite challenges. The author's perspective might not account for the variability of autism and the support systems that can help a child thrive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reasoning could be seen as flawed because they are making a value judgment about the quality of life for someone with autism. Even if the author's intention is to protect a potential future child, the underlying assumption that autism is a curse or a burden might be the problem. The wife's concern about the author being spiteful could stem from this perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expressing such a view, which could be perceived as ableist.\n"
