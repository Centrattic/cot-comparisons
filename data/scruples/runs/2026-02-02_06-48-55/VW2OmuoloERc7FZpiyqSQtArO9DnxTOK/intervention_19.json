Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a young son who, after being evaluated, is diagnosed with autism. The son has various challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and being autistic. The author feels that bringing another child into the world might lead to similar or worse struggles. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish. The author is conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. I need to weigh the arguments. On one side, the author is making a decision based on his family's experience, prioritizing not wanting another child to face hardships. On the other, some might argue that autism is just one part of a person's identity and that the decision is based on a fear of future challenges, which could be seen as prejudicial or discriminatory.\n\nBut then again, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. However, the author does mention that he loves his son unconditionally, so it's not about rejecting autism itself. The concern is about potential hardships. But is it fair to assume the next child would have similar issues? Autism can present differently, and not all autistic children face the same level of challenges. Also, the author is making a choice based on his son's specific conditions, not autism as a whole.\n\nAnother point is the author's wife's perspective. She thinks he's being selfish. Maybe she sees the decision as not considering the possibility of supporting another child, or maybe she values having more children regardless of the challenges. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to risk another child's well-being, but is that a valid reason? Or is it overreaching to decide another child's quality of life?\n\nEthically, it's a complex issue. On the one hand, parents have the right to make decisions about their family size. On the other, some might argue that not wanting to have a child with disabilities isn't inherently wrong, but others might see it as a failure to support or accept all forms of life. However, the author isn't refusing care or support for his current child; he's making a choice about future children based on his assessment of potential suffering.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, the AITA subreddit often focuses on social norms. In many societies, there's a stigma against not wanting to have a child with disabilities, but others support reproductive autonomy. The author's reasoning might be seen as selfish by some, but others might empathize with his concerns about the family's capacity to cope.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's decision is based on a reasonable assessment of his family's situation. He's considering the physical, emotional, and possibly financial strain of raising another child with similar challenges. While it's true that not all autistic children have the same issues, the author is making a personal choice to avoid a potentially overwhelming situation. However, by framing autism as inherently negative (\"badly afflicted\"), he might be contributing to a negative view of autism. But his intention is to protect a future child from hardship, not to devalue his current son's worth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the decision is personal and valid, there's a chance the author is underestimating the support systems available or overestimating the likelihood of similar issues in another child. However, he's not in the wrong for making a choice based on his family's specific circumstances and his values. So the answer would be B, he is not in the wrong.\n"
