Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have another child due to their son's autism. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, physical conditions like eczema and allergies, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The author feels it's not right to bring another child into such a situation, fearing the next child might have similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author believes they're acting responsibly by not risking another child's well-being.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. Autonomy is a big factor here. Parents have the right to make decisions based on their circumstances. The author isn't making a decision out of hatred or prejudice against autistic individuals. They're making a personal choice based on their experience of the challenges their current child faces. They express love for their son but are considering the potential hardships another child might face.\n\nHowever, autism itself isn't a curse; people with autism can lead fulfilling lives. The author's decision is based on fear of potential hardships, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. It's their choice how many children to have. On the other hand, the wife might feel the author is being unfair, but unless there's a clear ethical violation, like discrimination, it's a personal decision.\n\nAnother angle: should one child's needs dictate the decision about another? The author is prioritizing the potential well-being of a future child, which is a valid consideration. However, it's also possible that they're overestimating the hardships, but that's not necessarily their fault given their current experience.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often have strong opinions on this. Some might argue it's selfish to not want another child, while others would support the decision to avoid potential suffering. The key here is that the author isn't making a judgment against autistic people but is making a choice for their family's specific situation.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice based on their family's circumstances and their assessment of what's best for future children. There's no legal or ethical obligation to have more children, and personal well-being and family dynamics are significant factors.\n"
