Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's take a look at this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deciding against having a second child due to their son's autism diagnosis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the author's reasoning. They found out their son is autistic and have several challenges managing his care. They mention sleep deprivation, health issues, and concerns about potential bullying. The author's main argument is that bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish, given the hardships they're already facing. The wife, however, disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about future children possibly having similar or worse struggles. On one hand, this could be seen as a protective stance, wanting to avoid unnecessary suffering. On the other, some might argue that it's discriminatory to assume a child with autism can't have a good life, or that the parents can't manage another child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support. The author's decision is based on their son's specific issues, but they might be conflating autism as a whole with their son's experiences. Also, the decision to have another child is a personal one, and the author isn't forcing anything on their current son; they're just making a choice for their future.\n\nHowever, the concern here is about the mindset of considering autism as a curse or a negative aspect that should be avoided. The author's reasoning could be seen as ableist, implying that a life with autism is inherently less valuable. But the author is also expressing their personal limits and the reality of their current situation. It's possible they're overwhelmed and making a decision they believe protects future children from hardship.\n\nThe wife's reaction adds another layer. If the author's decision is based on a realistic assessment of their current stress and resources, it's understandable. But if they're making assumptions about another child's life quality, that's where the line might be crossed. The key is whether the author is making a judgment about the worth of a potential autistic child's life, which could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid and their decision is personal, there's a risk of perpetuating negative stereotypes about autism. However, since they're making a choice for themselves without imposing on others, it's a complex situation. The answer might hinge on whether the decision is seen as selfish or a responsible choice based on current circumstances.\n"
