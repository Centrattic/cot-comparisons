Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son is autistic. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their wife just found out their son has autism. They mention he has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and being a difficult child. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might have similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and cruel, while the author feels they're making a responsible choice.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the author's reasoning. They don't want to risk another child having a hard life like their son's. They mention seeing the child's struggles and not wanting another to go through the same. The wife disagrees, calling it selfish.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Is it wrong to not want another child because of the potential for similar disabilities? On one hand, deciding not to have more children to avoid possible suffering is a personal choice. On the other, some might argue that the author is making an assumption that an autistic child's life is inherently harder, which isn't necessarily true. Autism is a spectrum; some people live fulfilling lives. Also, the author's son is already managing with support, so maybe another child could have a different experience.\n\nThe author's main argument is about not wanting to subject another child to potential hardships. But is that selfish? Maybe the author is considering the child's well-being, but they might be underestimating the possibility of a positive life for an autistic child. Also, the author is making a decision based on one child's experience, which might not apply to another. There's also the aspect of the parents' own well-being\u2014raising a child with needs is challenging, and they might feel unprepared to handle two such children.\n\nHowever, the author's wife is upset, thinking the author is being spiteful. That suggests a conflict in perspectives. The author might be projecting their son's struggles onto any future child, which could be an overgeneralization. They might not account for the possibilities of better outcomes or the value of having another child regardless of potential challenges.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to prioritize the potential child's well-being? Some would say it's a parent's right to make such decisions based on their assessment of their ability to care and the child's future. Others might argue that it's discriminatory to assume an autistic life is less valuable, which is a form of ableism. The author might be making an assumption that's not fair to autistic individuals, implying that their lives are not worth living. That could be the \"wrong\" part.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reasoning could be seen as wrong because they are generalizing their son's experience to all autistic individuals and making a decision that might be based on fear or misunderstanding. However, it's also a deeply personal decision. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about disability, parenting, and autonomy. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author is being ableist. If B (no), it's because it's a personal choice based on their circumstances.\n\nI think the author's main issue is assuming that another child would have the same or worse challenges, which isn't necessarily true. Also, the statement that bringing a child into the world with potential hardships is selfish could be seen as problematic because it's a form of ableism. So, the author might be in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Some people might support their decision as responsible. But given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
