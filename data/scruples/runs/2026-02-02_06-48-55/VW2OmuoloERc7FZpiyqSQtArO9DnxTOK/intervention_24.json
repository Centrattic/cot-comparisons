Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is a parent who found out their son has autism and decided against having a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences. They have a valid concern about the potential for another child to have similar challenges. However, is it selfish to not have another child? People have many reasons for choosing not to have children, and this is a deeply personal choice. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect future children from hardship. They mention the existing child's difficulties: sleep issues, health problems, autism. They worry about the child's quality of life and the possibility of future children facing similar issues. That seems like a selfless motivation because they don't want to subject another child to suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using their current child's condition as a reason to not have another child, which might imply a belief that having a child with autism is inherently worse. But autism is a spectrum, and many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might be influenced by their specific child's challenges rather than autism as a whole. Also, the decision could be seen as avoiding responsibility or not supporting the possibility of a positive experience with another child who might not have autism.\n\nAnother angle: the author's wife feels they're being spiteful. Maybe the author is projecting their fears onto a potential future child, which could be unfair. The author might not be considering that their current child's experience is unique and that another child could have different needs or abilities. Also, deciding based on the potential for hardship might be a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is not worth living or is inherently suffering.\n\nBut the author's primary concern is the well-being of their future children. They're making a choice based on their capacity to provide care. If they feel they can't manage another child with similar needs, it's reasonable to opt out. However, this could also be seen as a lack of commitment to family expansion regardless of circumstances.\n\nI think the key here is whether not wanting another child because of the possibility of the child having a condition that's present in the first child is considered selfish. If the author is making a decision based on their ability to cope and provide care, it's understandable. But if they're devaluing the lives of autistic individuals by implying that such lives are too difficult, that's problematic. The author needs to be careful not to generalize their son's experience to all autistic people.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a personal decision based on their current circumstances and feelings. However, they might need to reflect on whether their decision is influenced by ableist attitudes. The answer isn't black and white, but the decision itself isn't inherently selfish if it's about their capacity to care, not a judgment on the worth of autistic lives.\n"
