Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. The author lists several challenges with their son's condition, including autism, sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, even though their wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Autistic individuals can lead fulfilling lives, and autism is a part of neurodiversity. The author might be making assumptions about the quality of life for an autistic child based on their son's struggles. However, they are also considering the child's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author mentions the risks of potential suffering, but it's important to note that not all autistic children face the same challenges. Each case is unique. The decision to have children is deeply personal and involves weighing various factors. The author isn't making a decision to harm but to avoid possible future hardships. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's not their place to decide someone else's quality of life. The author's intention is to prevent suffering, but others might view this as a form of ableism. The wife's perspective is also important; she might see the decision as dismissive of the value of life with autism. \n\nThe key points are the author's genuine concern for the child's well-being versus the potential for ableist thinking. It's a complex issue without clear right or wrong. The answer depends on whether prioritizing future potential hardships over the possibility of a happy, fulfilling life is considered selfish or a responsible decision.\n"
