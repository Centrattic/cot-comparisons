Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a son with autism who also has other issues like sleeping problems, eczema, allergies, and seems to be a challenging child. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar issues, is selfish. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is being selfish and an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. The author is expressing concern for the potential suffering of another child and their own ability to care for another child given their current situation. They might feel that having another child with similar challenges would be too much, both for the child and the family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory or eugenicist thinking to avoid having another child based on the possibility of disability. They might say that people with autism can lead fulfilling lives, and the decision is based on the author's own challenges rather than the child's inherent worth. Also, the author might be overgeneralizing, assuming the next child would have the same or worse issues, which isn't certain.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is rooted in their current experiences. They mention sleep deprivation, health issues, and the difficulties their son faces. It's understandable they want to avoid repeating that. However, deciding against a second child based on the possibility of autism might be influenced by ableist attitudes, even if unintended. \n\nIt's also important to note that autism is a spectrum, and many autistic individuals have successful lives. The author's perspective might be shaped by their son's specific challenges rather than autism itself. Additionally, the decision to have children is deeply personal, and the author isn't making a choice that directly harms others. They are choosing their family size based on their current situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's complex. While the author's intentions are to prevent potential suffering, their reasoning might overlook the value and potential of individuals with autism. However, they are not making a choice that affects others negatively except perhaps their wife's wishes. The wife's reaction is also a factor here, as she perceives the author's stance as selfish, which might indicate a conflict in their values.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because reproductive decisions are personal. However, there's a valid argument that the reasoning could be influenced by ableism. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering their stated reasons and the context, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
