Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent whose son has autism and they don't want to have a second child due to the potential challenges. His wife is upset with him, calling him selfish, but he feels he's making a responsible choice.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author is dealing with a child who has multiple challenges: autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies. These are significant stressors. The decision not to have another child is based on concerns about the child's well-being and not wanting to bring another child into a difficult situation.\n\nBut is this decision selfish? The author argues that they don't want another child to suffer similarly. However, others might see this as making assumptions about the future child's life. Autism is a spectrum; some individuals live happy, fulfilling lives. Also, the decision to have children is personal and complex. The author's spouse is upset, which adds a relationship dynamic.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong in personal choice regarding family planning. But socially, there might be judgment. The key points are whether the author is acting out of self-interest or genuine concern for a potential child. The author mentions not wanting to \"roll the dice\" on another child's health, which could be seen as overcautious or as responsible planning.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning might stem from their current challenges but doesn't account for future possibilities, like better support systems or therapies. Also, the author's spouse's perspective is valid; she might feel the decision is based on fear rather than reality.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole (AITA), the question is whether the author is being unreasonable. The author's stance is based on their experience, but dismissing the possibility of a better future for another child could be seen as limiting that child's potential. The spouse's argument is that the author is being selfish by not considering other possibilities.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the decision is based on fear or realistic assessment. The author isn't in the wrong for having different views, but the spouse's feelings are also valid. The author's reasoning could be seen as protective but might overlook potential positive outcomes. However, since the question is about being an asshole, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced issue. The decision to have children is personal, and the author isn't causing direct harm. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
