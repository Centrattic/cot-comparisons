Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their existing son has autism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple found out their son has autism, which is confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges\u2014sleep issues, physical conditions like eczema and allergies, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The father feels that bringing another child into the world might result in another child with similar or worse difficulties and doesn't want that. The wife disagrees, calling him selfish and spiteful.\n\nThe key points here are the father's reasoning and the moral implications. The father's stance is that it's selfish to subject another child to what he perceives as a difficult life. He loves his son but is concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. The wife argues he's being an asshole, suggesting that his reasoning is flawed or unethical.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider ethical perspectives. One angle is the value of life. The father is essentially saying that if a child's life is going to be hard (due to autism and other conditions), it's better not to bring that child into the world. This touches on the non-identity problem in ethics\u2014future individuals can't consent, so is it ethical to decide against their existence because of potential suffering? Some argue that it's not our place to determine who is worthy of life, while others might see it as a responsible choice based on the parents' circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that all autistic children have the same level of hardship. The father generalizes his son's experience, but autism is a spectrum. Many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives, and the challenges vary. The father might be underestimating the potential quality of life for another child, even if they have autism. Additionally, his view might be influenced by the specific challenges their current son has, which might not apply to another child.\n\nThe father also mentions bullying from his school days, implying that autistic individuals are often bullied. While this is a valid concern, it's important to note that societal attitudes are changing, and support systems are improving. However, the father's decision is based on his perception of the current environment, which is subjective.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she believes the father is being discriminatory. The father's reasoning could be seen as devaluing the lives of people with autism, which is a form of ableism. By choosing not to have another child based on the possibility of them being autistic, he's making a value judgment about the worth of those lives. This is a contentious issue, as some people with autism advocate for their right to exist and reject the notion that their lives are less valuable.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is making a personal decision based on his family's well-being. Raising a child with significant needs is extremely challenging and can affect the entire family's quality of life. The father might feel that having another child would stretch their resources too thin, especially given their current situation. This is a practical consideration, and it's not inherently wrong to take one's capacity into account when deciding to have more children.\n\nHowever, the ethical dilemma is whether it's right to base the decision on the child's potential characteristics. If the couple is open to providing support and accommodations for a second child, even if they have autism, that might be a more compassionate approach. The father's stance might be seen as avoiding the responsibility to provide care and support, instead opting out by not having another child.\n\nIn summary, the father's position is complex. He's expressing a desire to avoid potential hardship for future children, but this can be viewed as making a value judgment on the lives of those with autism. The wife's perspective is that this is selfish, which might stem from the belief that all lives have inherent value and that the family can adapt and support another child. The answer hinges on whether prioritizing one's comfort and perceived quality of life for future children overrides the ethical considerations of not bringing them into existence.\n\nI think there's merit in both perspectives. However, from an ethical standpoint, many would argue that it's not the parents' place to decide the worth of a potential life based on potential challenges. Therefore, the father might be in the wrong for making that judgment, even if his intentions are to protect future children from hardship.\n"
