Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple found out their young son has autism, confirmed by a specialist. The author is not surprised and has noticed signs. The son has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, medical conditions like eczema and allergies, and the father is worried that a second child might inherit similar or worse issues. He doesn't want to bring another child into such a hard life, thinking it's selfish. His wife disagrees, calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding against a second child based on their son's autism. \n\nI should consider different angles. On one hand, the author is prioritizing the well-being of a potential future child, which is a valid concern. Parents do make decisions based on the child's quality of life. On the other hand, autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, not a disease. People with autism can lead fulfilling lives. The author's reasoning might be based on stereotypes or misunderstanding about autism, especially if he's equating it with suffering. Also, the decision might be influenced by the current stress of raising an autistic child, but that doesn't automatically make it wrong.\n\nThe author's main point is about not wanting another child to face a \"hard life.\" But autism doesn't define someone's life quality entirely. The author is making assumptions about what a future child's life would be like. Also, the wife's feelings are part of the conflict here; she might feel rejected, as the author's decision could affect their family plans.\n\nAnother angle: reproductive decisions are personal. The author isn't forced to have another child, so it's his choice. However, the wife's input is important. The conflict here is between the couple's differing viewpoints. The author's stance might be seen as discriminatory if it's based on ableism\u2014believing that a life with autism is inherently worse. That's a key point. If the author is making a decision based on the belief that autism makes life less valuable, that's problematic.\n\nIn the AITA context, some might argue the author is being selfish by prioritizing his own fears over his wife's wishes. Others might see it as a responsible choice to avoid potential hardship. But if the author is making assumptions about the future child's life based on his son's experiences, which could be different, that's another layer.\n\nI need to check if there's a consensus on this. In general, deciding not to have another child due to genetic concerns isn't unheard of. However, the way the author frames autism as a burden might be the issue. The author's statement about not wanting to bring a child into a hard life could be seen as a failure to accept disability as part of human diversity. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's son having other issues like eczema and allergies, which the author might be conflating with autism. The author might be generalizing the son's hardships to autism itself, which is a separate condition. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the reasoning. If he's making a decision based on ableist beliefs, then yes. If it's a personal choice based on family circumstances, maybe not. But the way he phrases it, focusing on the potential suffering of a future child, might be problematic. So, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because his reasoning perpetuates the idea that certain lives are less valuable, which is a form of ableism. His wife's perspective is that he's being selfish, which could be valid if he's dismissing her desire for another child without fully considering their ability to support a future child, regardless of their condition.\n"
