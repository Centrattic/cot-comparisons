Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The author is deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism, and they're worried the next child might also have similar challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The author's son has autism, along with other issues like sleep problems, eczema, allergies. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is being selfish and spiteful. The author is conflicted but doesn't want to take the risk.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on their current experiences and future concerns. On the other hand, making such a significant life choice based on the possibility of another child having similar challenges could be seen as discriminatory or prejudiced against people with autism. Also, the author might be underestimating the potential of a future child to have a different experience or for the family to adapt.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and each individual's experience varies. The author is not certain the next child would have the same issues. They're making a decision based on their current child's struggles, which might not be the same for another child. However, the decision to have children is personal, and people have the right to make choices based on their circumstances and values.\n\nBut is it considered wrong? Some might argue that it's selfish to avoid having another child due to potential challenges, while others might support the decision as responsible given the existing hardships. The author's concern is about the child's well-being and the family's ability to cope. The wife's reaction suggests they have differing views on responsibility and family planning.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The author is not discriminating against their current son but is concerned about potential future challenges. However, the post could imply a negative view of autistic lives, believing they are less worth living, which could be seen as problematic. The author's statement about bullying and the child's quality of life might reflect societal biases that undervalue people with disabilities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have children is complex. While it's valid for someone to choose not to have another child for personal reasons, making that decision based on the possibility of disability might reflect a problematic attitude. The author might be projecting their current struggles onto a future child without considering that the next child could have a different experience or that the family could find support and resources to manage it.\n\nSo, considering all this, there's a case that the author is in the wrong because their reasoning could be seen as devaluing the lives of autistic individuals. However, others might argue it's a personal choice. The answer might depend on how the community perceives the decision. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, aligning with the idea that it's unethical to avoid parenthood based on disability concerns.\n"
