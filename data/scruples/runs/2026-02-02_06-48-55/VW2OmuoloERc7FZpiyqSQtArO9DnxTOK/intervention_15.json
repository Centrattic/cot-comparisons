Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child after finding out their first son is autistic. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son has autism, and he's facing challenges like sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. The author now doesn't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the potential quality of life for another child. The key points here are autonomy in family planning and perceptions of selfishness.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reasoning is that they don't want to bring a child into a difficult situation. They might believe they're acting in the child's best interest. On the other hand, others might argue that it's presumptuous to assume a future child's life would be as hard, and that they're making a judgment based on their current child's specific challenges. Also, autism is a spectrum, and experiences vary widely. \n\nThe author's wife's reaction suggests a conflict in their values. The author is prioritizing avoiding potential hardship, while the wife sees it as selfish. But whether it's \"wrong\" depends on one's perspective on reproductive choices and disability. There's no right or wrong answer here; it's a matter of differing values. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to make personal decisions about their family based on their circumstances and beliefs. However, there's a valid argument that they might be making assumptions about future children's lives. But ultimately, it's their choice, and labeling them as an asshole for that is subjective. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
