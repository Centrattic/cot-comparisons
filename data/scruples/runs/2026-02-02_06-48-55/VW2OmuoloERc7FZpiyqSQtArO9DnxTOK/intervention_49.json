Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son is autistic. The author argues that bringing another child into a situation where they might have autism and other challenges is selfish. The wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of making decisions based on potential future conditions. The author is making a choice based on the possibility that a future child might have similar issues. But autism is a spectrum, and each child is unique. His reasoning is rooted in a desire to avoid suffering, which is a parent's natural instinct. However, others might see this as making assumptions about the future child's life quality and dismissing the value of diversity and inclusion.\n\nNext, the author's perspective on autism. He seems to view it as a burden, given the challenges mentioned like sleep issues, health problems, and past bullying. But autism is a part of someone's identity, and many in the autism community advocate against viewing it as a disease or deficit. The author's decision might be influenced by a deficit-based view rather than a neurodiversity perspective.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. His wife is upset, which shows a conflict in their relationship. The decision to have children is a mutual one, and his unilateral stance might be causing her distress. It's important to consider both partners' feelings and whether he's being considerate of her wishes.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to not want another child due to concerns about potential disabilities? Some might argue that it's not selfish if the parent is prioritizing the child's well-being. Others might say it's a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse. It's also possible that the author is projecting his current struggles onto a future child without accounting for different circumstances or support systems.\n\nI should also think about the legal and moral implications. There's no law against this decision, but socially, there's a debate about the ethics of disability and reproduction. The author's reasoning might be seen as a personal choice, but it's in the context of a neurodiverse world where many people with autism live fulfilling lives.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is to protect a future child from hardship, his reasoning is based on assumptions rather than certainty. The decision could be considered selfish if it's based on a belief that a life with autism is not worth living, which is a viewpoint that can be seen as discriminatory. However, if it's based on genuine concerns about his capacity to provide care, it's a personal choice. The key is whether the decision is informed by respect for neurodiversity or fear-based assumptions. Given the author's statements, he might be in the wrong if he's contributing to a negative perception of autism.\n"
