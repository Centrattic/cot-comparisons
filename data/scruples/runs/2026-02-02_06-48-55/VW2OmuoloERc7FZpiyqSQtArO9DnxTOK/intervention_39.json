Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son is autistic. The answer options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is making a decision based on their son's challenges, which include autism, eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into a similar situation. Their wife disagrees, calling them selfish and spiteful.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their personal circumstances and what they believe is best for their family. The author is concerned about the potential for another child to face similar hardships, which is a valid concern given their current experience. They mention sleep deprivation and the stress of caring for a son with multiple needs, which are real factors in family planning.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that deciding against having another child based on autism could be seen as viewing autistic lives as less valuable or inherently difficult. Autism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might stem from a place of love and wanting to protect future children from hardship, but it could also be perceived as a negative attitude towards autism itself.\n\nI should also consider societal attitudes. There's a growing emphasis on acceptance and support for neurodiversity. Choosing not to have another child because of autism might be seen as stigmatizing. However, the decision is personal and based on the family's specific circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations, the potential stigma, and the right to make reproductive choices. The author isn't making a derogatory statement about autism but is reacting to their child's specific needs and their own capacity to care. They aren't against autism itself but are considering the practical and emotional toll based on their current situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may criticize the author's decision as being based on fear or misunderstanding of autism, their choice is ultimately a personal one. They are not in the wrong for prioritizing their family's well-being and acknowledging the challenges they've faced. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
