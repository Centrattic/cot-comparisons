Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son has autism. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife found out their son has autism, which was diagnosed early. They mention he has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, physical problems like eczema and allergies, and he's been difficult since birth. They loved him but now the author is against having another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks he's selfish, but he feels it's the right decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author is making a personal decision based on his family's experiences. Each family has to decide what's best for them. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential future child, considering the existing challenges they're already facing. But is his reasoning valid?\n\nOn one hand, he's not wrong for having his own feelings and concerns. It's a big decision, and parents should consider their capacity to care for more children. However, autism is a spectrum. Just because one child is autistic doesn't mean the next will be the same. Also, the author might be making assumptions about what having autism means for a child's life. Some people with autism lead fulfilling lives, and the author's perspective might be influenced by his own stressful experiences. He also mentions the bullying he observed in school, which might not reflect current societal attitudes or the child's actual experience.\n\nBut the author isn't saying he wants to avoid autism in the next child; he's concerned about the potential for similar hardships. However, his approach might come across as implying that a child with autism has a worse life, which could be seen as dismissive. The wife's reaction that he's being selfish could be because he's prioritizing his own fears over their previous desire for another child. Maybe he's projecting his current stress onto a future child without considering that they might have a different experience or that they could adapt better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings and the impact on their family. He loves his son but is considering the well-being of potential future children. It's a tough balance. The question is whether his reasoning is valid or if he's in the wrong for making that choice.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have the right to make decisions for their family. However, the way he's framing it\u2014suggesting that it's selfish not to have another child\u2014might not be the right approach. But the question isn't about how he expressed it, but whether he's in the wrong for holding that belief. \n\nI think there's a nuance here. The author is not wrong for having his concerns, but his reasoning might be flawed. He's assuming that another child would have the same issues, which isn't necessarily the case. Also, his view that it's better not to have a child with potential challenges might not consider the child's potential happiness or the family's ability to support them. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But if the question is whether he's in the wrong for his decision, the answer might depend on perspective. Some might say he's not wrong because it's a personal choice, while others might argue that it's unethical to make that decision based on assumptions. But since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to pick one. Considering that the author is making a personal choice based on his family's situation, even if his reasoning is flawed, he isn't inherently in the wrong. However, the way he's thinking might be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the reasoning's validity. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a strong argument for A because of the assumptions made. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B, but some might say A. I think the key is that the author isn't being malicious; he's making a decision based on his experiences and wants the best for future kids. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
