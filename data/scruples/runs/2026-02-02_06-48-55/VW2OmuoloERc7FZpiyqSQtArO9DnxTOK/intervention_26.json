Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism, though the specialist said it's clear even if it's usually diagnosed at 4. The author doesn't want a second child because they think the next child might also have autism and similar challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but the author sees it as not wanting to bring another child into a hard life.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasoning. They love their son but are concerned about the potential for another child to face the same or worse struggles. They mention their son's difficult behavior (screaming, thrashing, allergies, eczema) and the sleep deprivation. The key points here are the author's fear of replicating a hard life for another child and the wife's reaction.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about the ethics. Parents often make decisions based on their child's well-being and their ability to care. However, not wanting to have another child because of the possibility that it might share a similar condition (like autism) could be seen as problematic. Autism is a spectrum, and while the first child has it, the next child might not. Even if they did, having autism doesn't mean a life filled with suffering. The author is making a negative assumption about the potential quality of life for a future child, which might be considered prejudicial or ableist. They also mention the school kids they knew with autism being bullied, which is a societal issue, not inherent to autism itself. The author's focus is on the \"affliction\" of their son, which frames autism as a disease or something to avoid, which isn't accurate. Autism is a neurodivergent condition, not a disease. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is voicing their concerns based on their current experiences. They might feel overwhelmed and are trying to protect their family from future hardship. But do their reasons justify the conclusion that they are in the wrong? The mother and child with autism might have a different perspective. It's possible the author is underestimating the ability to adapt and provide a good life for another child, even if they have autism. The mother might feel that the author is dismissing their son's potential and the possibility that another child could have a different experience. \n\nIs it selfish to not want another child because of the first one's condition? That depends on the reasoning. If the author is prioritizing their own ability to cope over their son's well-being, that's one thing. But if they're assuming that another child would have a worse life, that's a judgment about the value of that potential life, which is ethically questionable. The author's statement about not wanting to \"roll those dice\" suggests they're making a decision based on perceived risks, which could be a personal choice, but if it's based on devaluing a life with autism, that's where the issue might be. \n\nSo, considering that autism is a natural variation and that the author's reasoning could be seen as devaluing lives with disabilities, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). However, the author's personal experience and stress are real. But the question is about right or wrong, not just whether their feelings are valid. Ethically, is it wrong to not want another child because of the possibility they might have a similar condition? It's a matter of perspective. Some might say it's a personal choice, but others might argue it's discriminatory. Given that the author is making a value judgment about the potential life of a future child based on autism, which is a stigmatized condition, the answer could be A. However, if the author is simply expressing concern based on their capacity to care, maybe not. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author is framing autism as a curse or affliction and not considering the possibility of a different outcome, it's likely A.\n"
