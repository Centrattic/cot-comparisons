Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son was diagnosed with autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects of the decision. The author is making a choice based on the challenges their first child faces, including autism, health issues, and the impact on their family's life. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into similar or worse circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the decision to have children is deeply personal and involves weighing potential hardships against the desire to raise a family. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential future child, which is a valid consideration. They mention sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the risk of the next child having similar challenges. It's understandable that someone might feel this way after experiencing such difficulties.\n\nOn the other hand, others might argue that the author is making assumptions about what the next child's life would be like. Autism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective could be seen as pessimistic or based on fear. Additionally, the decision to not have another child might be viewed as a personal choice rather than something morally wrong, but some might argue that life's challenges are part of what makes it meaningful, and it's not for one person to decide another's quality of life.\n\nThe author's wife thinks he's being selfish, which suggests a conflict in their relationship. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the wife's perspective. The decision isn't illegal or against moral principles universally. People have different values, and this is a personal choice about family planning. The key is whether the author's reasoning is considered selfish or a valid personal stance.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to make reproductive decisions is considered a personal freedom. The author isn't causing harm by not having another child; he's choosing not to do so based on his circumstances. So, labeling him as \"the asshole\" might not be justified. However, some might argue that he's dismissing the potential for a new child to have a good life despite challenges, which could be seen as ethically questionable.\n\nUltimately, this seems to be a matter of personal values and perspectives. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's no clear moral obligation to have more children despite challenges, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong). The decision is a personal one, and while it's a tough choice, it doesn't necessarily make him an asshole.\n"
