Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The main points are the author's concerns about the child's challenges and their decision to not have another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on their family's current situation. They mention the son's autism diagnosis, sleep issues, health problems, and their own fears about another child facing similar struggles. They love their son but are worried about the potential quality of life for another child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic individuals have the same challenges. The author is worried about bringing a child into a world where they might face bullying or difficulties. However, this is a personal decision and doesn't necessarily mean they are wrong. People have different values and thresholds for what they consider acceptable for their children.\n\nThe wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels it's the opposite. The question is whether this decision is morally wrong. It's important to note that the author isn't discriminating against autistic people; they have one and love him. They're choosing based on their ability to cope and their desire not to impose hardship.\n\nThere's also the argument that parents can't predict the future. The second child might not have autism or might have a better quality of life. But the author is making a call based on current information and their family's capacity. It's a tough call, but it's their right to make that choice.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are prioritizing their family's well-being and making a decision based on their experiences. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
