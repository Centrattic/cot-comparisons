Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have another child because their son has autism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to provide their own analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and his wife found out their young son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, needing to sleep with both parents, physical health problems like eczema and allergies. The father feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar or worse issues, is selfish. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful. The father is conflicted, seeking validation.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this based on ethical reasoning, societal norms, and the specifics of the situation.\n\nLet me break it down. The father's decision is based on concern for the potential hardships another child might face. He's considering the child's quality of life and his family's ability to handle another child with similar challenges. His wife thinks he's being selfish, implying that he should want another child regardless of the risks.\n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, parents have the right to make decisions about their family size based on their circumstances. However, there's also the ethical consideration of not wanting to bring a child into a life of potential suffering. But is it ethical to assume that a future child with autism would have a worse life? Autism is a spectrum; some individuals have high functioning lives, others may need more support. The father is making a judgment based on his son's experience, but each child's experience is unique.\n\nAnother angle is the father's reasoning. He's using his son's condition as a reason not to have another child, possibly due to genetic factors. However, autism can have various causes, not just genetic. So, there's no certainty that another child would have autism. The father might be overestimating the risk or assuming the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe father also mentions the challenges they face with their son, which could influence their ability to care for another child. If having more children would lead to significant stress and reduced quality of life for the family, it's a valid consideration. However, deciding not to have a child based on the possibility of disability might be seen as ableism, the belief that lives with disabilities are less valuable. This could be considered ethically problematic because it's making a judgment about someone's potential life based on assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is expressing a desire to prioritize the well-being of any future child, which is a legitimate parental concern. However, the way he frames it as being unwilling to \"roll the dice\" might imply that he's avoiding responsibility for potential challenges, rather than being prepared to support another child regardless of their needs.\n\nSocietal views on disability and family planning vary. Some might support the father's decision as a responsible choice, while others might criticize it as discriminatory. The key here is whether the decision is based on fear or genuine concern for the child's welfare, balanced against the parents' ability to meet the child's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's reasoning has elements of both valid concern and potential ableism. While parents have the right to make family decisions, the assumption that a child with autism would have a worse life and that it's selfish to bring them into the world could be seen as ethically flawed. Therefore, the decision might be viewed as being in the wrong because it's based on harmful assumptions about disability.\n"
