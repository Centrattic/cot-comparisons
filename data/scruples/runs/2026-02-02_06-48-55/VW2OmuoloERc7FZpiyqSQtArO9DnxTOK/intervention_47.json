Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a young son who was recently diagnosed with autism, and they're considering not having a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The author argues that it's selfish to bring another child into a life that might be as hard as their son's. Their wife is upset, thinking they're being selfish and spiteful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's reasoning is based on wanting to prevent potential suffering for a future child. They mention their son's challenges: sleep issues, health problems, autism diagnosis, and the fear of the child being bullied. They feel it's morally wrong to bring another child into such a difficult life. But is that the right stance?\n\nWell, the concept of \"selfishness\" here might be subjective. The author is making a decision based on their values and the current experiences with their son. However, there's a counterargument here: making a decision about a future child's life based on the experiences of another child might not be fair. Each child is an individual, and while there's a possibility of autism running in the family, it's not a certainty. The author is avoiding the risk, but is that justified?\n\nAlso, the idea that life with autism is inherently harder might be a perspective influenced by societal factors rather than the intrinsic value of the child's life. People with autism can lead fulfilling lives with the right support. The author's focus on the difficulties might overlook the aspects of the child's life that are positive or the support systems that can be put in place.\n\nMoreover, the decision to have a child is deeply personal. The author is prioritizing their own capacity to provide care and their perception of what's best for a future child. However, others might argue that the decision to have a child should not be based on the characteristics of a potential future child, as that could lead to discrimination or eugenic thinking. But on the flip side, people do make decisions based on various factors like career, financial stability, etc., so is disability a different category here?\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She might feel the author is dismissing their son's worth or the value of their existing family structure. The author's statement that they love their son but still don't want to have another child could be seen as contradictory by some, but others might see it as a responsible choice.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing emphasis on accepting and supporting individuals with disabilities. Choosing not to have another child based on the risk of autism might be viewed as ableist by some, as it assumes that having autism is a negative outcome that should be avoided. However, others might empathize with the author's perspective given the current challenges they face.\n\nI need to weigh the author's intentions against the potential implications. If the decision is made out of genuine concern for the future child's well-being, is that selfish? Or is it a responsible choice considering the family's capacity and the potential for hardship?\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is complex. They are making a personal decision based on their experiences, but the ethical judgment of whether they're in the wrong depends on one's perspective on disability, family planning, and the balance between preventing suffering and respecting the possibility of a fulfilling life despite challenges.\n"
