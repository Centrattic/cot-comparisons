Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has an autistic son with various challenges and doesn't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they love their son but don't want to bring another child into a potentially difficult life. They mention the child's autism, physical issues, and the impact on their family's life. The author feels it's selfish to do so, but the wife disagrees.\n\nOn the other hand, people with disabilities often emphasize that their lives have value and that not wanting to have children because of the risk of disability can be seen as ableist. It could imply that lives with disabilities are not worth living, which can be hurtful. The author's reasoning might stem from the challenges they've faced, but others might argue that they're making a judgment about the quality of life for a future child based on their own experiences.\n\nI should also consider the ethical implications. Deciding not to have another child based on medical conditions is a personal choice, but it's important to acknowledge that disability activists stress that such decisions can perpetuate stigma. The author might be projecting their current struggles onto a potential future child without knowing how things could change or how the child might perceive their own life.\n\nThe author is also considering the possibility of the next child having similar issues, which might not be guaranteed. Autism is a spectrum, and each individual's experience is different. However, the author's concerns are based on real challenges they're facing now.\n\nIn terms of the question, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether it's considered selfish or a valid personal choice. The author is expressing their feelings honestly, but the wife's perspective is that the author is being harmful. The challenge is balancing personal choice with societal values about disability.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the reasoning could be seen as devaluing the life of a person with autism. However, others might argue it's a personal decision. But given the context of disability rights, the answer might lean towards A. Still, there's nuance here. The author's intention is to protect future children from hardship, but the reasoning could be problematic. So, considering the broader implications, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
