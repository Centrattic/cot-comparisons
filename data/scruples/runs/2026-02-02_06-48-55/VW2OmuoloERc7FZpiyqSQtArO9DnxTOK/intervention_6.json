Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their current son has autism. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about bringing another child into the world who might have similar challenges. They mention sleep deprivation, eczema, allergies, and autism. The author feels it's selfish to do so, given the hardships they're already facing.\n\nBut wait, is it wrong to consider the well-being of a potential child? The author is making a choice based on their current experiences. They love their son but are worried about the quality of life for another child. On the other hand, autism is a part of who someone is, and many individuals with autism live fulfilling lives. The author's perspective seems to stem from fear and the stress they're under. However, it's important to recognize that autism isn't a curse; it's a neurodevelopmental difference. The decision to have children is personal, but making it based on the assumption that another child would have a worse life because of autism could be seen as making a judgment about the value of that life. The author's wife might feel they're dismissing their son's worth. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because they're making a negative assumption about the potential for another child's life based on their son's struggles. But I should also consider that the author is making a choice for their family's circumstances. However, the key point is whether it's morally wrong to avoid having another child for this reason. Some might argue it's their right, but others would say it's discriminatory. I think the answer depends on societal views on disability and quality of life. The author's reasoning could be seen as problematic because it's based on the idea that a life with autism is less worth living. Hence, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
