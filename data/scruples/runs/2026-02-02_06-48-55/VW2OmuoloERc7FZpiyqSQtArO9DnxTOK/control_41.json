Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. The question is a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife discovered their young son has autism, though it's usually diagnosed at 4. They mention the child has significant challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and they get only 3-5 hours of sleep a night. The author feels it's selfish to have another child who might face similar hardships. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is justified in his decision. The user wants a yes or no answer (A for wrong, B for not wrong). \n\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental condition, not a disease. It's part of the autism spectrum, and many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author is making a decision based on the challenges they've experienced with their first child. But is this decision selfish? The author is expressing concern for the potential suffering of a future child, considering the genetic possibility of autism and the existing health issues. However, autism isn't a genetic certainty; it's influenced by both genetics and environment. The author is generalizing based on their first child's experience, which might not be the case for a second child. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that bringing another child into the world with potential hardships is selfish. But is that actually the case? Some would argue that parents have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. Others might see it as not considering the possibilities of a different experience with another child. The wife's perspective is that he's being spiteful, which might stem from feeling that the decision is unfair to their first child or that he's not giving the second child a chance. \n\nAnother angle is the quality of life. The author is concerned about the child's well-being, but autism itself isn't a hardship; societal attitudes and accessibility can impact that. The author might be conflating autism with the challenges faced due to co-occurring conditions (eczema, allergies, etc.) which might not be genetic. \n\nEthically, it's complex. Deciding not to have another child due to the possibility of autism could be seen as ableist, implying that a life with autism is not worth living. However, the author is focused on the potential suffering from both autism and the other medical issues. But without knowing the specifics, it's speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. Some might see it as a valid personal choice based on their experiences, while others might argue it's prejudiced against autistic individuals. The answer isn't straightforward, but the author is making a personal decision based on their family's situation. The key is that he's not wrong for having this perspective, but others might criticize it. The answer would likely be B (not wrong) because it's a personal choice based on his feelings and circumstances, even if others disagree.\n"
