Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son has autism. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their wife have a young son diagnosed with autism. He has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and they're getting very little sleep. The author is concerned that a second child might also have autism or similar difficulties and doesn't want to bring another child into such a hard life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. The author's reasoning is based on wanting to prevent another child from suffering. They mention seeing autistic kids being bullied, which adds to their concern. On the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish. \n\nI need to think about whether it's ethical to decide against having another child based on the possibility of autism. Autism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author assumes that another child would have a similar or worse experience, which might be a generalization. \n\nAlso, the author is making a decision based on their current child's hardships. But does that justify not having another child? It's a personal choice, but the argument here is about potential suffering. However, every child could face various difficulties, not just autism. Should the possibility of any hardship prevent someone from having children?\n\nAnother angle is the author's perspective on autonomy. They believe they are acting in the best interest of a future child by not bringing them into a potentially difficult life. However, others might argue that the decision to have a child is a personal one and that the author is projecting their own fears onto a potential future child. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife wants another child, which introduces a conflict between the two partners. The author's decision could affect the wife's wishes and their relationship. That might be another point\u2014respecting each other's desires in family planning.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, utilitarianism might look at maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering. If the author believes having another child would lead to more suffering, they might think it's right to avoid it. However, if the potential child could have a fulfilling life despite challenges, maybe not. Deontological ethics might focus on the duty to not make such decisions based on assumptions about another's life.\n\nThere's also the issue of ableism. By deeming autism a curse or affliction, the author might be contributing to a negative view of disabled individuals. This could be seen as disrespectful to the autistic community, who often advocate for acceptance and support rather than prevention.\n\nThe author's reasoning could be seen as problematic because it's based on fear and past experiences, not considering the potential child's right to exist. However, the decision to have children is a personal one, and people have the right to make choices based on their values and circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns are valid, the decision to avoid having another child based on the possibility of autism might be considered ethically questionable by some due to the assumptions made and potential ableism. However, others might respect the author's right to make personal choices about their family. The answer could be either way, but the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the answer is A (yes), it's because they are being selfish and contributing to ableist thinking. If B (no), it's because it's their personal choice based on their experiences. I need to decide which side weighs more here.\n"
