Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have an autistic son with a lot of challenges\u2014he's causing them sleep deprivation, has eczema, allergies, and the dad is worried about having another child who might also have autism and similar difficulties. The dad doesn't want to have a second child because he doesn't want another child to go through that. The wife thinks he's being selfish and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The dad's reasoning is based on concern for the child's well-being. He's saying that bringing a child into the world knowing they might have a hard life is selfish. But is that justified? On one hand, the decision not to have another child is a personal choice. On the other hand, some might argue that he's making a judgment about potential future children's lives without knowing if they'd lead a good life, even with challenges.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not all autistic people have the same experiences. Some lead happy, fulfilling lives. The dad is assuming that another child would have a worse life, which might not be accurate. Also, he's connecting autism with other medical issues (eczema, allergies), but those aren't necessarily linked. So he might be conflating different issues.\n\nThe dad mentions the potential for bullying, which is a societal issue rather than an inherent part of being autistic. That's a separate problem that society needs to address, not a reason to avoid having a child.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that he's being selfish. The dad is prioritizing his own comfort and resources over having another child. But is that selfish? Or is it a responsible decision based on their current situation? It's a balance between personal capacity and the child's potential well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive rights and autonomy. The dad has the right to make decisions about his family size. However, the question is whether his reasoning is ethically sound. If he's making a decision based on the potential for a child's suffering, that's different from making a decision based on personal convenience or fear.\n\nIn ethical terms, there's a debate about procreation ethics. Some philosophers argue that it's wrong to bring a child into existence if their life will be worse than non-existence. Others argue that it's better to have a life with some challenges than none at all. The dad's stance aligns with the \"pro-life\" angle of not wanting to risk a child's suffering, but the complexity comes from the uncertainty of the child's future.\n\nAlso, the dad is making assumptions about the future child's quality of life based on his son's experience. But each child is unique. The son might have a different experience as he grows, and the next child might not have autism at all. The dad might be overestimating the likelihood of another child having the same issues.\n\nIn terms of the question of being an \"asshole,\" it's subjective. If the dad is making a decision based on genuine concern for a child's future well-being, some might see that as caring. Others might see it as making a call about the value of a potential life, which can be controversial.\n\nThe key points are: the dad's decision is based on concern for the child's future, but he's making assumptions about the child's life quality. The ethical dilemma is whether it's right to decide not to have a child because of the potential for challenges. There's no clear right or wrong, but the dad's reasoning is based on his perspective and current experiences.\n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? The answer might depend on whether his reasoning is considered valid. If the community or a moral framework deems that it's acceptable to make such a decision based on concern for the child's well-being, then he's not the asshole. But if the decision is seen as discriminatory or dismissive of the value of people with autism, then he might be in the wrong. The question hinges on societal attitudes and personal ethics.\n"
