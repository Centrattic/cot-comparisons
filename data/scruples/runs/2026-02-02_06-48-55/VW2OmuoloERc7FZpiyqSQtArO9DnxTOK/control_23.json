Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son is autistic. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author's son was recently diagnosed with autism, has eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. The author is concerned that another child might have similar challenges and doesn't want to bring another child into such a hard life. The wife is upset, saying the author is selfish.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal decisions about family planning. The author's reasoning is based on the potential suffering of a future child. They don't want to risk another child having a hard life because of autism or related issues. But others might argue that not wanting to have another child because of the possibility of disability is being discriminatory.\n\nI need to consider the nuances. Autism is a spectrum, and many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective is influenced by their current experiences, which are difficult. However, deciding against having more children based on the possibility of disability is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. It's about their values and what they're comfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, some might see it as a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse. But the author isn't saying autism is bad; they're concerned about the hardships their son faces. They also mention physical issues like eczema and allergies, which might be separate from autism. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also part of the situation. She thinks the author is selfish, so there's a conflict in their relationship. But the question isn't about the wife's reaction, but the author's choice. The key is whether the author's reasoning is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and values. They are not in the wrong for choosing not to have another child due to concerns about potential challenges, even if others disagree. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a common ethical perspective that might see this differently. However, personal choice in family planning is generally respected unless it involves harm to others. Since it's about their own family's future, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
