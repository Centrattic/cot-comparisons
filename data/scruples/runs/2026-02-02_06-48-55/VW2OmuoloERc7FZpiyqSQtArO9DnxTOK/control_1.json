Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again. The author and their wife found out their son is autistic, and they're not surprised because they noticed signs. The son has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and autism. The author doesn't want a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels it's the right decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the arguments. The author's main point is that they don't want to bring another child into the world who might have a difficult life, similar to their son's. They mention seeing kids with autism being bullied in school and not wanting to risk that for another child. On the other hand, the wife feels the author is being selfish and spiteful. \n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. The author is making a decision based on their family's circumstances. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for another potential child. It's a personal decision about family planning. Is it wrong to choose not to have more children based on existing challenges?\n\nIn terms of rights and autonomy, individuals have the right to make decisions about their family size. The author isn't making a decision that harms others but is based on their own values and considerations. However, some might argue that life is valuable regardless of challenges, and not wanting to have another child could be seen as a negative view on life with disabilities. But others might support the decision as a responsible choice considering their current situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Autism is a spectrum; not every child would have the same level of difficulty. The author is worried about potential, not certainty. Also, the decision isn't to have another child but to choose not to, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She might feel the author is dismissing the possibility of a positive experience with another child. But the author is prioritizing the child's well-being and their family's capacity to handle more challenges. \n\nI think the answer depends on societal views. If society supports the idea that life is worth living despite challenges, then the author might be seen as the asshole. But if society respects personal choice and the challenges faced, then the author isn't in the wrong. Given the personal nature of the decision and the lack of harm to others, the author is probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
