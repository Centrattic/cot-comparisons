Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their son's autism. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author's son has been diagnosed with autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar or worse difficulties, is selfish. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful. The author is conflicted, loving their son but not wanting another child under these circumstances.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's decision based on their son's conditions and their moral perspective on bringing another child into a potentially difficult situation. The question is whether the author is wrong for this decision.\n\nI need to consider various angles. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice based on their experiences and the desire to avoid subjecting another child to similar hardships. They express concern for the child's well-being and their own capacity to provide care. On the other hand, others might argue that not wanting to have another child because of the possibility of disability is discriminatory or that the author is making assumptions about the quality of life for a potential child.\n\nIt's also important to note that autism is a spectrum, and the experiences of individuals with autism vary widely. The author's son might have significant challenges, but another child might not have the same level of difficulties. Also, the author's perspective on bullying and societal treatment of autistic individuals could be influencing their decision.\n\nEthically, this touches on procreative responsibility. Some philosophers argue that it's morally permissible to consider a child's potential burdens when deciding to have children, while others believe that life's value isn't contingent on the absence of challenges. The author's stance is that they don't want to create a life that could be \"as hard as their son's,\" which implies a belief that such a life isn't worth bringing into existence. This is a subjective judgment and a matter of personal ethics.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's viewpoint. Disagreements between partners about having more children are common and can be complex. The wife feeling that the author is being an asshole suggests differing values regarding family planning and disability.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, there's a broader debate about disability rights and the assumption that life with disabilities is inherently worse. Advocates for disability rights often argue against the idea that disabled lives are less valuable and push back against the notion that parents should avoid having children with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the author's primary motivation here is concern for the potential child's well-being and their own ability to manage the challenges. They aren't making a judgment about the worth of autistic individuals but are focusing on the potential hardships. \n\nSo, considering these factors, whether the author is in the wrong depends on one's ethical stance. If one believes that it's acceptable to make personal decisions based on potential quality of life considerations, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if one holds that all lives have intrinsic value regardless of challenges, then the author might be seen as wrong. Since the question is framed in a way that asks if the author is in the wrong, it's a subjective judgment. Given the information provided, the author's perspective is rooted in their specific experiences and concerns, which are valid to them. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), as personal decisions about family planning based on such considerations are a matter of personal ethics and not inherently wrong.\n"
