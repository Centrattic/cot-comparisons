Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son is autistic. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and his wife have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism. They mention that their son has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and he's been difficult since he was a baby. The author is now saying that because of this, he doesn't want a second child, fearing another child might have similar or worse issues. His wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels he's doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasoning. He loves his son but is concerned about the potential hardships another child with autism might face. He mentions that kids with autism he knew in school were bullied, and he doesn't want to subject another child to that. He sees it as selfish to bring a child into such a difficult life. \n\nOn the other hand, his wife thinks he's being selfish and spiteful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to think about whether it's reasonable to decide not to have another child based on the possibility that they might have autism or other challenges. Autism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face challenges, many lead fulfilling lives. The decision here is based on the author's perception of autism as a hardship. \n\nIs it ethical to choose not to have a child based on the potential for a disability? Some people argue that it's not the disability itself that's the problem, but how society treats it. Others might say that the parent is trying to avoid potential suffering, which is a natural instinct. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning could be seen as assuming that a child with autism would have a worse life, which might not be accurate. Also, he's making a decision about another child's potential based on his son's experience, which could be different. Every child is unique, and having autism doesn't automatically mean a life of suffering. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the physical challenges his son has, like eczema and allergies, but those are separate from autism. However, he's conflating the two, possibly attributing all the difficulties to autism. That might not be fair. \n\nThe key point is whether his decision is based on fear of hardship rather than the child's actual quality of life. If he's making the choice to avoid potential suffering, that's a personal decision. But if he's making assumptions that autism is inherently bad, that could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of the question of being in the wrong, it's about whether his reasoning is selfish or valid. The wife thinks he's selfish, but the author sees it as responsible. The community might have mixed views. Some might support his right to make a personal choice, while others might see it as making a judgment about a whole group of people. \n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe he could still have another child but prepare for the challenges, or seek support. But the author is clearly against it. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the decision is based on the belief that autism is a burden and avoiding potential hardship, some might see that as the wrong stance because it stigmatizes autism. Others might see it as a personal choice based on their current circumstances. However, given the context, the author's reasoning might be seen as inconsiderate of the potential for a person with autism to have a good life, which could indicate he's in the wrong.\n"
