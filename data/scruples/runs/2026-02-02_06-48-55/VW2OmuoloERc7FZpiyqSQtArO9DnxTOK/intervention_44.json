Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's son has been diagnosed with autism, and he's decided not to have another child because he doesn't want another child to go through similar struggles. His wife disagrees, saying he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal choice based on his family's experiences. He's concerned about the child's well-being and the challenges they might face, like the physical and emotional toll on the parents and the child's potential struggles. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's place to decide what's best for a future child's quality of life? People have different values. Some might argue that life, even with challenges, has value, and it's not up to the parents to choose against bringing a child into the world based on potential difficulties. Others might support the author's decision, emphasizing the importance of parental preparedness and the well-being of existing children.\n\nThe author mentions his son's severe symptoms: sleep issues, allergies, eczema, and autism. He's worried about another child facing similar or worse challenges. But autism is a spectrum, so each child's experience can vary widely. Assuming the next child would have the same or worse conditions might be an overgeneralization. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She thinks he's being selfish. This could reflect differing views on family planning and the responsibilities of parenthood. The author is prioritizing avoiding hardship, while the wife might see bringing a child into the world as a positive, regardless of challenges.\n\nIs the author being selfish? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's making a decision based on his values and experiences. On the other, some might see it as a failure to accept the potential joys and challenges of another child's life. The question is whether his reasoning is valid or if he's overstepping by deciding for a future child.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's intent isn't malicious; he loves his son and is worried about another child's well-being. However, the decision to not have another child is a personal choice. But the term \"asshole\" implies a moral failing. If the author is making an informed and empathetic decision, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's making assumptions about another child's potential life quality without knowing them, maybe he is.\n\nThe author might be projecting his son's experiences onto a potential future child, which isn't fair since each child is unique. But he's acting in what he believes is the best interest of future children. It's a complex ethical issue without a clear answer. The community's response would likely be mixed, but in the AITA framework, the judgment often depends on intentions and whether the action is unkind or selfish.\n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his family's specific situation. However, there's a valid argument that he's being overly cautious or making assumptions. But since he's acting from a place of love and concern, maybe he isn't the asshole. So, the answer would be B.\n"
