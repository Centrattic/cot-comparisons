Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a second child because their first son has autism. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences and concerns about their son's condition. They mention that the son has autism, which is confirmed by a specialist, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might face similar or worse hardships.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing a desire to avoid potentially subjecting another child to a difficult life. They believe that bringing a child into a world where they might face bullying and other challenges is morally wrong. This perspective might be seen as compassionate, as they're trying to prevent suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that making a decision based on the possibility of another child having autism is discriminatory. It's important to recognize that many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author's stance could inadvertently contribute to stigma or a devaluation of people with autism. Additionally, the decision affects the spouse's wishes, which could strain their relationship. The wife's feelings of being an \"asshole\" towards the author indicate conflict here.\n\nI should also consider the ethical principle of autonomy. The author has the right to make personal choices about their family. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential for ableism in the reasoning. The author's view that a life with autism is inherently \"hard\" and not worth bringing into existence may not account for the individual experiences and happiness of people with autism.\n\nMoreover, the decision to have children is a significant one, and personal circumstances play a role. The author's reasons are rooted in their current challenges, which are valid concerns. However, it's important to differentiate between the desire to avoid additional stress and the ethical judgment about another person's life quality.\n\nIn summary, while the author is not necessarily unethical for making this personal decision, the reasoning might reflect a misunderstanding or undervaluing of the potential life of a future child. The answer should weigh both the intent to prevent suffering and the potential for discriminatory thinking.\n"
