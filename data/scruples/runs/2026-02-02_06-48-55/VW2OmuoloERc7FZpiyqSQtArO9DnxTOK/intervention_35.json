Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child due to their first son's autism diagnosis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their son is autistic and has multiple challenges\u2014sleep issues, physical health problems, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The author feels that bringing another child into the world with similar difficulties would be selfish and that the child might have a hard life, referencing bullying experiences from school. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal choice, parental responsibility, and societal attitudes toward autism. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder; it's not inherently a \"bad\" condition. Each individual's experience with autism varies widely. Some people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author is making an assumption that a future child would have the same or worse challenges, which isn't necessarily true. However, the decision about having more children is deeply personal and involves weighing individual circumstances.\n\nThe author's concern is about the potential hardships the next child might face. But is it fair to label this decision as selfish or wrong? On one hand, the author is prioritizing their ability to care for their existing child and considering the child's future quality of life. On the other hand, others might argue that the author is making a judgment about autism based on negative stereotypes and not the child's actual experience. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing their personal decision based on their experiences and concerns. While the wife sees it as selfish, the author's intention is to avoid what they perceive as a difficult situation. Since the decision is personal and the author is not making harmful choices (like abandoning their son or refusing support), it's more about differing values. In AITA scenarios, being in the wrong often relates to violating social norms or being unkind. Here, the author isn't acting unkindly or harming others, just making a difficult choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the author's statement about not wanting to bring a child into a hard life could be seen as a negative view of autism, which some might find problematic. But given that the decision is the author's to make and it's not causing current harm, the answer is likely B.\n"
