Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. They mention the challenges they face, like sleep deprivation due to the child's behavior, medical issues, and concerns about the child being bullied. The wife thinks they're being selfish, but the person feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect. The decision to have another child is personal and involves weighing various factors. The author is worried about the potential hardships another child with autism might face. But does that make them an asshole? Well, people have different reasons for not having more children, and it's not necessarily selfish if they're considering their child's well-being and the family's capacity to handle more challenges. However, there's a nuance here. Autism is a spectrum, and the author is making a generalization that another child would have \"a life as hard as my son's.\" That might be an oversimplification. Each child is unique, and while there's a genetic component to autism, it's not guaranteed that a second child would have similar or worse conditions. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on fear of future difficulties rather than a direct harm to the existing child. The wife's perspective is that the author is being spiteful, but the author's stance is about not wanting to subject another child to potential suffering. However, the phrase \"bringing a person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's\" could be seen as a version of the \"selfish gene\" argument, which is a controversial topic. Some might argue that the parent is overestimating the negative aspects and underestimating the family's ability to adapt and support another child. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is concerned about their son's experience. If the existing child is struggling, the parent might genuinely want to avoid another child having the same or worse struggles. But is it fair to assume another child would have the same level of difficulty? Also, the parent is making a choice based on their own capacity to handle the situation, not out of disregard for their child's condition. \n\nThe term \"asshole\" here is subjective. The parent is expressing a valid concern, even if it's not the only possible viewpoint. The key is whether the decision is made with malicious intent. Since the parent loves their current child and is making the choice out of care, it's more about personal values than being in the wrong. The wife's reaction might be due to differing priorities\u2014maybe she doesn't see the decision as selfish or wants to focus on the potential for a happy life despite autism. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is a personal one based on their experiences and family situation. However, the answer might depend on how the community views the reasoning. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no. Based on the analysis, the answer is B.\n"
