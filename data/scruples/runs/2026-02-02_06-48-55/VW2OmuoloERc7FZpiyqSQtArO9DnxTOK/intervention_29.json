Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their son is autistic. The author mentions the challenges they face, like sleep deprivation, health issues, and the child's autism. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences with their child. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships another child might face. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish, but the author doesn't see it that way.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while the child has challenges, it's not inherently a bad thing. The author's reasoning is based on the assumption that another child would have similar or worse issues. However, autism is not a disease but a neurotype, and people on the spectrum can have fulfilling lives. The decision to have children is personal, but making it based on avoiding potential hardships could be seen as ableist, implying that lives with disabilities are less valuable.\n\nThe author is projecting their current struggles onto a future child without knowing if another child would even have autism. Also, the decision to have a second child is a family matter. The wife's perspective is important here too; the author is making a unilateral decision that affects the entire family, including their current child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing concern for their child's well-being and their own capacity to handle another child's needs. But is it fair to categorize this as selfish? It could be seen as a realistic assessment of their resources and capabilities. However, it's also important to recognize that every family has challenges, and the decision to have more children isn't solely based on avoiding potential problems.\n\nIn terms of ethics, deciding not to have a child because they might have disabilities raises questions about valuing different types of lives. It's possible the author is acting out of love, but also unintentionally devaluing the lives of people with disabilities. That could be considered wrong, hence the \"asshole\" aspect. But the decision is also personal, so there's a balance between respecting individual choices and challenging ableist thinking.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong if their reasoning is based on the idea that an autistic child's life is worse, which could be seen as ableism. However, they are making a personal choice based on their experiences. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer would likely be A (Yes) because their reasoning could be considered discriminatory, even if their intentions are to protect future children.\n"
