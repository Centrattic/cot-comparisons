Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have an autistic son with a lot of challenges, including sleep issues, health problems, and they don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. Their wife is upset, thinking they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's concern is about not wanting to bring another child into a life they perceive as difficult. But is it ethical to decide not to have another child based on the potential for suffering? On one hand, the author is prioritizing the well-being of a future child, trying to prevent them from facing challenges. On the other hand, people with autism have value and lead fulfilling lives, and the decision might be based on assumptions about the future child's experience.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so another child might not have the same level of challenges. The author is making a decision based on their son's specific experiences, but each child is unique. Also, the author might be projecting their current stress onto future possibilities, which could be an overestimation.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, thinking the decision is selfish. Maybe she values having another child despite the potential challenges. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing their own fears over their wife's desires, but they also have valid concerns about their son's well-being.\n\nSocietally, there's a debate about whether it's ethical to have children given the uncertainties of life. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author isn't choosing to harm anyone but is opting out of a risky situation. However, it's also important to recognize that people with disabilities can have happy lives, and the author might be underestimating their ability to support another child.\n\nIn terms of the question of being an \"asshole,\" the author is expressing their genuine concerns, even if they're not in line with their spouse's views. The key here is whether their reasoning is morally wrong. They're not making a harmful choice directly but are deciding against having another child. The debate is more about the justification rather than being in the wrong outright. The answer might depend on whether the decision is based on valid concerns versus prejudice against autism.\n"
