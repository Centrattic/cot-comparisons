Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have another child after learning their son has autism. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife found out their young son has autism, which they were expecting. They already have a lot of challenges with their son\u2014sleep issues, health problems, etc. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, especially if the next child might also have autism or similar issues. The wife disagrees, but the author is standing by their decision. The question is whether the author is being selfish or making a reasonable choice.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. Autistic individuals can lead fulfilling lives, but society often imposes challenges like bullying mentioned. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential sibling. The decision to have children is deeply personal and involves weighing various factors like family dynamics, resources, and personal beliefs.\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a choice based on their experiences and fears. They might be prioritizing the well-being of potential future children by avoiding possible hardships. On the other hand, some might argue that deciding against another child based on autism's heritability could be seen as stigmatizing or not accepting their son's condition, even if it's a difficult path.\n\nHowever, the author isn't making a decision based on their son's autism alone but because of a combination of factors\u2014autism, health issues, and the stress of caring for a child with such needs. They love their son but are considering the potential risks for another child. The decision to have children is complex, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It's important to respect individual choices here.\n\nThe key points are the author's intentions, the specific reasons (not just autism but multiple challenges), and the fact that they are making a personal decision based on their current circumstances. While some may have a different opinion, it's not necessarily wrong for the author to choose against having another child given their reasoning. So the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
