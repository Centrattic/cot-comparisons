Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting another child because their first son is autistic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son has been diagnosed with autism, and there are other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and so on. The author is saying that they don't want another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles, and they don't want to take the risk. The wife is upset because she thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful.\n\nSo, the core issue here is the author's decision to not have another child based on the possibility that the second child might also have autism or other difficulties. The author feels it's selfish to bring a child into a difficult life, while the wife thinks they are being an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice about their family based on the challenges they're already facing. They are concerned about the well-being of a potential future child, which is a valid consideration. On the other hand, autism is a spectrum, and having one autistic child doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be the same. Also, the author's reasoning could be seen as assuming that an autistic child's life is inherently difficult or that having autism is a negative thing, which is a point of contention in the disability community. The author is focusing on the challenges rather than the potential for a fulfilling life that the child could have. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's wife's perspective. If the couple had previously wanted a second child, the author's sudden change of heart could be seen as dismissive of the wife's wishes. The author might not be considering that their wife might see autism as part of the child's identity rather than a hardship, and that she might be more open to having another child regardless.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"selfishness.\" The author is prioritizing their own emotional and physical capacity to care for children, which is understandable given the current stress. But is that selfish? It's a balance between personal well-being and family planning. However, the author is projecting the child's future and making a judgment about their quality of life, which can be seen as a form of ableism\u2014assuming that a life with autism is less valuable. \n\nIn the disability rights community, there's a strong emphasis on neurodiversity and the idea that autism is not a disability to be cured but a different way of being. So, the author's perspective might be at odds with that view, which could be why some would say they're in the wrong for not wanting another autistic child based on their current child's struggles. \n\nBut then again, the author is also dealing with real, tangible challenges. Sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the emotional toll can be overwhelming. Deciding not to have another child in that situation might be a practical decision. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not the practicality. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is seen as selfish or protective. If the author is making a choice based on their belief that an autistic child's life is too difficult, some might argue that's inconsiderate of the potential child's identity and the wife's wishes. Others might sympathize with the author's position given the challenges they're already facing. \n\nIn the end, I think the author's comments could be seen as problematic because they imply that an autistic life is less desirable and make a decision that might not align with the wife's desires. That could be considered selfish or inconsiderate, hence being in the wrong. However, others might take a more neutral stance. But given the context of the question and the possible implications of their reasoning, the answer is likely A.\n"
