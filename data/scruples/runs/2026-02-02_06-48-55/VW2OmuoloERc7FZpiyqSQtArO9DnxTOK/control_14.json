Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son is autistic. The author lists several challenges: autism diagnosis, sleep issues, health problems. They feel it's selfish to have another child who might face similar hardships. The wife disagrees, calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. The author is making a personal choice based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for another child. On the other hand, autism doesn't define a person's worth. The author's fear might stem from societal stigma or their own observations, but autism is a spectrum with varying experiences. Some autistic individuals live fulfilling lives.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to suffer, but they're assuming the next child would have the same issues. However, autism isn't deterministic. Even if there's a genetic component, each child is unique. The author might be overgeneralizing. Also, the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author isn't being malicious; they're prioritizing their child's potential well-being, though their reasoning could be flawed.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish. But is it selfish? The author is making a choice for their family's circumstances. However, they might be projecting their own fears onto future children. Additionally, the author's view that autism equates to a \"hard life\" might not align with the actual experiences of many autistic people who advocate for acceptance. The author's stance could reflect ableism, even if unintended.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal decision, but their reasoning contains elements that could be considered harmful. They might benefit from understanding neurodiversity and the potential for a fulfilling life with autism. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" the answer hinges on whether their intent and reasoning are valid. Given that the author isn't harming anyone and is making a personal choice based on their experiences, the answer might lean towards them not being the asshole. But their reasoning could still be flawed. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats.\n"
