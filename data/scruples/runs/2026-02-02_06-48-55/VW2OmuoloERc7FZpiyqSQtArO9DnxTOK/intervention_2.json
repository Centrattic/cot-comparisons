Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to their son's autism. The author argues that they don't want to bring another child into the world if they might face similar or worse challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author's decision is based on a desire to prevent their future child from experiencing a difficult life. They mention their current son's challenges, including autism, lack of sleep, health issues, and the possibility of bullying. The author's stance is that it's selfish to have another child under these circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's wife sees this as selfish. The key question is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Is it ethical to not have another child because of a concern about potential future hardships? \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective seems to be influenced by their current experiences with their son. However, autism is not a disease to be \"cured\" or avoided; it's a neurodiverse condition. The author's decision might stem from a place of wanting to protect the future child, but it's also possible that they're making assumptions about what life with autism is like for others.\n\nThere's a philosophical debate here about whether it's right to make decisions based on potential suffering. Some might argue that life's value isn't determined by the absence of hardship, and that the author is projecting their son's specific struggles onto all future children. Others might see the author's decision as a responsible choice to avoid potentially overwhelming circumstances.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction is also important. She might feel that the author is dismissing the possibility of a positive experience with another child or is unfairly generalizing their son's experiences. The conflict here isn't just about autism but about differing views on parenthood and risk.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might view the author as making a selfish choice by not wanting to take the \"risk\" of another child's potential hardships, while others might empathize with the author's desire to avoid repeating a difficult situation. It's also worth considering that the author is making a personal choice that doesn't harm others directly, so the concept of being an \"asshole\" might be subjective.\n\nUltimately, the answer depends on whether one views the decision as selfish or as a reasonable choice based on personal experiences and projections. The author's reasoning could be seen as flawed if they're not considering that another child might have a different experience or that the challenges aren't insurmountable. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal and complex, and it's possible both perspectives have merit.\n"
