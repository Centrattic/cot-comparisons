Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first child is autistic. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. The father feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar or worse conditions, is selfish. The wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's reasons for not wanting another child. He's concerned about the potential suffering of another child and the family's ability to cope. On the other hand, the wife thinks he's being selfish. The question is whether the father is in the wrong.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and people with autism can have varying levels of ability and challenges. It's important to note that not all autistic individuals have the same experiences. Some live independent lives, while others need more support. The father is making an assumption that another child would have a similarly hard life, which might not be accurate. However, his decision is based on his current experiences and the desire to prevent potential suffering.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions about their family size based on their circumstances and beliefs. However, making assumptions about future children's lives based on a sibling's condition could be seen as problematic. It's also important to consider that the family's ability to support children might improve over time, and they might not anticipate how they'll adapt.\n\nBut the father's reasoning is rooted in a place of concern for the child's well-being. He's not making a decision out of selfishness, but out of trying to prevent what he perceives as a difficult life. However, others might argue that it's not for him to decide the value of another person's life or their potential happiness. They might say that by not having another child, he's making a judgment based on current knowledge, not future possibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is also considering the family's capacity to care for multiple children with special needs. If they already have significant challenges with one child, adding another could strain resources, time, and emotional energy. That's a valid concern for any parent.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that he's being selfish, perhaps because he's not considering the possibility of another child not having the same issues. Or maybe she feels that he's giving up on the idea of expanding the family without sufficient reason. However, the father isn't giving up on the child's potential but is making a choice based on his current understanding.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a lot of debate about disability and family planning. Some argue that parents shouldn't decide based on disability, while others respect the right to choose based on personal circumstances. The father's stance could be seen as a personal choice, but if he's making a judgment about the quality of life for another child, that might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nBut then again, the father is not choosing to prevent a child from existing because of a disability; he's choosing not to take on the perceived burden. The line between personal choice and discrimination can be blurry here. If he's making a decision that could prevent someone from existing because of a potential disability, some might see that as ethically problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's reasoning is complex. He's trying to balance his love for his son with the potential risks of having another child. While his concerns are valid, the assumption that another child would have the same issues and that their life would be equally difficult might lead others to believe he's being judgmental. Therefore, there's a case to be made that he's not in the wrong because he's making a personal decision based on his family's situation. However, others might argue that he's making a harmful assumption about people with autism. Given the options, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the decision is a personal one, but this is a nuanced issue with valid arguments on both sides.\n"
