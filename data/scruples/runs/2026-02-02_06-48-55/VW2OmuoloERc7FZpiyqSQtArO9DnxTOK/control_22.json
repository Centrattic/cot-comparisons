Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The author explains that their son has autism, along with other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, and allergies. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation, while the wife thinks they're being selfish and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the potential hardships a second child might face. On the other hand, the wife disagrees. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, so not every child they have would necessarily have the same level of challenges. The author is making an assumption about future children, which might not be accurate. However, their decision is based on real experiences and the desire to prevent suffering. \n\nSome might argue that it's selfish to withhold the possibility of having another child because they might have a different experience. Others might see it as responsible to consider the well-being of a future child. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions: they want to avoid subjecting another child to similar struggles. But they might be overgeneralizing, as each child is unique. The question is whether making such a decision based on one child's experience is morally wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a debate about procreation and responsibility. Some believe that parents should not bring a child into the world if they anticipate significant suffering, while others think that life's challenges are inherent and not a reason to avoid having children. \n\nThe author is not being malicious; they're acting out of love and concern. However, they might not be considering that their second child could have a different experience. The wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish by not wanting another child, possibly not considering that they could provide a loving home regardless. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the decision is considered selfish or responsible. Since the author is making a choice based on their circumstances, even if flawed in assuming the second child's situation, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument that life's difficulties are part of the human experience and not a reason to avoid having children. \n\nGiven that, the author's stance is a personal moral choice, and while it might be controversial, it's not inherently wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
