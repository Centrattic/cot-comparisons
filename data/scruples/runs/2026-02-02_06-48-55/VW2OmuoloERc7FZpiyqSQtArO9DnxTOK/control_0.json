Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a second child because their first child has autism. The person wrote that they love their son but don't want another child due to the potential hardships similar to their son's. They mention the challenges like sleep issues, health problems, and the risk of autism. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels it's not selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's decision is based on their current experience with their son. They are concerned about the potential suffering of a future child. But is it right for them to make that decision based on one child's situation? Autistic individuals have a wide range of experiences. Some lead full lives and are happy. The author assumes that another child would have a similarly difficult life, which might not be accurate. Also, they mention that autism can be manageable with the right support. \n\nThen there's the aspect of autonomy. The author and their wife initially wanted two children, but the author changed their mind. The wife feels hurt, thinking it's selfish. But the author is prioritizing the well-being of a future child. However, is it ethical to deny the possibility of another child based on assumptions? Also, the author is making a decision that involves both partners' desires. The wife's feelings are important here.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of disability and quality of life. The author seems to view autism as a burden, which could be seen as ableist. However, the person is expressing their personal feelings and fears. It's important to recognize that autism is a part of neurodiversity, and many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might not align with the neurodiversity movement, which advocates for acceptance and support rather than seeing autism as a disability to be avoided.\n\nThe author's concerns about potential suffering are valid, but they are making a decision based on their current experience. The question is whether it's wrong to not want another child because of the risk of similar challenges. There's also the argument that parents should be prepared for the challenges of raising a child with autism and that support systems can make a difference. The author's decision might be seen as avoiding responsibility rather than seeking ways to support another child if they have autism.\n\nIn terms of selfishness, the author is prioritizing their own comfort and the potential well-being of a future child. However, not wanting to have another child is a personal choice. But if the decision is based on the belief that having autism is inherently worse, that could be problematic. The wife's perspective is also important here, as the decision affects their relationship and shared goals.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's reasoning might stem from a place of fear or misunderstanding. While they have the right to make personal life decisions, their views on autism could be considered outdated or biased. The key issue is whether it's wrong to not want another child because of the possibility of autism, given that autism is a natural part of human diversity and not inherently a negative trait. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for perceiving autism as a curse and making a decision based on that perception without considering the potential for a positive life for another child with autism.\n"
