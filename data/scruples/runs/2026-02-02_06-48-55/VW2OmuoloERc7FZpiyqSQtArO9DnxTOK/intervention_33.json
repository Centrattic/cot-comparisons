Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a son with autism, and they mention other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. He feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar issues, is selfish. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish and spiteful.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author wrong for making this decision? Let's break it down.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder. Just because one child has autism doesn't mean another child will have the same condition or severity. The author is assuming that another child would have a similarly hard life, which might not be accurate. However, he's making a personal choice based on his current experiences.\n\nOn one hand, every parent wants to provide the best for their children. The author is concerned about the potential hardships another child might face, which is a valid concern. But is it selfish? Or is it a responsible decision based on their family's situation?\n\nOn the other hand, deciding not to have another child because of the possibility of genetic or environmental factors leading to similar challenges could be seen as making a judgment about the value of life for someone with disabilities. This touches on ethical issues about disability and the right to exist. The author might be projecting his fears onto a future child, which could be unfair since each child is unique.\n\nAlso, the author mentions his son's physical health issues. But he's conflating autism with those medical conditions. Maybe the eczema and allergies aren't related to autism. So, is he making a decision based on all factors, or is he generalizing?\n\nAnother angle is that the author and his wife had always wanted two children. Now, he's changing his mind based on his son's diagnosis. His wife disagrees. This could be a conflict between personal ethics and familial expectations. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to risk another child's well-being, but his wife sees that as selfish.\n\nThere's also the aspect of ableism. By deciding against having another child because of the possibility of disabilities, the author might be implying that a life with autism or other challenges is not worth living. That's a controversial stance because it devalues the lives of people with disabilities. However, the author does express love for his son, so it's not entirely clear.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing the potential well-being of a future child over the personal desire to have a second child. That might be seen as a responsible choice, but it's complicated by the assumption that another child would have similar issues. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the decision is based on a genuine concern for the child's future and the family's ability to cope, it's a personal choice. However, if it's based on a biased view that life with autism is inherently worse, then it could be problematic. The line between responsible parenting and ableism is thin here.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is based on valid concerns or on a devaluation of lives with disabilities. The author might be in the wrong if he's making a judgment about the value of a potential child's life based on disability. But if he's simply choosing not to have another child due to the stress and challenges, that's his personal decision. The key is whether his reasoning is discriminatory.\n\nGiven that the author mentions not wanting to bring a child into a hard life, which can be seen as a form of ableism, I lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue it's a personal choice. However, the ethical implications about disability rights and the right to exist are significant here.\n"
