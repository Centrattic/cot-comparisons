Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son is autistic. Let's break this down. The author mentions their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. They also mention a lot of other challenges like lack of sleep, eczema, allergies, and violent thrashing. The author feels that bringing another child into the world might mean the child could have similar or worse issues, so they don't want to have another child. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author thinks they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a decision based on their son's condition. They're not trying to harm someone but are concerned about the future child's well-being. On the other hand, some might argue that not wanting a child because of a potential disability is discriminatory or eugenic. But the author isn't denying their son's worth; they love him deeply. They're just worried about the quality of life for another child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some people with autism face challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. The author might be generalizing based on their son's specific struggles. It's also possible they're projecting their son's difficulties onto a hypothetical future child, which might not be accurate. However, the author is trying to avoid what they perceive as an unfair burden on another child.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"selfishness.\" The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author sees it as being protective. The key here is intent. The author's motivation is to prevent potential suffering, which is a form of parental concern. However, deciding not to have a child for this reason might be seen as a personal choice rather than inherently wrong. \n\nThere's also the aspect of medical advancements and societal support. Maybe the author is underestimating how things could improve for a future child, or overestimating the challenges. But that's a common part of any parenting decision, not unique to autism.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to choose not to have a child because of the risk of disability? This is a debated topic. Some argue that parents shouldn't decide against children with disabilities to avoid inconvenience, while others believe it's a personal choice. The author isn't choosing to prevent their son from living but is making a decision for future children. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author's stance isn't malicious. They're acting out of love and concern. However, others might view it as a form of ableism, even if unintentional. But given the context, the author is not in the wrong because they're making a personal decision based on their experiences and the specific challenges they face. The answer is B.\n"
