Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has an autistic son with a lot of challenges, and he doesn't want to have a second child because he's worried the next child might have similar issues. His wife thinks he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is making a decision based on his son's autism and other health issues. He's concerned about bringing another child into a potentially difficult situation. He loves his son but is conflicted about having another child. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels he's making a responsible choice.\n\nNow, considering possible angles. On one hand, the author is prioritizing the well-being of a future child, considering the existing challenges. On the other hand, some might argue that he's making assumptions about another child's life. Also, the wife's perspective is that he's being selfish, which could imply he's not considering their shared desires or the possibility of supporting another child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so having one autistic child doesn't guarantee another will be the same. The author's reasoning is based on his son's specific issues, but each child is unique. He's also taking into account the family's ability to cope with multiple children with similar needs. However, deciding not to have another child because of potential risks could be seen as a personal choice rather than selfishness.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or ethical perspectives. Some might see it as a valid decision based on the family's circumstances, while others might think it's a form of ableism, assuming that a child with autism would have a worse life. The author's argument is that he doesn't want the child to suffer, but others might argue that parents can provide support regardless of the child's needs.\n\nConsidering the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions and impact. The author's intention is to avoid potential suffering, but the impact is on his wife's feelings and their future family planning. The wife's reaction is important here, as it's a shared decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not about the wife's feelings.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by choosing not to have another child. Personal decisions about family size are generally considered personal. However, the way he's expressing his thoughts, using terms like \"selfish\" and \"asshole,\" might affect how others perceive him. The key is whether his reasoning is flawed.\n\nI think the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as he's making a personal decision based on his circumstances and concerns for the future child's well-being. However, it's a sensitive topic where opinions can vary. The wife's perspective is valid too, but the question is about the author's wrongness, not the relationship dynamics.\n"
