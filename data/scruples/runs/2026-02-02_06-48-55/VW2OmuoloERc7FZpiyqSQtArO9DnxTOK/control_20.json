Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The context is that the author found out their young son has autism and related health issues, and they don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to go through a similarly hard life. Their wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels they are not.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author loves their son, but the challenges of raising an autistic child with additional health problems (sleep issues, eczema, allergies) are significant. They are considering not having another child because they don't want another child to face such difficulties. The wife disagrees, calling them selfish. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nNow, the possible perspectives. On one side, the author is making a decision based on their current experiences and the potential hardships another child might face. They might feel that bringing a child into a situation where they might suffer is unethical. On the other hand, others might argue that the author is making assumptions about future children's lives and that not having children is a personal choice, but choosing not to have another due to fear of disability could be seen as discriminatory or ableist. They might also argue that the author is projecting their son's specific challenges onto any future children, not considering that autism is a spectrum and each child is different. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that autism is only diagnosable at 4, but the specialist was confident. So maybe the diagnosis is certain, but the severity might vary. The author's concerns about bullying and societal treatment of autistic individuals are valid, but they might be overestimating the challenges their future child would face. \n\nThe question of whether this is selfish hinges on the ethical stance one takes. Some might say it's reasonable to consider quality of life when deciding to have children, especially given the known challenges. Others might see this as a form of ableism, implying that disabled lives are not worth living, which is a harmful attitude. \n\nThe author's wife thinks they're being selfish, which suggests a conflict in their relationship. However, the author's intention is to avoid causing suffering, which is a common parental instinct. The dilemma is between the desire to prevent future suffering versus the right to reproduce without bias based on potential disabilities.\n\nLooking at ethical theories, a utilitarian might calculate the overall happiness and suffering. If the author believes that another child would have a lower quality of life, they might argue it's better not to bring them into existence. However, others might counter that this is a form of negative utilitarianism and could lead to valuing certain lives over others.\n\nIn terms of medical ethics, the author might be making an assumption about the future child's quality of life based on their brother's experiences, which could be seen as not respecting the autonomy of the future child. They can't decide for the child what kind of life is worth living. This ties into the concept of \"wrongful life\" lawsuits, where someone is born with a disability and suffers because of it, but the ethics of preventing such births are debated.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal choice. The author is not forcing their wife, so it's a mutual decision. The wife's perspective is important here, and the conflict between them is part of the situation. The author's stance might be considered valid if they are making a decision based on their current experiences and future risks, but their wife's disagreement shows differing views.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the ethical viewpoint. If one believes that it's unethical to make assumptions about a future child's quality of life and that all lives have inherent value regardless of disability, then the author might be seen as the asshole. However, if one prioritizes preventing potential suffering and acknowledges the challenges the author is facing, the author might not be in the wrong. The key is whether the author's decision is based on ableist thinking or a genuine desire to avoid hardship. Given the author's statement that they love their son and don't want another to suffer similarly, it's a complex situation without a clear right or wrong.\n"
