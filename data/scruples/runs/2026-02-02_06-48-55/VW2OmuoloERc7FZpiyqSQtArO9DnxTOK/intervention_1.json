Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The author has a son who was recently diagnosed with autism and is deciding not to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The author's wife thinks he's being selfish and an asshole, but he feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on their current experiences with their son. They mention that the child has autism, severe eczema, allergies, sleep issues, and behavioral problems. The author is concerned about bringing another child into such a difficult situation. They argue it's not selfish because they don't want another child to suffer. But is it wrong to make such a decision based on the possibility of genetic predisposition?\n\nAutism is a spectrum and not purely genetic, though genetics can play a role. However, the author is making a broad assumption that another child could have the same issues. They might be overestimating the risk or not considering that each child is unique. Also, the author is projecting their son's specific challenges onto a future child, which might not be accurate. But from the author's perspective, they're trying to protect future children from hardship.\n\nOn the other hand, deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of disability could be seen as ableist. It assumes that a life with autism is inherently less valuable or more suffering than others. Society often stigmatizes disabilities, leading people to make such decisions without considering the child's potential for a fulfilling life. The author's wife might feel that this decision is discriminatory, implying that their son's life isn't worth living or is worse than others'.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is based on a valid concern or a harmful assumption. The author loves their son but is making a choice based on fear of future suffering. However, the decision not to have another child is a personal one, and while it's controversial, it's ultimately their choice. But the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of moral philosophy, there's the conflict between deontological ethics (duty-based) and consequentialism. A deontologist might argue that it's wrong to discriminate against potential people based on disability. A consequentialist might look at the outcomes, considering if the author is acting in the best interest of future children. However, the author's decision is based on their perception of likely outcomes.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"right to life\" and whether it's ethical to deny a potential person existence based on possible disabilities. Some philosophers argue that it's not the parent's place to decide the value of another person's life. The author's decision might be seen as a form of eugenics, even if unintentional.\n\nBut the author is not making a decision to terminate a pregnancy; they're choosing not to have another child. The ethics here are nuanced. However, the author is framing their son's life as having significant challenges and not wanting another child to face similar issues. This could be seen as valuing potential future children's well-being by avoiding suffering, but it's also a judgment on the quality of life of people with autism.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction is important too. She sees the author as selfish, which suggests a differing perspective on the matter. The author's reasoning might be based on personal experience, but it's possible they're underestimating their ability to cope with another child's needs or overestimating the likelihood of similar issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal one, but the way they frame it\u2014assuming that another child would have a worse life\u2014could be considered harmful. It's possible they're in the wrong not because they chose not to have another child, but because of the underlying ableism in their reasoning. However, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering societal norms and ethical perspectives, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) due to the ableist implications, even if their intentions are to protect future children.\n"
