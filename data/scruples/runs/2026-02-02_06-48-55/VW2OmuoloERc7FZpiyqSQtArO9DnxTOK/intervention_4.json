Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post where a parent is reconsidering having a second child after their first child is diagnosed with autism. The parent feels it's selfish to bring another child into a situation that might be as difficult, and the wife is upset with them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a decision based on their son's challenges, which include autism, sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. They argue that they don't want to impose a similar hardship on another child. But is that decision morally wrong?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some individuals face significant challenges, others lead fulfilling lives. However, the author is making assumptions about their future child's experience based on their son's. There's a risk of generalizing, which might not account for individual differences. Also, the decision to have children is personal, but using disability as a reason to not have more children could be seen as ableist, implying that a life with autism isn't worth living. That's a problematic assumption.\n\nThe author's concern about the child's well-being is valid, but the approach might stem from a lack of understanding about autism or fear of additional stress. They might be projecting their son's struggles onto a potential future child without considering that each child is unique. The wife's reaction suggests she feels the decision is unfair and judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are real and deserve empathy. They're under a lot of stress. But is it \"wrong\" to feel that way? Ethically, it's complex. While the author has the right to make reproductive choices, the reasoning could be seen as discriminatory. There's a difference between making a decision based on personal circumstances and making a judgment about the value of a life with disabilities.\n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the community often looks at intent and impact. The impact here could be hurtful to their wife and potentially stigmatizing towards people with autism. The author's reasoning might not be malicious, but it could be perceived as such. The key point is whether their decision is based on a reasonable assessment of their ability to care for another child, or if it's based on a devaluation of the life of someone with autism.\n\nI think the author's concern is not entirely unfounded, but the way they're framing it\u2014suggesting that having a child with similar challenges is inherently worse\u2014might be where they're in the wrong. The decision itself is personal, but the reasoning could be considered harmful. So, leaning towards answer A (they are in the wrong) because of the ableist undertones in their reasoning.\n"
