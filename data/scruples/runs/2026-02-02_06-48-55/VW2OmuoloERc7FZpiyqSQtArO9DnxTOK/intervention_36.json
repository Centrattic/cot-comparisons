Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again. The author and their wife have a young son who was just diagnosed with autism. They mention the challenges they face, like sleep deprivation, eczema, allergies, and the boy's difficult behavior. They love their son but don't want a second child because they don't want another child to have a hard life like their son. The wife thinks the author is selfish and spiteful, but the author thinks they're being responsible.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting another child based on their son's autism. Let me break this down. The author is making a decision based on their current experiences and their perception of what their son's life is like. They believe that having another child with similar issues would be unfair to the child and the family. On the other hand, the wife thinks they're being selfish, implying that they're making a judgment about their son's life quality, which might not be fair.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so the next child might not have the same level of challenges. The author is speculating that a second child could be \"as bad or worse,\" which is uncertain. But the author is not certain; they're just making a choice based on their current knowledge and fears. Is it wrong to make a decision about having more children based on the potential risks and challenges they've seen with their first child?\n\nSome might argue that the author is devaluing their son's life by implying that his life is too hard, even though they love him. Others might say it's reasonable to consider the family's well-being and future challenges. The author is expressing a concern for the potential suffering of another child and their own ability to cope. However, there's also the aspect of medical advancements and support systems that could help a future child, which the author might not be considering. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. If the author is making a unilateral decision without considering the wife's wishes, that could be problematic. But the story doesn't say if they've discussed it thoroughly or if the wife is against the decision. The author is asking for advice, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for their reasoning.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's reasoning is based on a valid concern or prejudice. They do love their son, but their fear of future suffering for another child might stem from their current stress. There's also the ethical consideration of not wanting to bring a child into the world with a potentially difficult life. However, it's also possible that the author is projecting their current difficulties onto the next child without considering that circumstances could be different or that they might adapt better with more experience.\n\nIn the end, personal decisions about having children are complex. The author is not making a decision that's against the law or a moral wrong in a universal sense. However, in the context of their family, if the decision is causing conflict and not considering the wife's perspective, that could be where the issue lies. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reasoning. I think it's a nuanced situation where the author's intentions are to protect future children, but they might be making assumptions about autism and their son's quality of life that others might disagree with. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for debate.\n"
