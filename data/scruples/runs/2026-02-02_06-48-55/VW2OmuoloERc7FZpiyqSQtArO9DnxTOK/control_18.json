Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their son is autistic and have decided against having a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar hardships. Their wife thinks they're being selfish and spiteful, but the author feels they're being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is making a decision based on their son's challenges\u2014Autism diagnosis, sleep issues, health problems. They feel that bringing another child into a situation where there's a risk of similar issues is selfish. The wife disagrees, calling them an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the author is prioritizing the potential suffering of a future child. They're saying it's better not to have another child if there's a risk of the same or worse difficulties. On the other hand, their wife might feel that they shouldn't let the current child's challenges affect their decision about future children, especially since Autism isn't always the same in every individual. Also, there's the aspect of family planning and the wife's feelings being hurt.\n\nI should consider if the author is being selfish. The author argues they're being responsible by avoiding potential harm. But is it fair to assume that another child would have the same issues? Autism is a spectrum, and while there's a genetic component, it's not guaranteed. So the author is making a decision based on a possibility, not certainty.\n\nAnother angle is reproductive rights and personal choice. The author has the right to decide how many children they want. However, the decision is based on the characteristics of their existing child. Is it ethical to withhold a child from existence due to fears about potential future suffering? Philosophically, there are debates about this. Some might say it's a responsible choice, others might say it's limiting the possibility of a different experience for another child.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their son's physical issues like eczema and allergies. Maybe they're overgeneralizing, thinking that another child would have similar health problems. But each child is unique, even within the same family.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important too. She feels the author is being spiteful, maybe because they're implying that their son's life is not worth living or that having another child could avoid such challenges. That's a sensitive point. The author must be careful not to devalue the worth of their son, who is already living with these challenges. However, the author is not saying their son's life is bad; they love him deeply but are concerned about the future for another child.\n\nIs the author's reasoning valid? They love their son but are worried about the potential for another child to have a hard life. It's a tough balance between wanting to avoid suffering and the ethical implications of deciding not to have a child based on possible genetic factors.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that life is inherently challenging, and that the author is overestimating the difficulties. Others might support the decision as a form of parental responsibility. There's also the issue of eugenics, though the author isn't making a broad statement about autism but rather a personal decision based on their family's experience.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being selfish or making a responsible choice. If they're acting out of genuine concern for a future child's well-being, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they're being overly pessimistic or letting fear of difficulty affect their decision, it could be seen as selfish. Since the author clearly loves their son and is thinking about the future, it's a complex situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their values and experiences, even if others disagree. But I need to make sure there's no element of devaluing their son's life, which the author doesn't seem to do\u2014they express love for him.\n"
