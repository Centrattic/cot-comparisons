Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that they have an autistic son with additional challenges, and they don't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through the same struggles. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but they feel they're doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is making a personal decision based on their experiences. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for a potential second child. The question is whether it's wrong to decide against having another child because of the possibility of similar challenges.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while some people with autism do face difficulties, many lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective is influenced by their current child's specific challenges\u2014eczema, allergies, sleep issues\u2014which might not be typical for all autistic individuals. The decision to not have another child could be seen as a personal choice, but there's a fine line between making an informed decision and making assumptions about future children's lives.\n\nThe author mentions societal attitudes, like bullying, which is a valid concern, but it's also important to recognize that societal attitudes are changing and improving. There's also the aspect of genetic factors\u2014if one child is autistic, the risk for another might be higher, but it's not certain. The author is using their experience as a basis, which is understandable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, everyone has the right to make reproductive choices. However, some might argue that deciding against having a child based on potential disabilities could be seen as valuing certain lives over others, which touches on ableism. But the author's intention is to prevent suffering, which is a protective instinct.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she feels the author is being selfish, possibly because she might still want another child or believes that having a child with autism is acceptable. The author's stance is their own, but it's possible they're projecting their current struggles without considering that future children might have a different experience.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong here. The author is making a personal decision based on their family's situation. While their concerns are valid, the decision to not have another child isn't inherently wrong. However, it's important to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the potential for ableist thinking. The answer would depend on whether the decision is based on the child's best interest or societal biases. Given the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
