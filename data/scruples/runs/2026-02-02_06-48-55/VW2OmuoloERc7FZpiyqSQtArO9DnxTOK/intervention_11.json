Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons. They have a son with autism, significant health issues, and sleep problems. They feel bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish. They love their son but are concerned about potential hardships. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish. The author isn't against having kids entirely but changed their mind after the first child's challenges. People with autism can lead fulfilling lives, and it's not certain the next child would have the same issues. Also, deciding against a child based on potential disabilities might be seen as making a judgment about someone's worth before they're born.\n\nBut the author is making a personal choice based on their experiences. It's their right to decide their family size. However, some might argue that not wanting to take the risk because of potential difficulties is a form of ableism, assuming that a life with autism is inherently harder or less valuable.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects. The author isn't discriminating against their current son but is concerned about future children's well-being. However, it's possible they're projecting their current struggles onto a future child, which might not be accurate. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about disability and family planning.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is complex. They're acting out of love and concern, but there's a risk of underestimating the potential for a fulfilling life for a child with autism. Whether it's \"in the wrong\" is subjective. Some might say it's a valid choice, others might see it as selfish. I think the answer hinges on whether the decision is made with full understanding of possibilities versus fear.\n"
