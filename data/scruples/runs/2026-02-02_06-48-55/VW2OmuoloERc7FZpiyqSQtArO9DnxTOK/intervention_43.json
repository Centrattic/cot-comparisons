Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first child is autistic. The author lists several challenges their son faces, including autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the stress on their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on the potential suffering of a future child. They argue it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. But is that a valid reason? There's a balance between protecting future children and the rights of the parents to decide their family size.\n\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental condition. While it can come with challenges, many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's concerns might be based on their current experience with their son, but each child is different. Assuming another child would have similar or worse struggles could be a generalization. Also, the author mentions that autism is only diagnosable at 4, but the specialist made a confident diagnosis earlier. However, the author's own intuition led them to suspect autism, so maybe they have some preconceived notions.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish. That's a key point. The decision affects the family dynamics and the wife's wishes. The author might not be considering their partner's perspective here, which could be part of the problem. Decisions about having children are usually mutual, and making that choice unilaterally could be seen as disregarding the wife's desires.\n\nThere's also the ethical consideration of eugenics. Deciding not to have another child based on potential disabilities can be controversial. It might imply that a life with disabilities isn't worth living, which is a form of ableism. However, the author is not making that judgment but rather considering the quality of life based on their current experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is prioritizing the well-being of potential children and their own family's ability to care. They mention sleep deprivation and physical ailments, which are significant stressors. It's a reasonable concern to not want to overload an already strained family.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer could depend on societal values. If the decision is based on fear of hardship rather than the child's inherent worth, some might argue it's acceptable. However, others might see it as discriminatory. Additionally, the author's wife's feelings are important. The decision affects her too, and not involving her fully in the decision-making might be the real issue here.\n\nI think the key points are the potential ableism, the impact on the wife, and the assumption that another child would have similar issues. The author's reasoning might be flawed in assuming the future child's life would be as hard, and not considering their partner's perspective could be a significant mistake. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of these factors.\n"
