Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father found out his son has autism, which he wasn't surprised by. The son has various challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the father is concerned about bringing another child into the world who might have similar or worse difficulties. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels he's acting in a responsible way.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the father is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal choice, parental responsibility, and societal attitudes towards disability. \n\nThe father's decision is based on his belief that it's not fair to bring another child into a life of hardship. However, this raises ethical questions. Is it right for a parent to decide against having another child based on the possibility of disability? Some might argue that life's value isn't measured by ease, and that every person has inherent worth regardless of challenges. Others might see his decision as a responsible choice given the known risks.\n\nThe father's concerns are valid, as raising a child with autism can be demanding. However, his reasoning that it's selfish to have another child because of the potential for hardship might be seen as problematic. It could imply that people with disabilities have a lower quality of life, which is a controversial stance. The wife's reaction suggests that she sees his decision as dismissive of the positive aspects of their son's life, even with challenges.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, some might argue that the father is making a judgment about the child's worth before even considering the possibility of another child having a different experience. Autism is part of the person's identity, and many in the community advocate against the idea that autism is a burden. The father's view could be seen as ableist, though he may not intend that.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is making a personal choice about family planning. He's considering the well-being of any future children and their potential struggles. It's a deeply personal decision, and while others might disagree, it's his right to make that choice. However, the way he frames it as not being selfish might be where the conflict arises. He might be overlooking the support systems, love, and positive experiences that come with raising a child with autism.\n\nIn summary, while the father's decision is his to make, his reasoning might be considered flawed or harmful from some perspectives. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the answer options are A or B, and the analysis shows that while his choice is personal, his reasoning could be seen as problematic, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) for his reasoning, but there's nuance here. However, the community often debates such questions, and sometimes the \"asshole\" label is given for decisions that seem to devalue people with disabilities. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
