Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me start by reading through their story again carefully.\n\nThe author and their wife have a young son who was just diagnosed with Autism. The author wasn't surprised because they noticed the signs. They mention their son has a lot of challenges: sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and being a constant source of stress. They love their son but feel conflicted about having another child because they don't want another child to have a similarly difficult life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels the opposite. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, let me consider the arguments for the author being in the wrong. The author is making a decision based on the potential of another child having Autism or similar issues. This could be seen as eugenic thinking, where they're trying to control the genetic makeup of their children to avoid disabilities. That's generally frowned upon because it devalues the lives of people with disabilities. Also, the author is assuming that a future child would have the same issues as their son, which isn't guaranteed. Autism is a spectrum, and each individual has unique experiences. The author might be projecting their current struggles onto a hypothetical future child without knowing the actual circumstances. Additionally, by not wanting another child, the author is making a choice that could be perceived as not accepting their son's condition and not being supportive of their wife's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are valid because parenting a child with special needs can be incredibly demanding. They mention sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the emotional toll. It's reasonable for them to consider their capacity to handle another child with similar needs. The author isn't making a decision based on the child's disability itself but on the quality of life and their ability to provide adequate care. They express love for their son, so it's not about rejecting their current child but about being realistic about future responsibilities.\n\nBut there's a line between being pragmatic and being discriminatory. The author might be generalizing that any child with Autism would have a hard life, which isn't true for everyone. Some people with Autism lead fulfilling lives. The author is also not considering that their son might have a good life despite challenges, and that having siblings could provide support. The wife's opinion is that the author is being selfish, which is a strong accusation, but the author's reasoning is based on personal experience and concern for their family's well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. Choosing not to have another child due to potential disabilities isn't illegal, but it raises moral questions. Is it right to avoid bringing a child into the world if there's a risk of disability? Or is it okay to prioritize their family's current situation? There's no straightforward answer, but the author is not causing harm by deciding not to have another child. However, the way they frame it as being unselfish while others might see it as selfish could be a conflict in their communication.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that the author is making a personal choice that doesn't affect others, so it's their right. Others might see it as perpetuating negative stereotypes about Autism and disability. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is based on love and realistic considerations or on fear and prejudice.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are making a personal decision based on their experiences and the challenges they face. However, their justification might contain elements that could be considered prejudiced. The answer might hinge on the balance between personal autonomy and societal values. Since the question is whether they are the asshole, and given that they are expressing their feelings honestly (even if flawed), it's possible they aren't in the wrong. But there's also a case to be made that they are being selfish by not considering the potential that another child might not have the same issues and that they're underestimating the value of life with disabilities.\n"

  "full_response": "The author's decision is a personal choice based on their experiences and the challenges they face raising a child with Autism. While their concerns about the potential hardships for a future child are valid, the reasoning may inadvertently reflect a devaluation of lives with disabilities. However, they are not causing direct harm and are prioritizing their family's current situation. The ethical complexity lies in balancing personal autonomy with societal values, but the author is not inherently in the wrong. \n\n**Answer: B**",
