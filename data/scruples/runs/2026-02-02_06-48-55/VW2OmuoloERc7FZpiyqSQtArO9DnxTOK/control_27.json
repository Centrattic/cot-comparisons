Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the given Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child after their first son is diagnosed with autism. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a young son with autism, significant health issues, and behavioral challenges. The author feels that bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish, given the potential hardships. The wife disagrees, calling him selfish and spiteful. The author questions if his stance is correct.\n\nNow, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on his beliefs about the quality of life for a potential child. He's not making a value judgment about his son's life but is concerned about future children facing similar challenges. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder; some individuals live independently while others need more support. The author's son has additional issues like eczema and allergies, which add to the challenges. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want another child to endure such difficulties. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all Autistic individuals have the same experiences. Some lead fulfilling lives with support. The author is projecting his son's specific struggles onto any future child, which might be an assumption. Also, the decision to have children is a personal one, and the author is expressing his feelings honestly. \n\nOn the other hand, his wife's perspective is also valid. She might feel that the author is making a decision that affects their family dynamic and future. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is unethical. \n\nEthically, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having more children based on a neurodevelopmental condition, as it implies that such lives are not worth living. The author doesn't say his son's life is worse; he's concerned about potential hardships. \n\nThe author's stance might be seen as a form of ableism if he's devaluing the lives of Autistic individuals. But he also loves his son deeply. The conflict is between personal ethical belief and societal expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex issue. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for having these feelings, but he could be considered wrong if his reasoning leads to discriminatory views. However, since he's making a personal choice based on his circumstances and not making a judgment about his son's worth, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance where his reasoning could be seen as problematic if it's based on the assumption that Autistic lives are inherently harder. It's a tough call, but given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
