Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. They provided the full post where the author explains their situation and feelings. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points in the post. The author found out their son is autistic, mentions various challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the impact on their life. They feel that bringing another child into the world with similar struggles would be selfish. The wife disagrees, but the author believes they're not being selfish.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so it's important to note that the experience can vary. The author is making a decision based on their current child's difficulties. But is that a valid reason to not have another child? The author is expressing concern for the potential well-being of a future child, which could be seen as a protective stance. However, others might argue that not wanting another child because of the possibility of autism isn't necessarily wrong since it's a personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, some might see the author's reasoning as problematic. Autism is a natural part of human diversity, and the author's decision could be perceived as devaluing the lives of autistic individuals. The author's focus on the hardships might overlook the positive aspects and the support that can be provided. Also, the decision to have children is deeply personal, but there's a societal expectation to not discriminate based on disability. \n\nThe author's statement that they don't want another child who might have a hard life could be seen as not accepting that life's challenges come in different forms. It's possible that the author is projecting their own experiences with their son onto a hypothetical future child without considering that the next child might have a different experience. \n\nHowever, the author is also considering their own and their family's capacity to provide care. They are not choosing not to have a second child due to the child's potential identity or worth, but because of the practical and emotional strain. The question is whether prioritizing their own ability to cope is selfish or a valid consideration.\n\nIn the AITA community, the common response might be that the author is in the wrong if they're making a judgment about the value of life based on autism. But others might empathize with the author's difficult situation and the stress involved. The key is whether the author's reasoning is considered harmful or just a personal choice. \n\nI think the author's reasoning is based on their current challenges but might not take into account the diversity of experiences among autistic individuals. However, the decision to have children is complex, and personal circumstances play a role. The answer could depend on how one views the balance between personal capacity and societal values. Since the author is not making a blanket statement against autism but is considering their specific situation, it's a nuanced situation. The AITA community often sides against people who seem to devalue others' lives, but in this case, the author is making a personal choice based on their circumstances. However, the way the author frames the decision, focusing on the \"hard life\" of an autistic child, could imply a negative view of such lives, which might be seen as the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for implying that an autistic life is not worth having, even if their intention is to protect a future child.\n"
