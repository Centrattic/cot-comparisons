Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to autism. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have a son with autism, confirmed by a specialist. The kid has multiple challenges: sleep issues, health problems like eczema and allergies. The author is worried that another child might have similar or worse issues, so he doesn't want to have a second child. His wife thinks he's being selfish.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether it's wrong to decide against having another child based on the possibility that the child might have autism or similar challenges. The author argues that it's selfish to bring a child into a hard life, while the wife thinks he's being spiteful.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. From the author's standpoint, he's trying to protect future children from potential suffering. He's seen the difficulties with his son and doesn't want others to go through that. On the other hand, some might argue that it's not up to the parents to decide the value of a potential life, and that many autistic individuals and their families find ways to thrive despite challenges. Also, the decision to have children is personal, but the author's reasoning might be seen as discriminatory if he's rejecting the possibility of another child with disabilities solely based on their potential hardships.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that autism is a burden. The author's view might not account for the fact that many autistic people lead fulfilling lives, and that the quality of life depends on support and acceptance. By not wanting another child with autism, he's making an assumption about the child's future, which might not be equitable.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering the practical challenges, like the time and resources required. Parents have the right to make decisions based on their family's capacity. But is it selfish to prioritize their current situation over the potential of another child's life? It's a tough balance between personal responsibility and societal ethics.\n\nI should also think about the implications of the author's reasoning. If applied broadly, this logic could lead to eugenic thinking, which is ethically problematic. Everyone has some form of challenge, and it's impossible to predict a child's life outcomes. Therefore, the author's decision, while personal, might be seen as not wrong in terms of his right to choose, but ethically questionable because it devalues people with disabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might hinge on whether the decision is considered selfish or a reasonable personal choice. Different people have different views on this. However, many would argue that deciding against a child based on disability is ethically wrong because it perpetuates stigma and underestimates the value of diverse lives. So, the author might be in the wrong (A) for this reason.\n"
