Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering not having a second child because their first son has autism, and they don't want another child to go through similar challenges. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, so the author is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author loves their son but is concerned about the potential hardships another child might face if they have autism. They mention their son's difficult behaviors, health issues, and the possibility of being bullied. The key question is whether it's wrong to decide against having another child based on these factors.\n\nI should consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the author is prioritizing the well-being of a future child by not wanting to subject them to potential suffering. On the other hand, they might be making assumptions about the future child's life quality and the challenges they might face. Autism is a spectrum, and experiences vary widely. The author is making a decision based on their son's specific challenges, which might not be representative of all autistic individuals.\n\nAlso, the author's wife sees this as selfish, which adds a relational dynamic. The author is making a personal choice, but it affects their partner's wishes as well. There's a balance between personal ethics and partnership. The author could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort or fear of future difficulties over their partner's desire for another child.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that having autism is inherently a negative thing. The author mentions the bullying and difficulties but doesn't consider the positive aspects or the possibility that the future child might have a different experience. It's possible the author is projecting their son's challenges onto a hypothetical future child without knowing the circumstances.\n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive choice. People have the right to decide whether to have children based on various factors. However, the line is crossed when the decision is based on ableist thinking\u2014that is, believing that a life with autism is not worth living or that autistic individuals are somehow less valuable. If the author's reasoning is rooted in the belief that having autism makes a life harder or less worth living, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author might also be misunderstanding the nature of autism. They mention that the specialist diagnosed the son as autistic without much process, and the author had a sense from the start. But autism is a neurodevelopmental difference, not a disease or something that \"needs to be fixed.\" The author's perspective might be influenced by societal stigma rather than an understanding of autism as a natural variation.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement about not wanting to \"roll those dice\" implies a risk they're not willing to take, but it's important to recognize that every child comes with uncertainties. The author is choosing to avoid a specific challenge but isn't accounting for other possibilities\u2014maybe the second child could have other difficulties or maybe they could have an easier life.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction is also a factor. If the author is dismissing their partner's desire for another child as selfish, that could indicate a lack of empathy in their decision-making process. It's a partnership, so considering both partners' desires and discussing openly is important.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the perspective. If the author's decision is based on a genuine desire to prevent suffering and they are making an informed choice, it's a personal decision. However, if the decision is rooted in ableism or the belief that autistic lives are not worth living, then it's more problematic. The line between personal choice and ethical responsibility is blurry here.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that the author is not being selfish but is instead trying to avoid future suffering. However, that reasoning can be a slippery slope where people decide what's best for others' lives, which is ethically questionable. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong, but their reasoning might reflect a lack of understanding about autism and the value of diverse lives.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the author's motivation (altruistic vs. selfish?), the assumptions made about future children's lives, the ethical implications of reproductive choices, and the impact on the relationship. The answer hinges on whether the decision is seen as a legitimate personal choice or as discriminatory.\n"
