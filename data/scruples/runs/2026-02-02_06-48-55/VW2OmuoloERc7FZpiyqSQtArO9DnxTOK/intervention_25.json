Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person doesn't want a second child because their first son has autism and various health issues. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation. The wife thinks they're being selfish, but the author feels the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a decision based on the potential suffering of a future child. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life for another child. However, autism is a neurodiverse condition, not a disability. People with autism have varying experiences; some may face challenges, but many lead fulfilling lives. The author's assumption that another child would have a similarly hard life might be an overgeneralization. \n\nAlso, the decision to have children is deeply personal. While the author cites their current child's struggles, they might be projecting without knowing how future circumstances could change\u2014like better support systems, advancements in treatment, or different manifestations of autism in another child. The author is essentially deciding based on their current child's experience, which might not be representative of all autistic individuals.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning could be seen as making a judgment about the value of life based on potential hardships. This might come off as ableist, implying that a life with disabilities is less worth living. The wife's perspective that the author is being selfish and spiteful could stem from the fact that the decision isn't just about their son but about a hypothetical future child. \n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge the author's valid concerns about the challenges they face with their current child. The stress, lack of sleep, and health issues are real and significant. But deciding against a second child based on those factors might not necessarily be the \"wrong\" choice\u2014it's a personal decision influenced by their experiences.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intent and fairness. The author's intent isn't malicious; they want to prevent potential suffering. However, their reasoning might not account for the variability in individual experiences and could perpetuate negative stereotypes about autism. The wife's reaction might be valid because the decision involves more than just their son's situation\u2014it's about making a choice that affects future possibilities and family dynamics.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reasoning could be seen as making a prejudiced judgment about potential future children based on their current child's specific circumstances, which isn't fair or accurate. But there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) because it's their personal choice and they're acting based on their current knowledge and stress. However, the AITA community tends to frown upon decisions that are perceived as making a judgment on the worth of others' lives, even if the intent is to protect.\n"
