Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a son with autism, who also has other challenges like sleep issues, eczema, allergies. He mentions that bringing another child could mean similar struggles. He loves his son but doesn't want to risk another child having a hard life. His wife disagrees, thinking he's being selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, deciding not to have another child is a personal choice. He's not forcing anyone; it's about his and his wife's family planning. He's not discriminating against people with autism but is considering the potential hardships. On the other hand, some might argue that it's selfish to not take the chance, or that autism isn't a hardship in the same way. Also, the author's view that autism is a burden could be seen as ableist, but he does express love for his son.\n\nI should check if the author's reasoning is valid. He's making a decision based on his family's current circumstances. The wife's perspective is also important, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The key is whether his reasoning is morally wrong. Since he's not harming anyone else, just making a personal choice, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, there's a nuance in how he views autism. If he's seeing it as a negative thing, that could be problematic. But he does mention loving his son, so it's possible he's considering the challenges without denigrating his son's worth.\n\nAlso, the term \"Autism\" is sometimes seen as a spectrum with varying experiences. The author might be making an assumption that another child would have similar or worse challenges, which isn't certain. But he's allowed to assess his own capacity to handle more children.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal decision based on his family's situation. Unless he's being discriminatory or harmful, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
