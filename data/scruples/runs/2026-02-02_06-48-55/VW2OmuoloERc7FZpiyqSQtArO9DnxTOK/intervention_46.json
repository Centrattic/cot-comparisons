Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife learned that their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. The son has significant challenges: sleep issues, physical conditions like eczema and allergies, and behavioral issues. The author admits they always wanted a second child but now feel it's too risky for another child to have a similarly hard life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and cruel, but the author believes they are being responsible.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might face similar or worse hardships. The wife disagrees. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder; not every autistic child will have the same level of difficulty. The author is assuming that future children would likely be autistic and have similar or worse conditions, possibly leading to a life of suffering. They're making a decision based on this perceived risk.\n\nBut here's the thing: autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that doesn't inherently make someone's life worse. Many autistic people live fulfilling lives with appropriate support. The author is projecting their son's specific challenges onto any future child, which might not be accurate. Also, genetics play a role in autism, but it's not a certainty. Even if a future child is autistic, their experience would be different, and they might have strengths the author hasn't considered.\n\nThe author's decision is based on fear of potential suffering. However, deciding not to have a child for this reason can be seen as making a judgment about the value of a life that could be autistic. This might be considered ableism, as it assumes that having autism equates to a life not worth living. The wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish, possibly because she values the possibility of another child's life and the family's expansion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their genuine concerns and feelings. They love their son but are overwhelmed by the current situation. It's important to consider that parenting a child with disabilities can be extremely challenging, and the author might feel they can't provide the same level of care for another child. However, this is a personal choice, and while it's valid for the author to have these feelings, others might see it as limiting opportunities for another child to have a good life.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a philosophical debate here. Some might argue that it's reasonable to consider the well-being of future children, while others might argue that making such a decision based on potential disabilities is discriminatory. The author's reasoning could be seen as a form of procreative responsibility, where they're trying to avoid what they perceive as a harmful situation. However, if the reasoning is based on ableist beliefs, then the author could be in the wrong.\n\nThe community's response to AITA posts often leans towards empathy. While the author's concerns are understandable, if the reasoning is rooted in devaluing a life with autism, that's problematic. The wife's reaction might be valid if she feels the author is making a judgment about autistic lives. However, the author is also dealing with real stress and challenges, so their decision isn't entirely without merit.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the author's reasoning is based on valid concerns about their ability to care for another child or on a flawed assumption that autistic lives are inherently less valuable. If it's the latter, they're in the wrong. If it's the former, it's more nuanced. Given the author's statement that they don't want another child to have a life as hard as their son's, it seems they're making a value judgment about that quality of life, which could be considered ableism. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
