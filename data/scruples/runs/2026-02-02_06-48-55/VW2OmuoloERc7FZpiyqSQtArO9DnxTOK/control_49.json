Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they have a son with autism and various other health issues, and they don't want to have a second child because they don't want another child to go through similar struggles. The wife thinks the author is selfish and an asshole for not wanting another child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is making a decision based on their son's condition, which is confirmed by a specialist. They mention the challenges they face, like sleep deprivation, medical issues, and the son's behavior. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a situation, even though their wife disagrees.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder. Some people with autism have significant challenges, while others lead independent lives. The author assumes that another child might also have similar issues and a hard life. But is that a fair assumption? There's a genetic component to autism, so there might be a higher chance if one child is autistic. However, each child is different. The author is choosing not to risk another child's potential hardships.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about preventing potential suffering. They love their son but are concerned about the quality of life. On the other hand, some might argue that life's challenges are inevitable and that having another child could also bring joy and support. The wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish, implying that they're prioritizing their own fears over the possibility of another child having a good life.\n\nEthically, this is a tough one. Decisions about having children are personal. The author is making a choice based on their current experiences and knowledge. However, it's possible that their fears are exaggerating the potential hardships of having another child. Also, the author's son is young, and with proper support, his quality of life could improve. Another child might provide sibling support and could have a different experience.\n\nIs it selfish to not want to take the risk? If someone chooses not to have more children because they can't handle the stress, that's a personal choice. But the author is framing it as a moral duty to prevent potential suffering, which could be seen as a valid perspective. However, others might argue that avoiding parenthood due to fear of challenges is avoiding responsibility rather than being selfish.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. They believe they're protecting a future child from hardship. But without knowing if another child would have similar issues, maybe that's a gamble either way. Also, they might not be considering the possibility of different outcomes or the support systems available.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex issue. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for making a decision based on their experiences and fears. However, their wife's reaction might stem from a different perspective on family and the value of having more children despite the challenges. The answer would depend on the ethical stance one takes on such decisions. Given that, the author might not be in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
