Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deciding not to have another child because their current son has autism. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author and their wife found out their young son has autism, and he has significant challenges\u2014sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and they're getting only 3-5 hours of sleep a night. The author feels it's wrong to bring another child into the world who might have similar or worse struggles. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is being selfish. The author is seeking validation on whether they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nNow, considering ethical and moral perspectives. The author's reasoning is based on not wanting to impose a difficult life on another child. They mention the child's current hardships and the potential for another child to face similar issues. On the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while the author's son has challenges, many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives with the right support. The decision to have another child is a personal one, but the author's reasoning could be seen as making a judgment about the quality of life for another potential person. Ethically, some might argue that the author is assuming they know what's best for a future child, which is a form of ableism. Others might support the author's decision as a responsible choice based on their current experience.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The term \"wrong\" implies a moral or ethical failure. The author is making a personal choice based on their circumstances and feelings. While some may criticize the reasoning as flawed (e.g., assuming another child would have the same issues, not accounting for support systems, etc.), the decision itself is a personal one. The author isn't doing harm by choosing not to have another child; they're making a choice that affects their own family planning. \n\nBut the author's justification might be problematic. The post includes a fear based on their son's current struggles and the potential for another child to have a similarly hard life. This could be seen as making a value judgment about people with autism, implying that their lives are not worth living. That's a form of ableism, which is ethically problematic. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the decision itself (since it's their choice), but the reasoning could be considered flawed or harmful.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If \"wrong\" refers to moral culpability, then there's a nuance. The author might not be acting maliciously but is making a decision based on personal experience. The community might view the author's reasoning as problematic because it devalues the lives of autistic individuals. On the other hand, others might support the decision as a responsible response to their specific challenging circumstances.\n\nIn terms of the AITA context, the user's wife is upset because she thinks the author is being selfish. The author believes they're making a responsible choice. The community often considers intentions and context. If the author's intention is to prevent future suffering, is that selfish? Or is it avoiding responsibility for potential future challenges? The answer might depend on cultural, ethical, or personal beliefs about disability and family planning.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal one, but the reasoning could be seen as ethically questionable. However, whether that makes them \"in the wrong\" depends on the perspective. If the question is about moral wrongdoing, there's an argument for A (they are in the wrong for ableist reasoning). If it's about the decision itself, maybe B (not wrong, as it's their choice). But in the AITA framework, the community often focuses on the perceived selfishness or harm. Given that the author's reasoning might be viewed as devaluing autistic lives, which is a form of ableism, the answer might lean towards A. However, the decision not to have a child is a personal choice, so there's a case for B as well.\n"
