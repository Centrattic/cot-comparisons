Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a young son who's been diagnosed with autism, and the father is now against having a second child because of the possibility that another child might also have autism and similar challenges. The wife thinks he's being selfish and spiteful, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The father's reasoning is based on the idea that bringing another child into a situation where they might have a difficult life due to autism and physical issues is selfish. He's concerned about the child's well-being and his own ability to handle another such child. On the other hand, the wife thinks he's being an asshole, which could be because he's making a decision that affects her without considering her perspective. \n\nNow, thinking about ethics and responsibility. Is it wrong to not want another child because of the risk of autism? Autism is a spectrum, and some people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The father might be making an assumption that another child would have the same level of difficulty as their first. But isn't it also valid for parents to consider their capacity to care for another child with special needs? If they already have significant challenges with one child, adding another could strain their resources and emotional capacity. \n\nBut then, should someone's decision about having more children be judged for their existing child's condition? The father is not choosing to avoid having children in general but is reacting to the specific circumstances. However, some might say that he's stigmatizing autism by viewing it as a burden, even if it's unintentional. The question is whether his reasoning is justified. \n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is important. If she still wants another child, then the father's unilateral decision could be seen as disregarding her wishes. But the father is prioritizing the potential future child's well-being. It's a tough balance between personal choice and the potential impact on others. \n\nI need to check if the author is making an unethical judgment. He loves his son but is worried about possible suffering for another child. But is that a valid reason? Maybe the risk isn't as high as he thinks. Autism can vary, and not every child would have the same issues. Also, parents often have to make tough decisions based on their current situation. \n\nHowever, the way he's phrasing it\u2014suggesting that it's better not to have another child because he might be \"badly afflicted\"\u2014could come off as implying that a life with autism is not worth living. That's a key point. If the father truly loves his son, even with the challenges, maybe his concern is more about the practical aspects of raising another child with similar needs. But is that selfish? It's a personal choice, but the assumption that another child would have the same issues is problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether his reasoning is based on a realistic assessment of risk and resources, or on a negative view of autism itself. If it's the former, then it's a responsible choice. If the latter, he's in the wrong. Since the father mentions his son's life is hard due to physical and behavioral issues, maybe he's more concerned about the practical challenges rather than the condition itself. But the way he frames it could be seen as seeing autism as a negative trait. \n\nIn the end, the father's decision is a personal one, but the judgment about not wanting another child because of the risk of autism might be influenced by stereotypes or lack of understanding about the condition. The wife might feel he's being unfair to their son and to her. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his reasoning could be seen as stigmatizing autism, even if his intentions are to protect a future child.\n"
