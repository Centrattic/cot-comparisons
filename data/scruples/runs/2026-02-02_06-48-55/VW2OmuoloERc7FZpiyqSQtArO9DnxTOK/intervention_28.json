Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent who found out their son has autism and is now considering not having a second child because they don't want another child to have a similarly difficult life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels they're making a responsible choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a decision based on the potential of their future child having autism or similar challenges. They mention the current child's struggles, including sleep issues, health problems, and autism. The author's concern is about the child's quality of life and the potential challenges the child might face, like bullying mentioned.\n\nBut is it ethical to decide not to have another child based on the possibility of genetic or environmental factors leading to similar issues? On one hand, the author is concerned about the well-being of the potential child, not wanting them to suffer. On the other hand, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about the future child's life and experiences. They might also be making a judgment about people with autism, which can be seen as ableist, implying that a life with autism is inherently less valuable or worth having.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that having a child with autism is a burden, which could be considered problematic because it devalues the lives of autistic individuals. However, the author is acting out of love and concern for the child's future. It's important to note that autism is a spectrum, and many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's perspective might be influenced by their current son's specific challenges, but that doesn't account for the diversity in experiences among autistic individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the decision to have children is personal and complex. While the author is considering the potential hardships, others might argue that parents should not base such decisions on the possibility of disability, as it's a form of discrimination. However, the author is not actively causing harm but rather choosing not to bring a child into a situation where they believe the child might face significant challenges.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the spouse's opinion. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, which introduces another layer of consideration about shared family decisions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong independently of the spouse's opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the ethical stance taken. If we consider that deciding not to have a child because they might have a disability is a form of ableism, then the author is in the wrong. However, if we take the perspective that parents have the right to make such personal decisions based on their circumstances and values, then the author is not in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether one views the decision as discriminatory or a personal choice made with good intentions despite potential flaws in reasoning.\n"
