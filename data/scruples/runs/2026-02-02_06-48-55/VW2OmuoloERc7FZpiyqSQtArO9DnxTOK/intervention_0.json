Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their son is autistic. The person wrote about the challenges they face with their son, like sleep issues, health problems, and the autism diagnosis. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life, but their wife disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on their son's condition, worried about another child facing similar struggles. But is that selfish? Or is it a reasonable concern for the child's well-being? Autistic individuals, like anyone else, can have fulfilling lives, even with challenges. The author's reasoning is that bringing a child with autism might subject them to a difficult life, but autism is a part of who they are, not inherently a curse. \n\nThen there's the aspect of reproductive rights and personal choice. The author is making a choice based on their circumstances. However, the decision might be influenced by ableist thinking, assuming that a life with autism is less valuable. The wife's reaction suggests she disagrees, which is important. Also, the author's son is happy and loved, but the author is projecting future challenges onto a hypothetical child. \n\nBut is it the author's place to decide the worth of life based on potential conditions? The author's intentions are to avoid causing suffering, but they might not know what a future child would experience. The decision could also be seen as overlooking the support and love they can provide. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be malicious, but their reasoning could be flawed by underestimating the value of life with autism and overestimating the negative aspects. The answer hinges on whether the decision is based on valid concerns or harmful stereotypes.\n"
