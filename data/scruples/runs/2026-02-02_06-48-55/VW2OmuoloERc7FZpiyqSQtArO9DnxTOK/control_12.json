Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child due to their first son's autism. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent has a son with autism, which comes with significant challenges: sleep issues, physical health problems, and the stress of parenting a child with special needs. The parent is questioning whether it's selfish to not want another child, fearing the new child might have similar or worse issues. The wife thinks the parent is being selfish, but they feel they're being responsible.\n\nKey points to consider: Autistic individuals have a right to exist and should not be seen as burdens. The parent's concerns are valid due to their current experiences. However, the decision to not have another child is personal. The parent isn't making a judgment on autism itself but is prioritizing their family's well-being. \n\nThere's a difference between acknowledging the challenges and viewing autism negatively. The parent loves their son but is considering the potential hardships. It's about family capacity and resources. The wife's perspective might be that they should try regardless, but the parent feels overwhelmed. \n\nIs it wrong to make a choice based on personal and family circumstances? The parent isn't harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. They're being honest about their limits. However, society sometimes expects people to \"try\" regardless, which can be unrealistic. The parent's intention is to avoid potential suffering, but it's a personal choice. \n\nAlso, autism is a spectrum. The next child might not have the same level of challenges. The parent is making a decision based on their current experience but can't predict the future. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the parent isn't being malicious. They love their child and are considering their own capacity. The wife's reaction might stem from different priorities. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (no, the author isn't in the wrong). They're making a personal decision based on their unique circumstances and challenges, and it's not inherently selfish to prioritize their family's well-being.\n"
