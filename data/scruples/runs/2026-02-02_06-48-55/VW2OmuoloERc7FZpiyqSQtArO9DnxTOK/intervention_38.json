Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son is autistic and they're worried the next child might have similar issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife found out their son has autism, and he's also dealing with health issues like eczema and allergies. The author is saying that because of the challenges they're facing, he doesn't want another child who might have similar problems. His wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels he's being responsible.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's decision is wrong. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and while it comes with challenges, it's part of the autism spectrum, which varies widely in how individuals experience it. The author's reasoning is based on the idea that having another child with autism would mean a difficult life for the child and for the family. But is it ethical to decide not to have a child based on the possibility they might have a condition like autism?\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. The author is making a choice based on his perception of potential suffering. But autism itself isn't a disease to be cured; it's a part of who the person is. Many autistic individuals and their advocates argue that autism, while it can present challenges, is also a valid way of being. The author's decision might be seen as ableist, implying that autistic lives are not worth living, which is a harmful assumption.\n\nAlso, the author is projecting his experiences onto a future child. His son has autism along with other health issues, but those might not necessarily be linked. Eczema and allergies are separate from autism. The author is conflating them, which might not be accurate. So, the decision is based on a specific combination of factors that may not apply to a future child.\n\nAnother angle is reproductive autonomy. The author has the right to make decisions about having children, but the question is whether the reasoning is justified. By saying it's selfish to bring a child into a difficult life, he's making a value judgment that others might not agree with. However, others might see his stance as a responsible choice given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, which shows there's a conflict in their values. The wife might believe that it's wrong to avoid having a child due to potential disabilities, while the author believes it's avoiding unnecessary suffering. Both perspectives are valid to some extent, but societal views are shifting towards acceptance and support for people with disabilities.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a complex issue. If the decision is based on the belief that autistic lives are inherently harder and thus not worth pursuing, that's problematic. However, if it's about the family's ability to cope and provide adequate care, that's a different matter. The author mentions their current child has significant needs, so the stress on the family is real. But deciding against a future child based on potential genetics is a personal choice, though it might reflect a lack of understanding about autism.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is discriminatory. If he's assuming that any child with autism would have a worse life, he's in the wrong. If he's being realistic about the family's capacity to handle another child's needs, it's a more nuanced situation. However, given the way he frames it\u2014avoiding bringing a child into potential hardship due to autism\u2014it leans towards being in the wrong because it devalues the lives of autistic individuals.\n"
