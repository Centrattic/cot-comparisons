Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because of their first son's autism. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's son was diagnosed with autism. They mention that the son also has eczema, allergies, and sleep issues. The author is worried that a second child might have similar or worse challenges. The wife wants another child, but the author is against it, thinking it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. The author feels they're not selfish, but their wife disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nLet me consider different angles. From a rights perspective, everyone has the right to have children, but the decision is a personal one. The author is making a choice based on their experiences and the potential suffering. But is it wrong to consider the child's quality of life? The author is concerned about the child's well-being, which is a valid point. However, assuming that a future child would have the same challenges is speculative. Autism is a spectrum, and while there's a genetic component, it's not guaranteed another child would be autistic. Also, the author's view that autism is a \"bad\" condition might be influenced by their current stress and challenges. It's possible they're projecting their current difficulties onto a future child without considering that the next child might have a different experience or that societal support has improved.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are understandable. Caring for a child with autism can be demanding, and the sleep deprivation and health issues mentioned are significant. The decision to have another child is a big responsibility, and considering the child's potential quality of life is a factor. But is it wrong to base that decision on the possibility of the child being autistic? That's the crux here.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that a child with autism has a harder life. Some people with autism lead happy, fulfilling lives, and the author might be making a judgment based on their own experiences or societal stigma. The author's wife might see the situation differently, valuing the potential joy a second child could bring despite the challenges.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's current stress affecting their judgment. When parents are exhausted and under a lot of pressure, their decisions can be clouded. The author might be reacting to the immediate stress of their son's condition rather than a long-term, well-considered decision.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it selfish to not want to have a child if there's a risk of the child having a disability? Some might argue that it's a personal choice and not the author's place to decide the worth of a potential life with autism. Others might say that the author is acting in the best interest of the future child, trying to prevent them from suffering. However, this is a complex ethical issue without a clear right or wrong answer, but more about personal values.\n\nLooking at the author's reasoning, they acknowledge loving their son but feel it's wrong to bring another child into a potentially difficult life. They compare it to other kids they knew with autism who were bullied. This could indicate a fear of societal challenges rather than the autism itself. The author's stance could be seen as ableist if they're assuming that a life with autism is less valuable, which might make their reasoning problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author is making a personal decision based on their current challenges and assumptions about a potential future child's life. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their reasoning is considered selfish or a valid concern. If the decision is based on a belief that a child with autism has a lesser quality of life, that could be seen as wrong. However, if they're considering their current capacity to provide adequate care and support, it's a more complex situation. The key here is the assumption that the next child would have a similarly hard life, which isn't necessarily true. Therefore, the author's reasoning might be flawed, making them the asshole.\n"
