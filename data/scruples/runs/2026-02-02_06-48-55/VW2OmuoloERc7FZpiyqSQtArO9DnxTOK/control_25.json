Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism and various other challenges. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author states they don't want another child if there's a chance they might have similar or worse issues. They're concerned about the child's quality of life and potential bullying. But is it selfish? Well, every parent makes decisions based on their family's capacity and what they believe is best for the child.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while the first child has multiple challenges, having autism isn't necessarily a negative. Many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The author's reasoning assumes that another child would automatically have the same issues, which isn't guaranteed. However, the decision is personal and about the parent's ability to manage their resources and energy.\n\nThe wife thinks the author is being selfish. But the author's stance is about wanting to avoid potential suffering, which some might see as protective. Others might argue that not wanting to take the risk is selfish. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Ethically, it's a matter of personal belief. The author isn't making a decision that harms anyone else; they're choosing based on their family's circumstances. So, the answer hinges on whether prioritizing the well-being of existing children and the family's capacity is considered selfish or a responsible choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is a personal one, and while others may disagree, it's their right to choose based on their values and family situation.\n"
