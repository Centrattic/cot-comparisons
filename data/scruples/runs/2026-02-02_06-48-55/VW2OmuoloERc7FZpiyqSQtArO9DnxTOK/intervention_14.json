Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because of their autistic son's challenges. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their young son has autism, which they weren't surprised by. The son has significant physical and behavioral challenges, like sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the parents are getting very little sleep. The author feels that bringing another child into the world, who might have similar or worse conditions, is selfish and doesn't want to subject another child to such a life. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful. The author is seeking validation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's reasoning. They are worried about the potential quality of life for another child and the challenges they've experienced with their first. The question is whether this reasoning is valid or if the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child based on their son's autism.\n\nAutism is a spectrum, so each child's experience can vary widely. Just because one child has autism doesn't mean another will have the same level of difficulty. The author is making an assumption that a second child would have a similarly hard life, which might not be accurate. However, the author is making a personal choice based on their current experiences and the desire to avoid potential suffering for another child and their family. \n\nOn the other hand, the argument against the author is that it's not their place to decide another child's worth of life. Everyone has different challenges, and even with autism, many people lead fulfilling lives. The author might be projecting their current struggles onto a hypothetical future child without considering that circumstances could be different, or that the child could have a different experience. Additionally, the author's decision is based on a fear of future hardship, which is a personal choice, but others might argue that life's challenges are inevitable and that it's not ethical to make such a decision based on a neurodivergent condition.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of parents. Parents often make decisions based on their ability to care for a child. If the author feels that they cannot provide the necessary care for another child with similar needs, that's a personal consideration. However, autism doesn't automatically mean the child will have the same physical and behavioral issues. The author's son has additional health issues (eczema, allergies), which might be separate from autism. The author is conflating autism with all the difficulties their son is facing, which might not be fair.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say the author is being selfish because they are denying a potential child the chance to exist, even with challenges, and assuming they know what's best for that hypothetical person. Others might argue that parents have the right to make decisions based on their circumstances and well-being.\n\nThe author also mentions seeing other kids with autism in school who were bullied. That's a societal issue (bullying) rather than an inherent aspect of autism. Addressing societal attitudes is different from deciding against having another child based on that. \n\nIn the context of AITA, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are justified and if they are being unreasonable. The author's decision is a personal one, but the way they frame it as not wanting to \"roll the dice\" might be seen as making a judgment about the value of a potential life with autism. That could be viewed as the \"asshole\" perspective because it's making a decision for another person's life. However, others might empathize with the author's situation, given the hardships they're currently facing.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether one believes the author is being selfish and making a judgment about another person's life (ITA) or if they are making a reasonable decision based on their personal circumstances (not the asshole). The author is not wrong in feeling overwhelmed, but their reasoning about another potential child's worth based on their son's experience could be seen as problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A, but this is a nuanced topic with valid arguments on both sides.\n"
