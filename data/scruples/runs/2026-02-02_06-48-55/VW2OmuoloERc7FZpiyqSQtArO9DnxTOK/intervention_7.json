Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they have an autistic son with various challenges, and they don't want to have another child because they're worried the next child might also have autism or similar issues. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into a hard life, but the wife disagrees.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's reasoning is based on not wanting to subject another child to a life of hardship. But is it their place to decide the value of another person's life? Autistic individuals, like anyone else, can lead fulfilling lives, even with challenges. The author is making a judgment about potential future suffering, which is a complex issue. \n\nAlso, the decision to have children is personal. The author is making a choice based on their current experiences and fears. However, they might not be considering that autism is part of neurodiversity and that many people with autism contribute positively to society. They might also not realize that their child's experience isn't the same as others'\u2014some autistic people might not view their life as worse and find ways to thrive.\n\nThe author's wife sees them as selfish, which suggests a conflict in values. The author's stance could be seen as ableism, assuming that a life with autism is inherently worse. It's possible they're projecting their own challenges onto a potential future child without considering that circumstances could be different or that support systems can improve quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a personal choice about their family planning. It's their right to decide how many children they have, but the question is whether their reasoning is wrong. The line between making a personal decision and holding a harmful belief is thin here. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author is justifying their decision based on the perceived quality of life for a potential child. That can be seen as ethically problematic because it devalues lives with disabilities. However, the decision itself, while based on problematic reasoning, is a personal choice. The community might judge the reasoning as wrong, hence the AITA aspect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their reasoning implies that autistic lives are less valuable, which is a form of ableism. Even if their decision is personal, the underlying attitude is ethically questionable.\n"
