Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they found out their young son has autism and they're deciding not to have another child because they don't want another child to go through similar challenges. The wife disagrees, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention the son's autism, plus other issues like sleep problems, eczema, allergies. The author feels that bringing another child might inherit similar or worse conditions, and they don't want that for another child. They also mention witnessing bullying of autistic kids in school, so they're worried about that for another child. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author feels it's the opposite.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on their experience with their current child. They have real concerns about the quality of life for another child and the family's ability to handle it. Choosing not to have another child is a personal decision, and people have the right to make such choices based on their circumstances and values. The author isn't making a discriminatory statement against autistic people; they're concerned about their child's potential future.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see it as selfish because the author is prioritizing their own fears over the possibility of having another child. Also, autism is a spectrum, and each child is different. The author might be making assumptions about another child's life based on their son's specific challenges. However, the author's intention is to protect a future child from hardship, which isn't inherently selfish. They are considering the child's well-being rather than just their own convenience.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author loves their son and isn't dismissing his condition but is using his experience to inform their decision. They're not saying autism is bad, just that they don't want another child to face similar struggles. So, in terms of moral responsibility, they might not be in the wrong for making a difficult choice based on their family's circumstances. The answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
