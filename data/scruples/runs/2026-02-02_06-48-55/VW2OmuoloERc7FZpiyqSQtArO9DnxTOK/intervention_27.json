Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their son has autism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author and his wife have a young son with autism, along with other health issues like eczema and allergies. They were considering a second child but the father now feels it's selfish to have another child who might have similar challenges. The wife is upset with him for being selfish and spiteful, while the father believes he's making a responsible choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father's reasoning is valid. The key points here are his decision to not have another child due to the potential for the next child to have autism or similar difficulties. I need to consider different perspectives. \n\nFrom the father's viewpoint, he's concerned about the child's well-being, considering the existing challenges. He's worried about the child's quality of life, the possibility of bullying, and the strain on the family. He might feel that bringing another child into such a situation isn't fair to them. But from the wife's perspective, maybe she still believes in growing the family despite the challenges, or she might feel that the father is unfairly stigmatizing autism or not considering the positives of having another child. \n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder. The current child's experience is severe with sleep issues, physical health problems, and the father's intuition about the signs. However, autism varies widely in presentation and impact. Not all autistic individuals have the same challenges. The father's assumption that another child would have \"as bad or worse\" might be an overgeneralization. Also, the idea that it's selfish is debatable. Parents often consider the future well-being of their children when making family planning decisions. \n\nBut is it wrong to decide against a second child based on this? Some people might argue that life's challenges aren't a reason to avoid having more children, especially since every child is unique. Others might say that the father is being realistic and protecting his family from additional strain. The wife's reaction could be that the father is using the first child's autism as a reason to be cruel to the possibility of another child, whereas the father is trying to avoid potential suffering. \n\nI should also think about the ethical aspect. Parents have the right to make decisions about their family size, but does that include making assumptions about future children's health and abilities? The father is not being malicious but is making a choice based on his current experiences. It's possible that he's projecting his son's specific challenges onto a new child without considering that each child is different. \n\nAdditionally, the father's comments about kids he went to school with being bullied might indicate a misunderstanding of autism or a negative view of the condition. However, he does express love for his son, so it's not necessarily a negative view but a concern about quality of life. \n\nThe user mentioned they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if there's merit to his concerns. If the father's decision is based on genuine concern for the well-being of future children, it might be seen as a responsible choice. However, if he's making a decision based on fear or societal stigma, that's a different matter. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his decision is selfish or a legitimate concern. The term \"selfish\" is subjective here. The father is prioritizing the potential child's future over his own and the family's ability to cope. It's a tough call. \n\nIn summary, the father is not in the wrong if he's making an informed, compassionate decision considering the child's well-being. However, there's a risk in stereotyping or overestimating the likelihood of a second child having similar issues. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that parents can have these considerations, the answer might be B (No). But I need to be careful not to ignore the wife's feelings and the potential for the father's reasoning to be influenced by negative biases. However, the father's deep love for his son adds nuance, suggesting he's not being malicious. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
