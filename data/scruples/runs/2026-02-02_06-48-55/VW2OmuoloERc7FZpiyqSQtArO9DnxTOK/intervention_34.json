Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting another child due to autism. The situation is that their son has autism and various health issues, and the father is concerned that another child might have similar challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The father's decision is based on his perception of the child's suffering. He's worried about bringing another child into a life that might be hard. But is it okay to make a decision based on someone else's potential traits?\n\nAutism is a spectrum. Some people with autism live fulfilling lives. The father might be generalizing based on his son's specific challenges. Also, he mentions that the son is a \"handful,\" but that's part of their unique needs, not necessarily a negative aspect for the child himself.\n\nThe wife thinks he's being selfish. Is he? If he's choosing not to have another child to avoid potential hardship, but that means denying another child the chance at a life, even a challenging one, is that selfish? Or is it a personal choice about family planning?\n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive rights and personal responsibility. People have the right to make decisions about their family size based on their circumstances. However, there's a counterargument that disability doesn't equate to a life not worth living.\n\nThe father's feelings are valid, but does his reasoning cross into ableism? By implying that a life with autism is worse, he might be perpetuating negative stereotypes. Each person's experience with autism is different, and some might not see it as a hardship in the same way.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She might feel the decision is based on fear rather than an actual understanding of autism. Communication between the couple is key here, as this is a shared decision.\n\nIn summary, the father's decision is personal, but the reasoning could be problematic if it's based on the assumption that a life with autism is inherently less valuable. However, considering the practical challenges they face, his hesitation is understandable. The line between personal choice and ableism is thin here.\n"
