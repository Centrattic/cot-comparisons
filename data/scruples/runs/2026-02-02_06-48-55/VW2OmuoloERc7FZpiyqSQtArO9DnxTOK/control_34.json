Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's being selfish by not wanting another child because his first son has autism and other issues.\n\nFirst, the user is dealing with a lot of stress. Their son has autism, severe eczema, allergies, and sleep problems. They're getting only 3-5 hours of sleep a night. That's a huge burden. The author feels that bringing another child into the world might mean similar suffering, so they don't want another child. His wife disagrees, saying he's being selfish.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The author is making a personal decision based on his current situation. He loves his son but is worried about the potential for another child to have similar challenges. The wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels it's not selfish. \n\nAutism is a spectrum, and while his son has it, another child might not have the same level of challenges. However, the author is making a choice based on the risks. Is it selfish to not want to take that risk? Or is it a responsible decision to consider the well-being of future children?\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. On the other hand, some might argue that giving another child a chance is better than assuming they'd have a hard life. But the author isn't saying they'd have a worse life, just that they might have similar challenges.\n\nThe author isn't judging people with autism or wanting to prevent others from having autistic children. He's just making a personal choice for his family. His wife might feel he's being negative, but his reasoning is about the potential quality of life and his ability to manage another child under the current stress.\n\nSo, considering that, the author's stance is about family capacity and responsibility rather than discrimination against people with autism. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. The question is whether he's the asshole. The subreddit usually looks at intent and context. Since his intent is to protect future children, and he's not being discriminatory, the answer is likely B.\n"
