Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent deciding not to have a second child because their first child has autism and other health issues. The parent feels it's selfish to bring another child into a potentially difficult life, but their wife disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parent loves their son but is concerned about the challenges autism and other conditions present. They mention lack of sleep, health issues, and the potential for bullying. The parent's decision is based on not wanting another child to face similar hardships. The wife thinks the parent is being selfish.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal rights. The parent is making a decision based on their assessment of their child's well-being and their own capacity to care for another child. Is it wrong to prioritize not bringing a child into a difficult situation? Some might argue that it's a responsible decision to avoid potential suffering. Others might see it as making a judgment about a person's worth based on their characteristics, which could be considered ableist.\n\nAutism is a part of a person's identity for many. The parent's fear of the child facing bullying or challenges isn't the parent's fault, but deciding against having another child based on the possibility of autism might be seen as a personal choice. However, if the decision is based on the belief that a life with autism is worse, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the parent's wife is upset, which adds a relational aspect. The parent is making a decision that affects the family's future, which requires mutual agreement. The parent might be acting in their own conscience, but it's a sensitive topic.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers intentions. The parent's intention is to prevent potential suffering, but it's a complex issue. Whether the parent is wrong depends on the perspective. Some might say it's a valid choice, others might think it's discriminatory. Since the question is about being an asshole, if the parent is making a reasonable decision based on their circumstances, they might not be the asshole. But if the reasoning is dismissive of the value of autistic lives, then they might be considered the asshole.\n\nI think the answer is A (in the wrong) because the decision could be seen as making a judgment about the quality of life for a potential child based on their characteristics, which is a form of ableism. However, I'm not entirely sure. The parent's intention is to avoid suffering, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
