Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they have a son with autism and various other health issues, and they don't want to have another child because they don't want another child to have a hard life like their son. Their wife is upset with them for being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's reasoning is that bringing a child into the world with potential suffering is selfish. But is that a valid reason? Some people argue that it's not ethical to bring a child into existence if you anticipate significant suffering, but others might say that every life has value regardless of challenges. \n\nThe author mentions the child's autism, sleep issues, allergies, and eczema. They love their son but are concerned about another child facing similar or worse difficulties. However, autism is a spectrum, and not all autistic individuals have the same level of challenges. Also, the author's son might have other issues that aren't autism-related, which complicates the reasoning.\n\nThe wife thinks the author is being selfish. Maybe she feels that the decision is based on fear or a lack of acceptance of the first child's challenges. The author could be projecting their fears onto a future child without considering that the next child might have a different experience\u2014maybe even a better quality of life with proper support.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is making a personal choice about family planning. People have the right to decide how many children they have, but the reasoning here is based on the potential suffering of a future child. Ethically, some might argue that it's not the parents' place to decide another person's worth based on potential challenges. Others might agree that the parent is acting in the best interest of future children.\n\nI should also consider societal views. There's a debate about eugenics when decisions are made based on perceived genetic risks. The author isn't testing for autism but is using their current child's condition as a reason to avoid another child. This could be seen as making a decision based on fear of recurrence, which might not be entirely rational.\n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, they are concerned about their ability to provide for another child given their current situation. They mention sleep deprivation and health issues, which could affect their capacity to care for another child effectively. However, the decision is framed around the potential child's well-being rather than their own capacity.\n\nThe author's love for their son is clear, so it's not that they dislike autistic individuals. It's more about not wanting another child to face similar hardships. But is it fair to assume that another child would have the same issues? Autism is genetic but not deterministic. Also, the author's son's other health issues (eczema, allergies) might be separate from autism.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: personal choice in family planning, ethical considerations of potential suffering, the validity of the author's fears, and the impact on the wife's feelings. The answer depends on whether the reasoning is considered selfish or a legitimate concern for the child's well-being.\n"
