Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking for a judgment on whether the person who posted this is an asshole (AITA) for deciding not to have another child after their first child is diagnosed with autism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife have a young son with autism, multiple health issues, and behavioral challenges. The son is getting about 3-5 hours of sleep per night, which is really tough. The author feels that bringing another child into the world might mean another child with similar struggles. They love their son but don't want to risk another child having a hard life. The wife thinks the author is being selfish and spiteful, but the author believes they're making a responsible decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider different perspectives. On one hand, making the decision not to have another child is a personal choice. People have the right to decide their family size based on their circumstances. The author is concerned about the well-being of a potential child, trying to avoid putting them through similar hardships. This could be seen as a compassionate decision, prioritizing the future child's quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about the future child's life. Autism is a spectrum, and while there are challenges, many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author might be underestimating the potential for their future child to have a good life, especially with support. Also, the decision to not have another child could be based on fear and the current stress of raising their first son, which might cloud judgment.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility to their current child. The post mentions that the son has significant needs, and adding another child might increase the family's stress. However, this is a personal decision, and the author is considering their capacity to provide adequate care. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point to consider. She might feel that the author is dismissing their previous desire for a second child and that this decision is based on fear rather than a genuine assessment of their ability to handle more children. The author's wife might feel that they should support each other through challenges rather than making a decision that could lead to resentment.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to decide not to have more children. There's no law that compels someone to have a second child. However, the emotional aspect is complex. The author might be overgeneralizing, thinking that any future child would have autism or similar issues, which isn't necessarily the case. Autism is not hereditary in most cases; it's more influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. So, the risk for another child isn't extremely high just because the first one has autism.\n\nThe post also mentions that the author is not surprised by the autism diagnosis, suggesting they recognized the signs. This might indicate they are aware of the challenges and are making an informed decision. However, it's important to note that every child is unique. Even if another child had autism, their experience could be different, and with appropriate support, they could thrive.\n\nIn terms of selfishness, the author is prioritizing the potential future child's well-being over the desire for a larger family. However, some might view this as a form of selfishness because they're not taking the risk of having another child. Others might see it as a responsible choice to avoid putting another child through challenges they can't manage.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's mental health and stress levels. If the current situation is extremely taxing, adding another child could be overwhelming. The author's decision might be a way to protect their own mental health and the family's overall well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is personal and they have the right to make it, the question is whether it's morally wrong. Since the decision is based on personal beliefs and concerns for a future child's well-being, it's a complex ethical issue. However, making such a choice is a personal matter, and unless it's based on harmful or discriminatory reasons, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a difficult decision based on their current understanding and experiences.\n"
