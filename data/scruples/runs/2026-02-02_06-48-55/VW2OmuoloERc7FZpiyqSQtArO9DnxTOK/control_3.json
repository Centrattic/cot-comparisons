Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have another child because their first son has autism. The question is a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario, so we need to analyze the situation from different angles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their son has autism and other medical issues like eczema and allergies, leading to significant sleep deprivation and stress. They love their son deeply but are concerned about bringing another child into the world who might face similar challenges. The wife feels the author is being selfish, but the author sees their decision as responsible.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. Autonomy is a big part of reproductive rights. Parents have the right to decide how many children to have based on their circumstances. The author's decision is personal and based on their current life situation. It's not about the child's worth but about the family's ability to cope. \n\nHowever, there's also the ethical angle of not wanting a child to suffer. The author is worried about the potential for another child to have a hard life, which seems compassionate. But others might argue that it's impossible to predict future quality of life and that people with autism can lead fulfilling lives with support. \n\nThe author isn't saying autism is bad, but they're making a choice based on their experience. They acknowledge loving their son and the challenges they face. The wife's perspective is important too, but the question is about the author's rightness. \n\nSociety often stigmatizes disability, so the author's fear might stem from that. But personal choice in family planning is generally respected. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, the decision isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision is a personal choice based on their circumstances. They aren't being malicious; they're prioritizing their family's well-being. Therefore, the answer would be that they are not the asshole.\n"
