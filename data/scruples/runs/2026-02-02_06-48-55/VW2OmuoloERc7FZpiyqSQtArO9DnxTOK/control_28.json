Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a son with autism and other health issues, and the father doesn't want another child because he doesn't want another child to go through similar struggles. His wife thinks he's being selfish, but he feels like it's the right decision. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The father is concerned about the quality of life for another child if they might inherit similar conditions. He mentions sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and autism. He's worried about bringing a child into a difficult situation, which he sees as selfish. The wife thinks he's being an asshole, but he thinks he's being responsible.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, making a decision based on not wanting to subject another child to hardship might be seen as a protective measure. He's not making a judgment about autistic people but about the potential suffering. On the other hand, is it up to him to decide what kind of life is worth living for another person? Also, is it possible that his perspective is influenced by societal stigma or his own challenges?\n\nAutism is a spectrum, and many autistic people lead fulfilling lives. The father might be projecting his own struggles onto a future child. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling that he's dismissing the value of their son's life or being overly cautious. \n\nEthically, is it acceptable to choose not to have another child based on the possibility of similar conditions? People have various reasons for family planning, including health and lifestyle. However, the father's reasoning includes a judgment about the quality of life, which might be seen as a form of ableism if he's devaluing the lives of people with disabilities.\n\nBut then again, he's making a personal choice for his family. The line between personal ethics and societal judgment is blurry here. The father's intention is to avoid potential suffering, but others might argue that he's making an assumption about his future child's experience. Also, considering the existing child's needs, maybe they're not equipped to handle another child, which is a practical concern.\n\nIn terms of the community's typical response to these kinds of \"Am I the Asshole?\" questions, they often emphasize empathy and consideration for others' feelings. The father's wife feels disrespected, which could indicate that his communication was hurtful. However, the core issue is his decision-making process.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the father's reasons are based on his experiences, but they might also reflect a lack of understanding of the potential for a positive life with autism. His decision isn't inherently wrong, but the way he expresses it (calling it selfish when he's the one choosing not to have more children) might be problematic. The answer would depend on whether the decision is considered ethically sound despite the wife's feelings. If the focus is on the decision itself, it's more about personal choice. If it's about the way he's treating his wife's feelings and the potential for ableism, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The question asks if he's in the wrong, not about the wife's reaction. The main issue is his reasoning. If the community typically responds that prioritizing not having another child due to disability is selfish or wrong, then answer A. If they see it as a personal choice, then B. In similar scenarios, people often argue both sides. However, the way he's framing it as bringing another person into a hard life could be seen as devaluing that life, hence A. Alternatively, it's his choice as a parent, hence B. I think the answer is A because he's making a judgment about the quality of life based on his own perspective, which might not consider the child's potential experience. Also, the wife's feelings are important here. So, the answer would be A.\n"
