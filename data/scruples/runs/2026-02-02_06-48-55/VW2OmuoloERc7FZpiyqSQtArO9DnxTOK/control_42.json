Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a parent who, after receiving an autism diagnosis for their son, has decided against having another child due to concerns about the potential hardships another child might face. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author justifies it as not wanting to bring a child into a difficult situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on their child's challenges. They love their son but are worried about the quality of life for a future child. Is it selfish to not want to have another child because of these concerns? People have different views on what's ethical here. Some might say that it's selfish to avoid having a child due to potential hardships, while others might see it as responsible planning. \n\nThe author mentions the child's autism, sleep issues, health problems. They don't want another child to face similar or worse difficulties. The wife sees it as selfish, but the author feels it's the opposite. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for making this decision. \n\nI should also consider societal perspectives. In some cultures, having children is seen as a duty, but others respect personal choice. The author's reasoning is based on their experience and love for their existing son. They don't want another child to suffer. However, others might argue that life's challenges are inevitable and that it's not up to parents to decide if someone else's life is worth living. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the spouse's opinion. The wife thinks the author is being an asshole, which adds tension. But the author is acting on their conscience. The question is whether their reasoning is valid. \n\nAnother angle: the author is making an assumption that another child would have similar or worse conditions. Autism is a spectrum, and each case is different. The author might be overestimating the likelihood of another child having the same issues. But they are making a choice based on their current knowledge and experiences. \n\nIs it ethical to make decisions about future children based on existing ones' conditions? Some might argue that it's a personal choice, and others might see it as eugenic thinking. However, the author isn't making a decision to terminate a pregnancy but rather choosing not to have another child. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is considering the well-being of a potential child. They are trying to avoid subjecting another child to potential suffering. However, some might counter that all children face uncertainties, and it's impossible to guarantee a better life. \n\nThe author's perspective is rooted in their personal experience and love for their son. They are prioritizing the potential child's quality of life. But others might argue that it's presumptuous to decide that a life with autism is inherently worse. \n\nI need to weigh these points. The answer isn't black and white. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If being in the wrong means acting selfishly or unethically, then opinions might differ. But since the author is making a personal decision based on their conscience and circumstances, it's a matter of personal ethics. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a choice they believe is in the best interest of a potential future child, even if others disagree.\n"
