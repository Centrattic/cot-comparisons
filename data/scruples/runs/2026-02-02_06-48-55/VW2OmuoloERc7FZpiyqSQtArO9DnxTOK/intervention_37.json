Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father found out his son has autism and other health issues. He and his wife wanted a second child, but he changed his mind. He feels it's selfish to bring another child into the world who might have similar challenges. His wife disagrees, calling him selfish. The question is whether his stance is wrong.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder. Having one child with autism doesn't necessarily mean another child will have it, though there might be a higher risk depending on family history and other factors. The father is making a decision based on his assessment of potential hardships. He's concerned about the child's quality of life, considering the challenges his son faces. But does that make him selfish?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory to decide against having a child with potential disabilities. The father's reasoning is that he doesn't want the child to suffer, but others might say it's wrong to decide someone else's worth of life.\n\nThe father mentions his son's specific issues: sleep problems, health conditions, and autism. He's concerned about the burden on the family and the child's well-being. But is it fair to assume another child would have the same issues? Autism is variable, and not all autistic individuals have the same level of support needs. Plus, with proper support, many autistic people live fulfilling lives.\n\nThe father's wife is upset, saying he's being spiteful. That's a conflict in their relationship. However, his intentions are to protect a future child from hardship. Is that a valid reason, or is he making a judgment about the value of life if the child has autism?\n\nIn some cultures, disability is seen as a natural part of human diversity, and parents might choose to have more children regardless of the challenges. Others might prioritize the family's well-being. It's a personal decision. The key here is whether the decision is based on valid concerns or prejudice.\n\nThe father is not wrong for prioritizing his family's ability to cope, but some might see his stance as ableism\u2014assuming that a life with autism is less worth living. That's a crucial point. If he's making a judgment about the quality of life for someone with autism, that's problematic. However, if he's simply considering the family's capacity to provide care and support, it's a practical decision.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the decision is based on the child's potential condition being undesirable or on the family's practical limitations. If it's the former, he's in the wrong. If the latter, it's a personal choice. The story doesn't clarify, but his statements about not wanting another child with similar hardships lean towards ableism. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
