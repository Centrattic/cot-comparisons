Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a second child because their first son has autism and other health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention that their son has autism, which was confirmed by a specialist. They also note the challenges of caring for him, like sleep deprivation, physical issues, and the risk of the next child having similar or worse problems. The author feels it's selfish to bring another child into such a difficult situation. The wife disagrees, calling the author selfish and spiteful.\n\nSo the key points here are the author's perspective on responsibility, their concern for the child's well-being, and the wife's perspective on family planning. The question is whether the author is wrong for their stance.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder, and while it can come with challenges, many people with autism lead fulfilling lives. The author is basing their decision on their son's specific difficulties, which include autism plus other health issues. However, autism itself isn't inherently a \"hard life\"\u2014support and understanding can make a big difference. The author is conflating autism with the other issues (eczema, allergies, sleep problems), which might not necessarily be linked. They might be overestimating the likelihood of another child having similar issues, especially since autism is not solely genetic and can vary widely.\n\nThe author's argument hinges on the idea that bringing a child into a life of potential suffering is selfish. But this is ethically complex. Decisions about having children involve personal values and circumstances. The author is making a choice based on their current experience, which is valid, but others might argue that it's unfair to assume another child would have the same issues. Also, considering that autism is part of human diversity, some might see the author's view as discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their capacity to handle another child's needs. They're not making light of the challenges. The wife's reaction (\"selfish and spiteful\") might be more about the emotional impact of the decision rather than the reasoning itself. The author isn't choosing to avoid responsibility for their current child but are considering future possibilities.\n\nIn ethical terms, this is about autonomy and personal choice. The author isn't harming anyone by deciding not to have another child. However, the perception of being an \"asshole\" might come from societal expectations around family size or differing views on disability. The author's stance might be seen as wrong if it's based on a misunderstanding of autism as a negative condition. If they view autism as a disability that diminishes quality of life, that could be considered a form of ableism. But if they're concerned about the specific challenges their son faces (which include more than autism), their decision is a personal choice about family planning.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the decision is based on a fear of autism itself, that could be problematic. But if it's about the specific combination of health issues and the practical challenges they face, it's a personal decision. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with a range of outcomes, and the author is conflating it with other issues, their reasoning might not be entirely sound. But the decision to have a child is ultimately personal. The answer might be nuanced, but the prompt asks for A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author is making a choice based on their circumstances, even if others disagree, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if the reasoning is rooted in ableism, then they might be in the wrong. But the author does express love for their son, suggesting they aren't malicious. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
