Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to have a second child because their first son has autism. The author mentions their son's challenges: autism, sleep issues, eczema, allergies, and the potential for bullying. They feel bringing another child into a similar situation would be selfish. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, but the author believes they're making a responsible choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on their current experiences. Autism itself isn't a bad thing, but the family's situation is extremely challenging. The author's reasoning is that they don't want another child to suffer similar hardships. But is it wrong to consider the potential suffering of a future child?\n\nOn one hand, the decision is about family planning and personal circumstances. Parents have the right to consider their quality of life and ability to care for children. The author is prioritizing their son's well-being and their own capacity to provide care. On the other hand, not wanting another child because of a genetic risk might be seen as discriminatory or not accepting disability. Also, autism is a neurodiverse trait, not a disease, and many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives.\n\nBut the author is worried about the child's potential hardships, like bullying and health issues. They might not be accounting for future advancements in treatment or the child's own ability to thrive despite challenges. However, the author's concerns are genuine and based on their current struggles. The wife's reaction suggests a conflict in values: the author sees it as responsible, while she sees it as selfish.\n\nI should also consider if the author is overestimating the likelihood of the next child having autism. Autism can have various causes; just because one child has it doesn't mean another will. The author is making an assumption that might not be accurate. But given their experience, they're making the best decision they can with the information they have.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to not want another child due to these factors? It's a personal choice, but the author's reasoning might come off as negative towards having children with disabilities. However, they love their current son and are trying to protect future children from similar struggles. There's a balance between accepting potential risks and ensuring a quality upbringing.\n\nThe answer isn't clear-cut. The author's intentions are to prevent suffering, but their perspective might not fully respect neurodiversity. However, the decision is ultimately theirs, and they're not harming anyone by choosing not to have another child. So, maybe they're not in the wrong, but their reasoning could use more nuance.\n"
