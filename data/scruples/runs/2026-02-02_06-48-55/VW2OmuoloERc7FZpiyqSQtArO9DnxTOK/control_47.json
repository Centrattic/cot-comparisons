Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey have a son who was just diagnosed with Autism, even though it's typically diagnosed at 4. The specialist confirmed it right away. The father isn't surprised and feels he saw it coming. The son has multiple challenges: sleep issues (only 3-5 hours of sleep for the parents each night), needs to sleep with them, eczema all over, allergies. He's described as a \"handful,\" which is an understatement. The father loves his son deeply but doesn't want another child because he doesn't want another child to go through similar hardships. The wife wants a second child, but the father thinks it's selfish to risk bringing another child who might have a hard life. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for this decision.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, let me consider the arguments for each side. \n\nFrom the father's perspective: He's making a decision based on his current experiences. He loves his son but acknowledges the challenges. He might feel that bringing another child into such a difficult situation is cruel. He's concerned about the child's potential to have similar issues and not wanting to impose that on another life. He could be viewing it as a responsible choice to avoid future suffering.\n\nFrom the other side (his wife's perspective): The father might be making assumptions about the second child. Autism isn't hereditary in a predictable way; having one autistic child doesn't guarantee another will be. Also, some might argue that the father is being selfish by not wanting to take the risk, and that parents should be willing to care for any child regardless of challenges. The wife thinks he's being an asshole, which suggests she sees his stance as selfish or not considering the possibility of a different outcome for the second child.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. On one hand, parents have the right to make decisions based on their family's circumstances. On the other, some might argue that deciding not to have more children based on the possibility of another child having a disability is a form of ableism\u2014assuming that a life with disabilities is inherently worse. The father might be projecting his own challenges onto a potential future child without considering that the child could have a fulfilling life despite difficulties, or that the parents could adapt better with support.\n\nAlso, the father's statement about not wanting to \"roll the dice\" implies he's making a probabilistic judgment, but the reality is that autism isn't a guaranteed outcome. He might be overestimating the likelihood of another child having similar issues. Additionally, the father's focus on potential suffering could be seen as not valuing the potential joys and unique qualities of another child, even if they have different challenges.\n\nAnother angle is that the decision is between two parents, and the wife is in favor. The father's refusal to have another child despite his wife's wishes could be seen as dismissive of her desires, potentially causing conflict. However, if the father is firm in his beliefs, it's a matter of personal choice versus spousal compromise.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might support the father's caution, while others might criticize him for making assumptions about the second child's life quality. The key here is whether the father's reasoning is valid. If he's making a decision based on his current hardships and wants to avoid future ones, that's his prerogative. However, if he's devaluing the worth of a life with autism, that's problematic.\n\nLooking at the original question: Is the author in the wrong? The father expresses concern about the child's potential hardships, not because the first child's life is not valuable, but because he doesn't want another to have the same struggles. But he does love his son. The line here is whether his reasoning is based on genuine concern for the child's well-being, or if it's an underlying belief that a life with autism is not worth living. If it's the former, he's making a personal choice. If the latter, it's discriminatory.\n\nThe answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal decision based on his family's circumstances. However, others might argue that he's making assumptions about the second child's life quality, which could be considered ableist. But without more context on his intentions, it's hard. The key is whether his reasoning is based on valid concerns or prejudice. The father does express love for his son, so it's possible he's trying to protect future children from similar challenges, which is a reasonable parental instinct. However, his dismissal of the possibility that another child could be different or that they could manage better might be the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision influenced by current experiences, but there's a counterargument for A. However, given the options, the more likely answer is B.\n"
