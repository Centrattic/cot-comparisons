Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting a second child due to their son's autism. The author is saying that because their first child has autism and various health issues, they don't want to bring another child into a potentially similar difficult situation. The wife thinks the author is being selfish, hence the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's reasoning is based on the desire to prevent potential suffering in a future child. They mention the challenges they face with their current son, including sleep deprivation, medical issues, and autism. They feel it's selfish to bring another child into such a hard life. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks the author is being selfish, which suggests there's a conflict in their priorities. The author is making a decision based on their current experiences, but others might argue that predicting the future child's experience is speculative. Autism is a spectrum; the next child might have a different experience entirely. Also, the author's concerns about bullying might not be universal, as their son's experience with autism could vary.\n\nThere's a philosophical angle here about the ethics of procreation. Some people believe that bringing a child into a difficult situation is morally wrong if there's a risk of suffering, while others argue that parents can't predict the future and that every life has value. The author's stance is that they don't want to \"roll the dice\" again, but others might say that deciding not to have another child based on the possibility of autism isn't necessarily selfish\u2014it's a personal choice based on their circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of ableism to consider. The author seems to be viewing autism as inherently negative, which is a controversial stance. Many in the autism community advocate for acceptance and see autism as a natural variation rather than a disease. The author's statement that they don't want a child who could have a life as hard as their son's implies that having autism equates to a worse quality of life, which isn't universally accepted.\n\nAnother point is the author's responsibility to their current son. They're focused on the potential future child's well-being, but they might not be addressing the current support their son needs. Choosing not to have another child doesn't alleviate the existing challenges but might shift the focus away from supporting the first child adequately.\n\nIn terms of the question of being in the wrong, the key factors are the author's reasoning and the impact of their decision. If the author's decision is based on a fear of potential suffering and not on any malice or harm towards their current son, then it's a personal choice. However, if the author's views are influenced by incorrect assumptions about autism (like equating it with a lower quality of life without evidence), that could be problematic. The community might argue that the author is in the wrong for making such a consequential decision based on assumptions, but others might see it as a responsible choice given their current struggles.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author is expressing a valid concern about their family's well-being and capacity to handle more challenges. However, their framing of autism as a negative might overlook the positive aspects and the possibility that the next child could have a different experience. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is selfish or a reasonable decision under the circumstances.\n"
