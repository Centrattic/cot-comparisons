      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering not having a child because there's a 50% chance the child (if a boy) could develop Retina Pigmentosa, leading to blindness in their 20s. They mention not wanting their child to suffer as their father did, who ended up blind and without a job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author's concern is about not wanting to impose a severe condition on their child that would limit their life. But is that a valid reason to not have a child?\n\nI remember that there's a concept called \"procreative responsibility,\" which involves considering the well-being of the potential child. If the condition leads to significant suffering, some argue that bringing a child into the world with such a condition could be harmful. However, others might say that individuals have the right to reproduce regardless of potential genetic risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being discriminatory; they're making a personal choice based on their values and the child's future. But is it wrong to decide not to have a child for this reason? Some people might see it as selfish or a refusal to accept challenges, while others might respect the decision to avoid potential suffering.\n\nAlso, the author clarifies that they aren't being offensive to those with disabilities. They're making a choice based on the specific medical implications here. It's important to note that the condition is gender-specific and has a known probability, which the author is using to make an informed decision.\n\nI should also consider the autonomy of the individuals involved. The author and their spouse have the right to make reproductive choices. However, if the wife is affected and the condition is hereditary, ethical considerations might involve her rights as well. But the question here is about the author's stance.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a range of views. Some cultures might support the decision to avoid passing on a debilitating condition, especially if it's preventable through other means like adoption or in vitro fertilization with selection. Others might argue that it's not up to the parents to decide what kind of life is worth living.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"not wanting to deprive a child of joys.\" The author is prioritizing the child's potential quality of life over the desire to have biological children. This is a personal choice, and unless there's coercion or harm involved, it's generally considered their right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision is based on a desire to prevent future suffering for their child. While some might argue that it's a form of ableism to avoid having a child with disabilities, the specific condition here is severe and leads to blindness, which significantly impacts life. The author isn't judging people with disabilities but is making a choice based on the child's potential future. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
