      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in their 20s. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife has a family condition that affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning whether it's wrong to not want to have a child who might face such a life-altering condition. They mention not wanting their child to miss out on life's joys, citing the wife's father as an example who's blind, unemployed, and socially isolated. The author clarifies they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities and made a throwaway account to avoid their wife seeing it.\n\nNow, considering ethical viewpoints. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their beliefs and values. The author is concerned about the potential suffering of their child, which is a valid parental concern. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child because of a potential disability, especially when the child might lead a fulfilling life despite challenges.\n\nI should also consider the medical aspect. RP is a genetic condition; if it's X-linked recessive, the inheritance pattern matters. If the wife is a carrier, her sons have a 50% chance of inheriting it. But the author's decision is based on the potential outcome, not the certainty. The question is whether avoiding parenthood due to this risk is morally wrong.\n\nThere's also the perspective of disability rights. Some people with disabilities might argue that society should not equate their condition with a life without value. However, the author is focused on the child's quality of life, not the disability itself. They mention not wanting to \"deprive\" the child, which could imply a belief that a life with RP is lesser. But the author also states they don't intend to offend, so it's a nuanced position.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's no universal answer. Some would support the author's decision as a personal choice, while others might see it as avoiding responsibility or underestimating the child's potential. The key is whether the decision is made with empathy and understanding, which the author seems to express.\n\nI should also think about the implications. Choosing not to have children due to genetic risks raises broader questions about eugenics versus reproductive rights. The author isn't making a judgment about people with RP but about the risks they're willing to take as parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on individual moral compasss. The author is making a personal choice based on their assessment of potential future suffering. Whether that's \"wrong\" is subjective, but from a reproductive rights standpoint, they are within their rights to decide not to have children if they believe it would cause significant suffering.\n"
