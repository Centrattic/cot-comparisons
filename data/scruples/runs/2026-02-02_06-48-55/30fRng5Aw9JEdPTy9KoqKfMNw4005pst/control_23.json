      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (an \"asshole\") for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, leading to blindness in their 20s. The husband and wife are discussing having kids, and the wife has a family history of this condition affecting men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind. The husband is concerned about the child's quality of life and doesn't want them to suffer a life like the husband's father, who is blind and has no job or social life. The question is whether the husband is wrong for feeling this way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The husband is expressing a desire to avoid putting a child through a potentially harsh life due to a genetic condition. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their beliefs about quality of life. On the other hand, some might argue that it's prejudiced to decide not to have a child based on potential disabilities, which could be seen as ableism.\n\nThe husband clarifies that he's not trying to offend people with disabilities. He's concerned about the child's future experiences, like not seeing their kids grow up or having independence. However, others might counter that even if there are challenges, the child could lead a fulfilling life with support, and it's not for parents to decide that life isn't worth living. Also, the father's father's life (no job, no social life) might not be the only possible outcome with modern medical advancements or support systems.\n\nThe husband is using a throwaway account because his wife is online, which might suggest he's anxious about her reaction. The wife's perspective isn't fully presented here, so we don't know if she's in favor of having children despite the risk. The husband's stance is about preventing unnecessary suffering, but it's a personal choice, and many people would respect that. However, some might argue that it's unethical to make such a decision without knowing the child's perspective.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a spectrum. Some believe it's acceptable to avoid passing on a hereditary disease if possible, especially if it has severe implications. Others might see it as a form of discrimination. The key here is that the husband is not making a judgment about people with disabilities but about the potential hardships his child might face. The condition's severity (blindness in 20s leading to loss of independence) could justify his concern.\n\nThe husband isn't being disrespectful to his wife's family; he's acknowledging the condition's impact. He's making a personal choice based on his values. Unless there's pressure on the wife or disregard for her wishes, his stance is a personal reproductive decision. Since the post is about his own feelings and not forcing the wife's hand, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (he's not the asshole).\n"
