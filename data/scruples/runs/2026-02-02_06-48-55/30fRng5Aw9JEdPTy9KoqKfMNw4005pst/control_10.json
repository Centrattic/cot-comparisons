      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's wrong for the person not to want a child who might develop a condition (Retinitis pigmentosa) leading to blindness in their 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a man whose wife has a family history of this condition. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is concerned about subjecting a child to such a life, citing examples like the wife's father who is blind, has no job or social life, etc. He's asking if not wanting to have a child in this scenario makes him the asshole. He also clarifies that he's not trying to be offensive to people with disabilities and used a throwaway because his wife might be reading it.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values, health, and future considerations. Genetic conditions that could severely impact a child's quality of life are a valid concern. Parents often consider potential hardships when making family planning decisions. The author isn't discriminating against someone who already has the condition but is trying to prevent a child from being born with a condition that could lead to significant life challenges. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not for parents to decide what life is worth living. Others might view this as eugenic thinking, which has a problematic history. However, the author is making a personal choice, not enforcing a societal standard. Also, the author is not opposing having children if the child is a girl, which is a genetic factor here. The condition affects males in the family, so it's a specific risk. The author's concern is about the potential suffering the child might face, which is a legitimate parental worry.\n\nThe author also clarifies that they are not being offensive. They are reflecting on the possible life outcomes. The wife's father's situation is presented as an example of the potential challenges. So, the author is weighing the risks and making a decision based on possible future scenarios.\n\nIn the context of AITA, the community often looks at whether the person acted with malicious intent or was unreasonable. The author's reasoning seems based on concern for the child's well-being, even if it's speculative. The fact that they're using a throwaway because the wife might be reading it suggests they're aware of the sensitivity but still have their reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is making a personal choice based on their assessment of what's best for a potential child. Unless there's a proven malicious intent or a violation of rights, it's more about personal ethics. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because individuals have the right to make such decisions without being labeled as assholes.\n"
