      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether it's wrong not to want to have a child who might go blind in their 20s due to a family condition. The author is a man, and his wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the family. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he might lose his sight. The author is worried about his child missing out on life's joys, like the grandfather who ended up without a job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Retinitis Pigmentosa is. It's a genetic disorder causing progressive vision loss, leading to blindness. It's usually inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, so if the mother is a carrier (and the father isn't affected), sons have a 50% chance of getting it. Daughters have a 50% chance of being carriers. So the author's concern is valid in terms of the genetic risk.\n\nNow, the author is saying he doesn't want to subject his child to such a life. The key here is the ethical aspect of procreation when there's a risk of a serious genetic condition. There's a debate in ethics about this. Some people argue that parents have a duty to avoid bringing children into the world with severe, preventable suffering. Others might say that it's not up to parents to decide who is \"worthy\" of life, regardless of their potential challenges.\n\nThe author also mentions he's not trying to offend or be patronizing. He's concerned about the quality of life for his child. The grandfather's situation is cited as an example of what he wants to avoid. However, it's important to note that people with RP might adapt and live fulfilling lives. The grandfather's lack of job or social life might be due to personal choices, societal factors, or the progression of the disease, not inherent to the condition itself.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"procreative responsibility.\" The author is making a personal choice based on his values and what he believes is best for his future child. It's a deeply personal decision, and others might have different perspectives. Some might argue that it's selfish to not take the risk, while others might support the decision to avoid potential suffering.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is subjective, based on social judgment. In the context of the original post (AITA), the community often considers factors like intent, harm caused, and whether the person is being unreasonable. The author isn't being cruel or discriminatory; he's expressing a valid concern about his future child's well-being. He's also clear that this isn't about mocking people with disabilities.\n\nHowever, there's a risk in making decisions based on assumptions about the child's future quality of life. The child might lead a happy, meaningful life despite the condition. The author's decision could be seen as a responsible use of reproductive autonomy, or as a refusal to embrace potential challenges. But in terms of being in the wrong, unless there's coercion or harm to others, it's a personal choice.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). He's making a personal decision based on his values and the information he has, without malice. People with disabilities might have differing views, but the act of choosing not to have a child with a known risk isn't inherently wrong unless it's done with harmful intent.\n"
