      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men and can lead to blindness in their 20s. The husband is concerned about possibly having a son who would go blind and not want to subject him to that life. He's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might face such a challenging life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical angles here. The husband is worried about his child's quality of life. He's considering not having children because of the risk of passing on a genetic disorder that could severely impact the child's life. The key points here are the husband's intentions, the genetic risk, and the ethical considerations of bringing a child into the world with a potential disability.\n\nThe husband isn't dismissing people with disabilities; he acknowledges that he's not trying to offend. He's focused on the specific risks related to this condition and the potential hardships. From a utilitarian perspective, he might believe that avoiding pain and suffering is the right choice. However, others might argue that it's not for parents to decide someone else's worth based on potential challenges, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives.\n\nGenetic counseling could be a factor here. If the couple is aware of the 50% risk for a male child, they might consider options like in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to select embryos without the condition. But the post doesn't mention exploring these options, which might be a consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is making a personal choice about his family planning. Unless there's a legal or moral obligation to have children despite the risks, his decision is a personal one. The question is whether his reasoning is flawed. If he's making an informed decision based on a serious medical condition and considering the child's future, many might agree it's reasonable. However, some might argue that assuming the child would have a worse life without sight is a problem, as people with RP can adapt and find happiness.\n\nThe husband also mentions not wanting to deprive the child of \"joys,\" like his wife's father who is blind and has a limited life. But that example might not be representative of all individuals with RP. Some might have fulfilling careers and social lives, even with the condition. The husband's perspective is based on a specific family experience, but it's possible he's generalizing.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term is colloquial and often refers to someone being inconsiderate or cruel. The husband's post shows concern for his child's well-being and a desire to avoid suffering. If he's not being discriminatory but rather making a tough choice based on medical facts, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's making assumptions about the quality of life for someone with RP without considering their potential for adaptation, there could be criticism.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's reasoning is valid. Since he's making a personal choice regarding family planning, considering the risks, and not expressing prejudice, the answer might lean towards \"not the asshole.\" But some might argue that he's underestimating the resilience and possibilities for a fulfilling life despite RP. However, given the context provided and the husband's intentions, the more likely answer is that he's not in the wrong.\n"
