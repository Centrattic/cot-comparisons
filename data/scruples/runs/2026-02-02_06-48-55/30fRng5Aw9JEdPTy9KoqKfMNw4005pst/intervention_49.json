      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is considering not having a child because of a genetic condition that affects the father's side, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in the child's late 20s if they're a boy. The author is worried about the child's quality of life and not wanting them to miss out on things like their grandfather did. They also mention not wanting the child to be deprived of joys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspective here. The author is making a decision based on the potential hardships their child might face. On one hand, they're thinking of the child's future well-being, which is a common reason parents consider various factors before having kids. On the other hand, is it right to not have a child simply because of a potential disability? \n\nI remember that in some ethical discussions, the idea of \"preventing suffering\" is a valid reason for not having children with certain conditions. However, there's also the argument that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and that the parents' decision might be based on their own biases or fears rather than the child's actual experience. \n\nThe author mentions that their father-in-law has the condition and is blind, but that doesn't mean the child would have the same exact life trajectory. Each person's experience with a disability is unique. The author is also acknowledging that they're not trying to be offensive, which is a positive step. \n\nBut is it the author's right to make such a decision? In many ethical systems, parents have the right to make decisions based on their values and what they believe is best for their child. However, some people might argue that the author is making assumptions about the child's life quality based on their own perspective, not the child's. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about depriving the child of joys could be seen as prioritizing their own values over the child's potential autonomy. If the child were to have the condition, they might still find their own joys and adapt to their life. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is making a decision based on genuine concern for the child's well-being versus fear or societal expectations. Since they're trying to avoid potential suffering, it's a bit of a gray area. However, many would argue that parents can make such decisions based on their best judgment, even if it's not a definitive choice. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that life with a disability isn't as bleak as the author imagines, and by not having a child, they might be denying the child the chance to live a fulfilling life that they themselves can't imagine. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author isn't being malicious; they're expressing their feelings and concerns honestly. The wife might have different views, so there's room for discussion and compromise. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal decision based on their values and concerns for the child's future, even if others might disagree. The decision is personal and not malicious.\n"
