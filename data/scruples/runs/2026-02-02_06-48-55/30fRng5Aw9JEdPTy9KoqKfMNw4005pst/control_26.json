      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness by age 20, especially if the child is male.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is considering having a child but is concerned because the wife has a family history of a genetic condition that affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is worried about the child's quality of life and not wanting to subject them to a life where they might lose their vision, referencing the wife's father who is blind and hasn't had a job or social life. The author clarifies they don't mean to offend people with disabilities and created a throwaway account because their wife is online.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, making a decision based on potential genetic risks is a personal choice. Parents often consider various factors when deciding to have children, including health risks. The author is trying to prevent their child from suffering, which is a common motive. The author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is concerned about the child's future quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, where the author is devaluing the life of someone with a disability. However, the author explicitly states they don't intend to offend and are focused on preventing their child from experiencing hardship, not belittling those with disabilities.\n\nIn similar cases, the AITA subreddit often considers intent and context. The author isn't showing malice but is expressing personal boundaries. They're trying to make a responsible decision to avoid a scenario they find difficult. The key here is that the author isn't making a judgment about the worth of people with disabilities but is considering their own parenting choices based on potential outcomes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's concern is about the child's well-being and their own capacity to provide a good life. Unless there's a clear ethical violation or harm to others, personal decisions about family planning are generally seen as personal choices. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
