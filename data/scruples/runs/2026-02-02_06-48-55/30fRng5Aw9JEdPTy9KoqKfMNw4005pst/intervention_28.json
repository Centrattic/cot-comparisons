      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) that affects males. The husband is concerned because if they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his 20s, leading to a life without a job, social life, etc., similar to the wife's father. He's questioning if he's being an asshole by not wanting to put his child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genetic aspect. RP is a genetic disorder causing progressive vision loss. The question is about the inheritance pattern. If it's X-linked recessive, which it often is, then a female carrier can pass the gene to her sons. If the wife is a carrier, each son has a 50% chance of having RP. Daughters might be carriers or not, depending on the father's status. Since the husband isn't affected, if the condition is X-linked, the wife must be a carrier. So their sons have a 50% chance.\n\nNow, the husband's concern is about the potential quality of life for their son. He doesn't want to \"deprive\" the child of the joys life has to offer. The question is whether this makes him the asshole. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the husband is expressing a concern about his child's future, which is a valid parental instinct. Parents often worry about their children's well-being and try to plan for the best possible future. If they have the option to avoid passing on a genetic condition, especially one with significant life impacts, it's understandable to be cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, deciding not to have a child because of a genetic risk could be seen as making a choice based on potential disability, which some might argue is discriminatory. However, the husband isn't choosing a child with disabilities as a preference, but rather trying to avoid a condition that has severe consequences. The key here is intent. The user mentions that the post isn't meant to patronize or hurt people with disabilities, so it's not from a place of prejudice against them, but rather fear of the child's future quality of life.\n\nAlso, the wife's side of the story isn't presented. She might have her own perspective on this. But the question is about the husband's stance. The husband's right to have concerns about his child's future isn't inherently wrong, but it's important to consider the couple's communication and mutual agreement. Decisions about having children are deeply personal and involve weighing various factors, including health risks.\n\nIn ethical discussions, the idea of \"procreative responsibility\" comes into play. Parents have a duty to consider the well-being of their potential children, which includes avoiding serious harm if possible. However, it's also a matter of personal autonomy and the right to make reproductive choices. The husband isn't dismissing the value of a life affected by RP but is concerned about the associated hardships. There's no right or wrong here universally, but the question is whether his concern makes him the asshole. \n\nSince he's not making a judgment against the disabled but is considering the long-term impact on their child's life, it's a matter of personal values. Some people might argue that it's selfish to avoid having a child due to such concerns, while others might support his decision as a way to prevent suffering. The term \"asshole\" in these contexts often relates to selfishness or not considering others' feelings. The husband is not being malicious, but his fear might be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over the possibility of parenthood. However, the key point is that he's making a choice based on his understanding and the potential for significant life challenges, which is a common consideration in family planning.\n\nThe answer would depend on societal views on disability and reproductive choices. In many cases, people with disabilities lead fulfilling lives, so avoiding a child due to a risk of disability might be considered ethically questionable. But the husband isn't looking down on people with disabilities; he's looking at the potential hardships. So, is it the wrong to have that concern? The user thinks so, but others might not. The \"AITA\" context often considers the emotional aspect and whether the person is being unreasonable. If the wife is willing to take the risk and the husband is not, that's their personal decision, but the husband's stance could be seen as prioritizing his own fears over their mutual desire for children. The answer here is probably B (No), as the husband is expressing a legitimate concern based on potential suffering, even if it's a difficult choice.\n"
