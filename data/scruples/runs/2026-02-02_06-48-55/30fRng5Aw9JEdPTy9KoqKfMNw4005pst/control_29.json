      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might go blind due to a genetic condition. The author's wife has a family history of Retina Pigmentosa, which primarily affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind by his late 20s. The author is questioning if it's selfish to avoid having a child to prevent this outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. Retina Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited disorders leading to vision loss. If it's X-linked, since the wife is the carrier, her sons have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene. So the author's concern is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThe author is expressing concern about the quality of life for a potential child. They mention the grandfather's experience\u2014no job, no social life, etc. The author is worried about depriving the child of life's joys. But they also clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nNow, the ethical part. Is it wrong to choose not to have a child to avoid a genetic condition? There's a debate here. On one hand, some argue that life is worth living even with disabilities, and parents should support their children regardless. On the other hand, others believe it's responsible to avoid knowingly putting a child in a difficult situation.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the value of life but is considering the potential hardships. They're not making a judgment on people with RP but are focused on their own ability and willingness to provide a good life for their child. The key point is autonomy in reproductive choices. People have the right to decide whether to have children based on genetic risks, especially when there's no cure.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making a decision based on fear or a certain standard of living, which could be seen as ableist. But the author is also careful to state they don't mean to offend. The main issue is whether the decision is a personal one. Since there's no obligation to have children, the author isn't in the wrong for making this choice based on their circumstances and values.\n"
