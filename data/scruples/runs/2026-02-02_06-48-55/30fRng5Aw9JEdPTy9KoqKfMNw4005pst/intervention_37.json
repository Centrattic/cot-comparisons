      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition causing blindness by age 20. The author's wife has a family history of Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life and doesn't want to subject them to a future without vision, referencing the grandfather's struggles. He clarifies he's not being offensive and created a throwaway because his wife is online.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. So, I need to evaluate whether his stance is justified. First, consider the ethical aspects of procreation with genetic risks. The author is making a decision based on the potential suffering of the child. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to avoid unnecessary harm. On the other, life with disabilities can have meaning, and the author's fear of blindness might not account for the individual's resilience or future medical advances.\n\nThe author argues it's to prevent deprivation of life's joys, but is it his place to decide that for the child? Some argue that life, even with disabilities, can be fulfilling. However, the author isn't dismissing the child's worth but is prioritizing their well-being. The grandfather's example shows possible hardships, but it's a specific case. Also, the author isn't judging people with disabilities but is making a personal choice about parenthood. \n\nThe key points: Is it ethical to have a child with a 50% chance of a severe condition? The author's intention is to protect the child, not to be discriminatory. While the decision might seem harsh, it's a personal choice based on their values. Others might argue that the child could still lead a happy life, but the author is acting in good faith. The answer hinges on the balance between preventing suffering and the right to life. In many ethical frameworks, causing certain suffering is avoided, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, if there's a possibility of a positive life, some might see the author as making a selfish decision. But given the high risk and potential for a life without vision, the decision could be seen as protective rather than selfish. So, the author is likely not the asshole, making the answer B.\n"
