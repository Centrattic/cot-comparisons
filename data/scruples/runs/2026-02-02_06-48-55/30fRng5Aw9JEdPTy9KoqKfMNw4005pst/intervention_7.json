      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might go blind. The condition is Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. The author is worried about the child's quality of life if he's a boy and might go blind in his 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the condition. Retinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder causing progressive vision loss. It's hereditary, and the user's wife's family has it affecting males. So if they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could develop it. The author is concerned about the child's future and the potential hardships. They mention examples like the grandfather who is blind, jobless, and has no social life. They don't want their child to experience that. They clarify they're not trying to offend anyone but are conflicted about having a child.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning. They are making a personal choice based on potential future suffering. But is it ethical to decide not to have a child based on a genetic risk? Some might argue that it's a personal choice and they have the right to make decisions about their family. Others might say that it's discriminatory or eugenic. However, the author isn't trying to avoid disability per se but is considering the quality of life. They also mention that the condition is only in males, so they could choose to have a daughter, but that's not their decision here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author isn't causing the condition; they're trying to avoid passing it on. They're not making a choice against a child who already exists but are considering whether to have a child with a 50% chance of a life-altering condition. The choice to have children is a personal one, and parents often consider various factors that could affect their child's life. However, some might argue that it's not their place to decide what kind of life is worth living. But the author is also not dismissing the value of people with disabilities; they just don't want their child to go through that. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the decision is seen as selfish or reasonable. Since the author is making a personal choice based on their values and the potential hardships, it's likely not the wrong. The key is that they're not making a choice for an existing person but considering future possibilities. So, probably the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
