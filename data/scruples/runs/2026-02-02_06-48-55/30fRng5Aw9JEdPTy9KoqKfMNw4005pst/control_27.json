      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person is considering having a child but is worried about their son potentially developing Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in his late 20s. The author is questioning whether it's wrong to not want a child who might face such a challenge. They mention their father-in-law's experience, who is blind and has a poor quality of life, and they don't want their child to go through that. They also clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future suffering for the child. But is it their right to decide not to have a child based on genetic risks? There's the argument about autonomy\u2014parents have the right to make decisions for their future children, but some might say it's selfish to bring a child into the world with a known disability. However, others might argue that it's responsible to avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nThen there's the aspect of disability rights. Some people believe that disabilities don't inherently reduce quality of life and that it's wrong to make such judgments. The author says they don't want to deprive the child of \"joys,\" but this is subjective. People with disabilities often lead fulfilling lives, so assuming a lower quality of life might be a misconception.\n\nThe author's concern about their father-in-law's situation is noted, but individual experiences vary. Just because one person had a hard time doesn't mean all individuals with RP would. Also, medical advancements might improve outcomes in the future.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is being an \"asshole.\" The term implies a lack of empathy or consideration. The author is expressing personal feelings without intending to offend, but they are making a choice that others might view as discriminatory. However, their intent is to avoid potential suffering, which is a common parental concern.\n\nIn legal terms, there's no wrong here. The decision to have children is personal. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author isn't violating any laws, but societal views may differ. The key is whether the author's reasoning is valid. They are weighing potential future harm against the benefits of parenthood. Many parents make similar decisions based on genetic risks, like avoiding passing on serious hereditary diseases.\n\nThe author also mentions they are not trying to hurt anyone and acknowledge the complexity of disability. This shows some level of consideration. They are not making a judgment on people with disabilities but are considering their son's potential future. Their stance isn't about devaluing people with disabilities but about personal circumstances and quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize the author's decision as lacking empathy, others would support it as a responsible choice. Since the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which typically relates to legal or moral wrongdoing, the answer leans towards B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they are making a personal, informed decision based on their values and the potential impact on their child's life.\n"
