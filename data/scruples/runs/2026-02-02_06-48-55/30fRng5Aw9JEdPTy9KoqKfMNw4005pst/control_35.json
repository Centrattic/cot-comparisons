      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might go blind due to a genetic condition. The author's wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if they're being an asshole by not wanting their child to experience such a life, referencing the wife's father's difficulties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice about having children based on potential future health issues. People have the right to make decisions about starting a family, especially when considering the well-being of potential children. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, which is a valid consideration.\n\nNext, the condition in question is a genetic disorder with a known probability. The author is aware of the risks and is making an informed decision. It's not about discrimination against people with disabilities but rather a precaution to avoid passing on a serious condition. The author also clarifies that they aren't trying to offend anyone with disabilities, which shows they're considering the feelings of others.\n\nThe wife's father's situation is mentioned as an example of the challenges faced. The author is trying to avoid their child facing similar hardships. This is a personal and emotional decision, and it's within their rights to choose not to have children if they believe it might lead to significant suffering for the child. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's not their place to decide the life of a potential child, that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and that such conditions shouldn't be a barrier to having children. But the key point here is the author's intention to prevent harm, which is a common consideration in family planning. \n\nSince there's no indication that the author is being discriminatory or making a decision that harms others (other than a hypothetical future child, which is speculative), their stance seems morally defensible. The answer should be B (No) because the author is making a personal choice based on their assessment of the child's well-being and their own circumstances.\n"
