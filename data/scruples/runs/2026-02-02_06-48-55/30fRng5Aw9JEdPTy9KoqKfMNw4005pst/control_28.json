      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's wrong for someone to not want to have a child who might inherit a genetic condition leading to blindness later in life. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person's wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The author is saying they don't want their child to live through that, citing examples like the father's experience where he lost his vision and couldn't work or have a social life. They're asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to put a child through that.\n\nNow, considering ethics and personal choice. Having children is a big decision, and people have different reasons for choosing to have or not have kids. In this case, the author is concerned about the potential suffering their child might face. They're not judging people with disabilities but are focused on the quality of life for their child. \n\nGenetic conditions can be complex. RP is a real condition that leads to progressive vision loss. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could inherit it. The author is weighing the risks and considering the impact on the child's life. They're not opposing the idea of having a child with disabilities in general but are specifically concerned about the inherited condition here.\n\nIt's important to respect individual choices. People have the right to decide what's best for their family. Some might argue that the author is being overly cautious or making a decision based on fear, while others might see it as responsible planning. Also, there's the aspect of medical advancements\u2014maybe future treatments could mitigate RP. But the author is considering the current reality.\n\nThere's also the angle of not wanting to \"deprive\" a child of experiences. It's about wanting the best for their child. However, some might say that people with RP can lead fulfilling lives, and it's not fair to assume a bleak future. But the author's examples (father losing sight, no job, etc.) suggest they've seen the consequences firsthand.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, informed decision-making, and the ethical responsibility towards potential children. The author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but are making a personal choice based on their understanding of the risks and outcomes. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term often implies a lack of empathy or consideration. The author seems to be considering their child's well-being and future quality of life, which is a valid concern. They also mention they don't intend to offend those with disabilities. So, their actions are from a place of wanting to protect their child, not to discriminate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their values and concerns for their child's future, within the context of a family decision about having children. It's their right to choose based on these factors.\n"
