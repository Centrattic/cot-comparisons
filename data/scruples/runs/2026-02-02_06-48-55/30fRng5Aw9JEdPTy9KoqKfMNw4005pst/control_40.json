      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to have a kid that might go blind in their 20s because of a family condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The wife has this in her family, and it affects the men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind in his late 20s. The author is saying they don't want their child to miss out on life's joys, using their father-in-law's example who is blind, has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author isn't saying the condition isn't valid or that they look down on people with disabilities. They even mention not wanting to offend. So their stance is about not wanting to knowingly bring a child into a situation where they might face such challenges. \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential child. They might think they're protecting the child from suffering. On the other hand, others might argue that it's not for parents to decide a child's worth or quality of life, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives. Also, there's the aspect of genetic conditions\u2014maybe they could explore options like pre-implantation genetic diagnosis if they decide to have a child, but the author is choosing not to have a child at all because of this risk.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is colloquial and not a legal term. It's more about whether their reasoning is seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The author is prioritizing their own values and the potential child's future, which is a personal decision. However, some might argue that it's a form of ableism if they're devaluing the life of someone with a disability. Others might see it as a responsible decision to avoid a known hardship.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't being offensive and acknowledges the condition's impact. They're making a personal choice based on their assessment of their child's future. Since they're not making a derogatory statement about people with disabilities but rather a choice about their own family planning, it's more about personal ethics. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often aren't considered \"assholes\" if they're making a decision based on their values and not hurting others directly. The author is considering the potential suffering of their child, which is a valid concern. However, some readers might argue that assuming the child's quality of life is poor is a mistake, as people adapt and find fulfillment in different ways. But the author is not making that assumption broadly; they're using their father-in-law's situation as an example.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether it's seen as a personal right to avoid a known risk or as an ableist decision. Given the context, the author is not in the wrong because they're making a personal choice without malice towards people with disabilities. They're also aware of the genetic risk and trying to make an informed decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
