      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is considering having a child but is hesitant because his wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if he's being an asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have a child who might face such a life. He mentions his wife's father, who is blind and has a difficult life, and he doesn't want his child to endure that. He also clarifies he's not trying to offend people with disabilities and is using a throwaway account because his wife might be reading it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). Let's think about the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future suffering for the child. From a deontological perspective, some might argue that life has intrinsic value regardless of circumstances, so choosing not to have a child because of a genetic risk could be seen as wrong. But from a consequentialist view, the author is trying to prevent future suffering, which could be seen as a compassionate decision.\n\nHowever, there are other factors. The author is making a choice based on genetic probabilities. Even if they have a son, there's a 50% chance he wouldn't get it. Also, the father is making a decision that affects both parents and the potential child. The mother's feelings and her stance on the issue are not discussed here. The author's concern is about the child's quality of life, but this is a deeply personal choice. Society often respects the right to make reproductive decisions, including considering medical risks. The author isn't discriminating against someone with a disability but is considering potential risks for a future child.\n\nBut the question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" Some people might argue that he's being selfish or making a decision without fully considering the possibility of support and the child's potential to live a fulfilling life despite the condition. Others might see it as responsible planning. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong answer. However, given that the author is reflecting on his decision and is not making a judgment about people with disabilities, but rather considering his own capacity to provide a good life for his child, it's more likely that he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
