      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The author is male, and the condition affects men in the family. The wife has the condition, so their son would have a 50% chance of getting it. The author is worried about the child's quality of life, using examples like the grandfather's experience of losing his sight and not having a job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is making a personal choice based on potential future health issues. It's a common dilemma in genetics counseling\u2014whether to have children when there's a risk of a genetic disorder. The author isn't looking down on people with disabilities; they mention they don't want to be offensive. They're concerned about the child's life without vision and the challenges that come with it. \n\nBut is this the author's decision alone? The wife might have a different perspective. The author is making a choice that could affect their relationship and family planning. Also, the author is male, so the condition's inheritance pattern is important. If it's an X-linked recessive, the son would get the affected X from the mother (since the mother is a carrier) and the Y from the father. Wait, the wife has the condition\u2014so if it's X-linked recessive, she would be the carrier. Wait, actually, if the mother is a carrier, the sons have a 50% chance of getting the affected X chromosome. But if the condition is dominant, then maybe the sons would be affected if the mother has it. I need to get the genetics right here. Let me think: Retinitis Pigmentosa can be inherited in several ways\u2014autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked. If the wife has a family history where the condition affects the men, maybe it's X-linked. For example, in X-linked recessive, males have one X chromosome; if they inherit the affected one from the mother, they get the condition. The mother is a carrier (XAXa) and the father is normal (XAY), then sons have a 50% chance of XaY (affected) and 50% XAY (normal). Daughters would get XAXa (carrier) or XAXA (normal) depending on the father's contribution. Wait, the father's X is from the mother? No, the father gives Y to sons. So if the mother is a carrier, the sons get either her X or the other X. Since the mother is a carrier (XAXa), the sons would get her X or the other X. But the father's X is not involved here. So if the mother is a carrier, the sons have 50% chance of getting the affected X from her. So in the scenario described, the author and his wife are considering having a son with 50% chance of getting the condition. The author is against having a child, given that possibility. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for this. From a personal choice standpoint, people have the right to decide whether they want to have children, especially considering potential health issues. But is it morally wrong to not want to have a child with a possible disability? Some might argue that it's a personal choice, while others might say it's discriminatory. However, the author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is concerned about the child's quality of life. Also, they mention they don't want to be offensive. \n\nThe grandfather's experience is cited as an example of the possible future. But that's one person's experience; others with the condition might live fulfilling lives. The author is projecting that onto the child, which might be an overgeneralization. However, the decision to have children is deeply personal and can be influenced by such concerns. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing avoiding the risk of a severe condition for the child. Ethically, parents do consider the well-being of their children when making such decisions. If there's a significant risk of a condition that severely impacts quality of life, it's reasonable for the author to be hesitant. However, the other parent's perspective is also important. The wife might have a different view, possibly wanting to have a child despite the risk. The author's stance could lead to conflict in the relationship, but that's part of the personal dynamics.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks at intent and harm. The author's intent isn't to harm but to avoid what they see as a harmful outcome. They're not discriminating against someone with the condition but are making a choice based on their assessment of the child's future. So, the answer is likely B (not the asshole) because it's a personal choice based on their values and concerns about the child's well-being.\n"
