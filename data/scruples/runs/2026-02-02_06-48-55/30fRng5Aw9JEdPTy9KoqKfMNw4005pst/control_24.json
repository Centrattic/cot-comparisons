      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his wife are considering having kids. The wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men and can lead to blindness by their 20s. The author is saying he doesn't want to put a child through that, referencing his wife's father who is blind and can't work or have a social life. The author is questioning if not wanting to have a boy who might end up blind makes him the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Retina Pigmentosa (RP) is. It's a genetic disorder causing progressive vision loss, leading to blindness. It's hereditary, and in this case, it affects males in the family. The author is worried about the 50% chance for a son to inherit this. He's not against having a child per se, but the potential risk. He also clarifies he's not trying to be offensive.\n\nThe question is about morality. Is the author wrong for not wanting to have a child that could face such a condition? Let's break it down. On one hand, genetic conditions can be a heavy burden. Parents often consider health risks when planning for children. On the other hand, some might argue that life is worth living despite challenges and that parents should not make that decision for their child. But the author is specifically concerned about the quality of life and the child's future. He's not making a judgment about the value of people with disabilities but is concerned about the child's experience.\n\nIn ethics, this touches on the non-identity problem\u2014since the child wouldn't exist without the parents, it's hard to say they're wronging them. Also, parents do have the right to consider medical risks when deciding to have children. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) could be an option if they want to proceed, but the author is choosing not to have a child who might face this. \n\nThe author is clear he's not being patronizing and is aware of the sensitivities. His reasoning is based on wanting to avoid suffering, which is a valid concern. The father's own example (wife's father) shows the real-world impact. While some might argue that people with RP can lead fulfilling lives, the author is making a personal choice based on his values and the potential for a difficult life for the child. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. His decision is based on a desire to prevent harm, which is a common parental instinct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
