      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might inherit retinitis pigmentosa, which leads to blindness in their 20s. The author's main concern is that their child would miss out on life's joys, like the father in the story who has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on potential future consequences for their child. They aren't being malicious; they're trying to avoid a difficult life for the child. The condition's hereditary nature is a factor here. Since it's X-linked and affects males, having a son gives a 50% chance of inheriting it. The author is weighing the risks and deciding against having a child who might face this.\n\nNow, is the author selfish? That's a common argument in these scenarios. People might say that life with a disability can still be fulfilling, and the author is making a judgment about their child's future. But others might see this as a responsible decision to prevent suffering. The author also clarifies they don't mean to offend those with disabilities, which is important. They're not devaluing people with disabilities but are concerned about a specific outcome.\n\nThe wife's perspective isn't mentioned, so we don't know if she's aware of the risks or if they've discussed alternatives. Maybe they could consider adoption or other reproductive options to avoid passing on the gene. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the child. The key points are the author's intention to avoid harm, the genetic risk, and the personal choice aspect.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that parents should accept their children as they come, but others support proactive decisions to prevent genetic disorders. The author isn't discriminating against people with disabilities but is considering the potential quality of life. So, the answer would hinge on whether the author's decision is seen as selfish or responsible.\n"
