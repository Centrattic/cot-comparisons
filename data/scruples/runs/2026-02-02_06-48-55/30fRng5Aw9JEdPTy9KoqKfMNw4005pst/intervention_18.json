      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child that might inherit a condition causing blindness by age 20.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's wife has a family condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The author is worried about the child missing out on life's joys, citing the grandfather's experience of being blind and having no job or social life. The author is questioning if they're being a bad person for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, the ethical angle here is about reproductive choices and genetic risks. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future outcomes. It's their right to choose whether to have children, especially when considering serious health conditions. The key points are autonomy and the right to make informed decisions about family planning. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making a judgment based on assumptions about the quality of life for someone with the condition. But the author isn't dismissing the value of life; they're considering the impact of a severe condition. The grandfather's experience is given as an example, but each person's experience can vary. \n\nGenetic counseling would typically be recommended in such cases, but the author is already considering the risks. The question is whether their decision to avoid having a child due to these risks is morally wrong. Most ethical frameworks support individual reproductive rights, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
