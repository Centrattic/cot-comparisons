      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition causing blindness by age 20. The wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. The author is questioning if it's wrong to not want to have such a child, given the potential hardships.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author isn't being discriminatory, as they mention they don't want to offend anyone. They're concerned about their child's quality of life. RP can lead to significant challenges, including loss of independence and social isolation. The father's example of his grandfather's life without sight shows the possible consequences they're worried about.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their future children. While some might argue that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, the author is considering the potential suffering and limitations their child might face. There's no legal wrong here; it's a personal decision. The key is whether the author is acting out of selfishness or genuine concern. The author clarifies they don't want to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys, which suggests they're considering the child's well-being.\n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on a desire to avoid hardship for their child. So the answer is B.\n"
