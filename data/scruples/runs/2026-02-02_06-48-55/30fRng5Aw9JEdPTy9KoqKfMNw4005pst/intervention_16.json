      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa, leading to blindness by age 20. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife are discussing having kids. The wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa that affects men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want his child to experience a life of blindness, citing examples like the husband's father who is blind, jobless, and has no social life. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to bring a child into such a situation.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? The author is considering the potential suffering of a child with a genetic condition. He's worried about the child's quality of life. On one hand, parents have the right to make choices about their family, including considering health risks. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, especially if the child could lead a fulfilling life with support.\n\nRetina Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder. If the author's wife is a carrier or affected, and the gene is X-linked (since it affects males more), the risk depends on the specific genetics. But the key here is the author's reasoning. He's prioritizing the child's potential quality of life over the desire to have a child. \n\nSome people might say that the author is making a responsible choice to avoid unnecessary suffering. Others might say that it's wrong to make such a decision based on potential outcomes, as the child could adapt and find happiness. Also, there's the aspect of disability rights, where some people argue that the choice to not have a child with a disability is a form of ableism, assuming the child would have a lower quality of life.\n\nBut the author does mention that he's not trying to be offensive and is focused on the child's well-being. The father's example of his own father's struggles is a real-life consideration. However, every child's experience is different, and there's a possibility that with advancements in medicine, future treatments might exist. Also, the author's wife might feel that this is a valid trait to pass on, especially if she's from a family where the condition is present but manageable.\n\nThe question is whether the author's decision is morally wrong. If the author is making an informed decision based on the best available information and the well-being of the child, then it's a personal choice. However, if the decision is based on unfounded fears or discriminatory attitudes, then he might be in the wrong. The author's reasoning seems to be based on the potential hardships the child could face, which is a common consideration in reproductive decisions.\n\nIn the context of AITA, the judgment often depends on societal norms and whether the person is being unreasonable. Here, the author is considering a significant medical issue that could impact the child's life. It's a tough call, but I think it's a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The key is that the author isn't being cruel but is making a decision based on their values and the child's future. However, if the wife wants a child and the author is against it solely due to the genetic risk, that could lead to conflict. But the question is about the author's moral standing, not the conflict itself. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's making a decision based on his beliefs about his child's future quality of life, which is a personal and ethical consideration.\n"
