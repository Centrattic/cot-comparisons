      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a couple discussing having children, and the wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa that affects men. The husband is concerned about a boy potentially going blind by 20s, leading to a life without a job or social life. He's wondering if he's an asshole for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethics here. The husband is making a personal choice based on potential future consequences. He's not making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering the quality of life for his child. The question is whether it's wrong to choose not to have a child who might have a certain medical condition.\n\nI should consider the principles involved. Autonomy: parents have the right to make reproductive choices. Also, the intention matters. The husband isn't discriminating against people with disabilities but is worried about the child's well-being. The post also clarifies that they don't want to offend anyone. \n\nHowever, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, choosing against a life with a disability. But the husband's reasoning is about the child's quality of life and the potential hardships. The father's example (grandfather who can't see his kids, no job/social life) is used to illustrate the possible future. \n\nThe key here is that the decision is based on the best available information and the parents' desire to avoid suffering. Since it's about their own reproductive choice, it's a personal decision. Unless there's a guarantee, and even then, it's a gamble. The husband is not forcing someone else's hand but making a choice for their family.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a difficult decision based on his values and the information he has, without intending to harm or discriminate.\n"
