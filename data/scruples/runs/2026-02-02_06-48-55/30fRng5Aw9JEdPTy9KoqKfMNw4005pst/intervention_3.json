      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting to have a child that might go blind due to a genetic condition. The condition, Retinita pigmentosa, affects males in the wife's family with a 50% chance of blindness by late 20s. The author is worried about their son's future, using the example of the wife's father who is blind and has a difficult life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical viewpoints. One perspective is that it's a parent's right to avoid bringing a child into the world if there's a high risk of suffering. They might think they're preventing a life of hardship. On the other hand, some argue that life's value isn't diminished by disability, and that parents should embrace whatever comes, providing support and love regardless.\n\nThe author mentions they don't want to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys. That could be seen as making a judgment about the quality of life for someone with a disability. However, it's also about their own capacity to handle the situation. Maybe they feel unprepared or fear not being able to support a child with such a condition.\n\nAnother angle is the possibility of the child leading a fulfilling life despite the condition. The wife's father is given as an example of a difficult life, but maybe that's not the only outcome. The author's reasoning is based on a specific negative example, but the child might have a different experience with modern medical advances or personal resilience.\n\nAlso, the author emphasizes they don't intend to offend, which shows awareness. However, the decision to not have a child based on potential disability is controversial. Some say it's a personal choice, while others see it as a form of ableism, implying that a life with disability isn't worth living.\n\nThe key is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own fears over potentially having a child who might have a fulfilling life. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong. But given the options, the debate is between A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the author is making a personal choice based on their values and concerns, and without intending to discriminate, it's plausible that the answer is B, they're not in the wrong. However, others might argue the opposite. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and considering the context of personal ethics and parental choice, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
