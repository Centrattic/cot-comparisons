      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). The author explains that the condition affects men in the wife's family and there's a 50% chance their son would go blind by late 20s. They mention not wanting their child to miss out on life's joys, citing an example of the grandfather who's blind and has no job or social life. The author clarifies they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal decision based on the potential suffering of their child. On one hand, they might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort or avoiding responsibility. On the other hand, they're trying to protect their child from a life of hardship. \n\nGenetic counseling comes into play here. If they haven't consulted a professional, maybe they're not fully informed. But the post doesn't mention that. The author's concern is about quality of life for the child, which is a common ethical consideration in reproductive decisions.\n\nSocietal views vary. Some might argue that it's selfish not to take the risk, while others might see it as responsible family planning. The key is whether the author is being discriminatory. The author emphasizes not wanting to patronize or hurt anyone, so it's possible they're making a personal choice without malice.\n\nThe grandfather example shows real-life consequences. If the grandfather's life is severely impacted, the author could be trying to prevent that for their child. However, others might say that with modern medicine and support systems, life with RP can be manageable, and it's not the parents' place to decide such things.\n\nAlso, the fact that the condition affects men specifically might influence the decision. If they can choose to have a daughter instead, that's an option. But if they're open to having a daughter, maybe the author's stance is more about a 50% risk for a son rather than a blanket opposition to children. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the decision is considered selfish or a responsible choice. Since the author is making a personal decision based on potential future suffering and not out of prejudice, they might not be the asshole. But there's a counterargument that they're avoiding the challenges that come with disabilities. \n\nOverall, the ethical stance here is nuanced. But given the author's expressed concern for the child's well-being and not intending to offend, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong). They're making a tough choice based on medical risk and potential quality of life, which is a personal decision.\n"
