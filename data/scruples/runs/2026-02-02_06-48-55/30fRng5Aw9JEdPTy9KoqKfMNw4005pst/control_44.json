      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The father is concerned about the child's quality of life, citing examples like his father-in-law who's blind and has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future suffering for the child. On one hand, he's trying to prevent his child from experiencing a life-altering condition. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to not have a child based on genetic predispositions, especially if the child could lead a fulfilling life despite the condition.\n\nI should also consider the medical aspect. RP is a genetic disorder; if the wife is a carrier, there's a 50% chance for male children. The author is using this information to make an informed choice. But is it ethical to decide against parenthood based on a potential condition? It's a personal choice, but societal views on disability and parenthood vary.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't dismissing the value of people with disabilities but is concerned about the child's quality of life. He's not making a judgment about people with RP but is evaluating the risks for his future child. The key is whether the decision is made with empathy and understanding. Since he clarifies he's not being patronizing, it's more about his personal comfort with potential hardships.\n\nAlso, the use of a throwaway account suggests he's trying to keep the discussion private, which is common in such forums. The wife's possible lurking adds a personal dynamic but doesn't directly affect the ethical evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal one. While it may be seen as a difficult choice, it's not necessarily wrong if it's based on informed consent and a desire to prevent suffering. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
