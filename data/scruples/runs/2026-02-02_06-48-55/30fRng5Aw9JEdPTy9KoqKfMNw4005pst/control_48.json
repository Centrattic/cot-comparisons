      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa (RP), especially if it's a boy because the father's side has a 50% chance of passing it. The condition leads to blindness by late 20s. They mention their father-in-law's experience, who is blind and has no job or social life. The user is concerned about depriving their child of life's joys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The user is making a personal choice based on the potential suffering of their child. They're not trying to offend but are genuinely worried about the quality of life. On the other hand, someone might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child based on a genetic condition, implying that people with disabilities have less valuable lives. But the user is making a choice for their family, not making a judgment about others. They also clarify they don't want to offend anyone.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Ethically, it's more complex. The user is considering the child's future well-being. However, predicting a child's experience is speculative. The father-in-law's life is one example, but others with RP might have different experiences, perhaps with adaptations or support. The user's fear is based on a specific scenario, but it's possible that with modern medicine or support systems, the child could lead a fulfilling life.\n\nThe user is also being honest about their feelings, which is important in a relationship. They're discussing this with their wife, so it's a mutual decision. The key point is whether it's ethical to decide not to have a child based on a genetic risk. Some argue that it's a personal choice, while others see it as a form of eugenics. But the user isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities; they're considering their own capacity to provide a good life for their child.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong. Their concern is about their child's future quality of life, and they're making a difficult decision based on that. They're not discriminatory but are weighing potential hardships. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
