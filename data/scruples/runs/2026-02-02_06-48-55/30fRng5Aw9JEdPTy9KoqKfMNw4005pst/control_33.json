      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether they should have a child given a genetic condition that could cause blindness in their son later in life. The author is saying they don't want to subject their child to that life, where the father's example shows someone who lost his sight and lost his job and social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is a parent who is concerned about their child's future quality of life. They don't want their child to suffer from a condition that could lead to blindness, which they see as taking away the joys of life. But is that a valid reason? Or is it being discriminatory?\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a personal choice about whether to have a child, which is their right. They're considering the potential suffering and challenges their child might face. On the other hand, people with disabilities have rights and lead fulfilling lives despite their conditions. The author's statement could be seen as implying that a life with blindness isn't worth living, which might be considered ableist.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to \"deprive\" the child, but that phrasing might be problematic. It could suggest that the child wouldn't have the same opportunities, but many blind individuals adapt and find happiness. The father's example is someone who lost his vision and had difficulties, but that's one person's experience. It's possible that with proper support, a child could navigate life differently.\n\nThe author also states they aren't trying to offend, but the question is if their reasoning is wrong. The key point is whether it's acceptable to choose not to have a child based on a potential disability. It's a personal decision, but if the reasoning is based on a belief that a disabled life is worse, that could be seen as the problem.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, it's about whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they are making a choice based on their values and the potential impact on their child, some might say they are not wrong. Others might argue that they're making a judgment about a life that the child could still lead. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but there's nuance here. The author is making a personal ethical decision, and while their reasoning could be critiqued for ableism, the act of choosing not to have a child due to potential genetic issues isn't inherently wrong in a moral sense.\n"
