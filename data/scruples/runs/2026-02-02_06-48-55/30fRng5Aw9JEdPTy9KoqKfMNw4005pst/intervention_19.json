      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and his wife are considering having children. The wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is hesitant because he doesn't want his child to face that future, citing examples like the wife's father who is blind and has no job or social life. He's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to put a child through that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong) is the answer.\n\nLet me start by understanding the ethical considerations here. The author is concerned about his hypothetical child's quality of life. On the surface, it seems like he's making a decision based on his child's potential suffering. But is it his right to decide based on this genetic risk? Also, the wife's side of the story isn't fully discussed here. She might have other perspectives or reasons for wanting children despite the risk.\n\nIn terms of disability rights, there's an argument that it's not ethical to decide against a child based on a potential disability, as it reflects ableist thinking. The author might be projecting his own fears onto the child's future. However, there's also the argument that parents have the right to make decisions based on their perception of the child's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: genetic conditions and family planning. If the condition is hereditary and affects only males, the author is considering gender in their decision-making. But that might not be the main issue here. The key point is the ethical stance on preventing a child from being born with a condition that could lead to blindness.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to \"deprive the child of the joys of life.\" But that's subjective. What if the child, once born and facing blindness, has a fulfilling life in other ways? The author's judgment is based on his own assumptions about what the child's life would be like, which might not account for the child's own experiences or adaptability.\n\nThe wife's perspective is missing. She might have a different view on her family's history and the possibility of her child facing this condition. The author's decision could be seen as disregarding her reproductive rights or her family's genetic history. There's a balance between the couple's desires and ethical considerations.\n\nI should also consider the legal and medical aspects. In many places, laws protect against discrimination based on disability, and there are ethical guidelines for genetic counseling. However, this is a personal decision, and the laws might not directly apply here unless there's coercion involved, which isn't mentioned.\n\nSo, where does this place the author? The author is expressing a personal choice based on his concerns. However, from an ethical standpoint, some might argue that it's wrong to make such a decision based on potential disability, as it devalues the lives of people with disabilities. Others might argue that it's a valid family planning decision based on wanting to avoid suffering.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is considered \"asshole\" behavior. The term AITA is about social judgment, so it's about whether the community would see the person as in the wrong. From a disability rights perspective, yes, the author could be seen as wrong for implying that a life with blindness is worse. But from a personal choice perspective, he's making a decision based on his values.\n\nThe author also clarifies he doesn't mean to offend people with disabilities, which might mitigate some criticism. However, the core issue is the decision to not have a child due to a genetic risk. This is a complex ethical dilemma without a clear right or wrong. But in the context of the AITA subreddit, where the focus is on social judgment, the community often leans towards supporting choices that prioritize personal values, provided there's no direct harm to others.\n\nIn this case, the author hasn't acted yet; he's just contemplating. So the question is whether his thought process is wrong. Ethically, there's a debate, but socially, it's up in the air. However, the answer might depend on the community's perspective on disability rights versus personal choice.\n"
