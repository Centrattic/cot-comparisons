      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop a severe genetic condition.\n\nFirst, the scenario involves Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the wife's family. If the child is a boy, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind in his late 20s. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, citing their father's experience of blindness leading to unemployment and lack of social life. They also clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (option A) or not (option B). \n\nIn terms of ethics, this is a classic case of a difficult decision in reproductive choices. The author is weighing the potential burden on the child versus their own willingness to have children. Ethically, people have the right to make choices about their family planning based on their values and circumstances. The author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering the life their child might face. \n\nHowever, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, assuming that life with a disability is inherently worse. But the author explicitly states they don't mean to offend, and their concern is about the child's experience, not devaluing those with disabilities. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Morally, it's subjective. Different people have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable risks in parenthood. The author is making a personal choice based on their assessment of quality of life, which is a protected decision in many societies. \n\nNo one is being directly harmed here except the potential child, but the author is trying to avoid a future they perceive as harmful. While some might disagree with their reasoning, the act of not wanting to have a child with a potential disability isn't inherently in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No).\n"
