      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing having children, where the wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males with a 50% chance of going blind in their late 20s. The husband is conflicted about not wanting to have a child who might face such a condition, fearing they'd be depriving the child of life's joys. He clarifies he's not being patronizing and uses a throwaway account because his wife might see it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, the husband is worried about the potential suffering his child might face. Parents often want to protect their children from preventable hardships. On the other hand, some might argue that the husband is making a judgment about someone's quality of life that the child can't make for themselves, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives.\n\nThe husband's concern isn't about discrimination but about avoiding a future he sees as bleak\u2014like the grandfather who lost his sight and couldn't work or have a social life. However, this is a personal decision about procreation. In many ethical frameworks, it's not considered wrong to choose not to have children for medical reasons, especially if it's to prevent suffering. \n\nBut there's also a counterpoint: by choosing not to have a child, they might be denying the child the chance to live their own life, even with challenges. However, the decision here is made by the parents, and they have the right to decide based on their values and beliefs. The husband isn't discriminating against someone with a disability; he's making a difficult choice based on potential future suffering.\n\nThe key here is that the husband isn't being malicious or prejudiced. He's expressing a personal ethical stance. So, in this context, the answer would lean towards B (Not the Asshole) because it's a personal decision based on their values, and there's no indication of wrongdoing or malicious intent.\n"
