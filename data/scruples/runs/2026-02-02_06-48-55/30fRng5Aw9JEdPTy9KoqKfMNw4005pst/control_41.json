      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing having children. The wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The husband is worried about subjecting a child to that life, given examples like the wife's father who became blind and lost his job and social life. He's asking if he's an asshole for not wanting to have a child who might face that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The husband's concern is about not wanting to deprive a child of life's joys due to a potential severe disability. The wife's condition is genetic, and they're aware of the risks. The question is whether his stance is wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's the principle of autonomy\u2014parents have the right to make decisions about their family. However, there's also the argument that bringing a child into the world with a potential debilitating condition could be considered unethical if it's preventable. But in this case, it's a genetic risk, not a choice. The husband is making a decision based on potential future suffering. \n\nSome might argue that it's not the husband's place to decide the child's future, and that a child with RP could still have a fulfilling life. Others might side with the husband, thinking it's responsible to avoid passing on a severe hereditary condition. The husband also clarifies he's not being offensive to people with disabilities, so his intentions are not to look down on them but to prevent suffering. \n\nThe wife's side has a family history, so it's not certain the child will be affected. The husband is weighing the risk against the potential quality of life. The post is seeking validation for his feelings without judgment. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the husband isn't causing harm but is making a personal choice based on his values. The answer would depend on societal views on eugenics vs. personal choice. Since the question is whether he's the asshole, the community often considers intent and harm. Since he's not being malicious but is concerned, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
