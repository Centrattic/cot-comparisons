      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might get Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which causes blindness in men around age 20. The author is concerned about their son's quality of life and doesn't want to subject the child to that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Personal reproductive choices are usually seen as personal. People have the right to decide whether to have children based on their circumstances. The author isn't being discriminatory towards those already living with disabilities but is considering the potential future of their child. That's different from looking down on someone else's condition.\n\nNext, the author clarifies they don't intend to offend or be patronizing. That's important. They're not criticizing people with disabilities but are making a personal choice about having a child. The father who has RP and his struggles are mentioned as an example of the possible future they want to avoid for their son.\n\nThe key here is the intent. The author is making a personal decision based on their values and the potential suffering of their child. Society often respects the right to choose not to have children for various reasons. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation, this seems like a personal choice.\n\nAlso, the author uses a throwaway account because they know their wife is watching. This shows they're trying to be discreet but not malicious. There's no evidence they're being selfish or harmful beyond their own decision-making.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether they're being unreasonable or cruel. Since they're considering the child's well-being and not discriminating against existing people, it's more about their personal ethical stance. There's no indication they're spreading harmful stereotypes or making harmful generalizations about people with disabilities.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their assessment of their future child's quality of life, without malice or discrimination.\n"
