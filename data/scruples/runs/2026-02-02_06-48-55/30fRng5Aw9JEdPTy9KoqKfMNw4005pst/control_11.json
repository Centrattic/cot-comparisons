      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the scenario again. The user is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have a child who might go blind in their 20s due to Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects the men in their wife's family. The author is saying they don't want to deprive their child of life's joys, citing their father-in-law's situation where he went blind and has no job or social life. They also clarify they're not trying to offend anyone with a disability.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of the situation. The author is making a personal choice about having children based on potential future health issues. They're not discriminating against someone who already has the condition but are considering the risks of passing it on. \n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic disorder that can lead to blindness. If the wife has this condition and it's X-linked (as some forms are), then male children have a 50% chance of inheriting it. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a son who might go blind in his 20s. They mention not wanting their child to miss out on life's joys, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here are autonomy in reproductive choices, genetic counseling, and the ethical implications of bringing a child into the world with a potential severe condition. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, parents have the right to make decisions about their family planning, including considering genetic risks. However, some might argue that the author is making a judgment about the value of life with a disability. On the other hand, others might see it as a responsible decision to avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nI should also consider the father-in-law's life. The author isn't dismissing his life but is using his experience as a cautionary example. The author emphasizes they don't want their son to have a similar fate. It's important to note that the author isn't opposing having children entirely but is specifically concerned about the risk of this condition.\n\nThere's also the aspect of not wanting to impose on the child's future. Parents often consider various factors when deciding to have children, including health risks, financial stability, etc. This seems similar to deciding not to have children if one has a genetic disorder that could affect them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that life with a disability can be fulfilling, and the author's perspective could be seen as ableist. But the author explicitly states they don't mean to offend and are focused on the child's potential future. \n\nGenetic counseling could be a resource here, but the author is already aware of the risks. The decision to have a child is deeply personal. The author isn't forcing their wife to have children; they're expressing their own feelings. The wife might have different views, but the question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the author is making a personal choice based on their understanding of the risks and their desire to avoid their child's suffering. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to have children, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
