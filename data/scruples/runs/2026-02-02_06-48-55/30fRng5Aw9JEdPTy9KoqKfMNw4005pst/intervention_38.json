      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might go blind due to a genetic condition. The situation is that the author's wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men and causes blindness in the late 20s. The author is concerned about their son potentially having this condition and not wanting their child to miss out on life's joys, citing the father's example who lost his sight and can't work or socialize. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting that for their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author isn't saying they don't want a child with disabilities in general, but specifically this condition that leads to blindness later in life. They mention they don't mean to be offensive and clarify that the question is about the specific risk. The key point here is reproductive decision-making and the ethical stance on having children with potential disabilities.\n\nThere's a philosophical debate around this. Some argue that parents have the right to make decisions based on their understanding of what's best for their child's future. Others might argue that life with disabilities can still be fulfilling and that the author is making assumptions about what their child would experience. However, in this case, the author is not dismissing the value of life with a disability but is concerned about the specific quality of life issues related to blindness, such as limited opportunities and the impact on the child's experiences.\n\nThe author also clarifies that they don't intend to be patronizing or hurtful. They\u2019re focusing on the potential hardships, not on devaluing people with disabilities. The father's example is used to highlight the possible future scenarios, but it's a personal consideration in their decision-making.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, parents are generally allowed to make such decisions based on their values and beliefs. The question is more about societal judgment rather than legal wrong. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal views. Some might see it as a responsible decision to avoid unnecessary suffering, while others might view it as playing God or making assumptions about the child's quality of life.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author isn't being malicious but is expressing a personal choice based on their concerns. They\u2019re not attacking anyone with the condition but are making a decision for their family. The key is that they're not discriminating against their future child but are considering the potential hardships they might face.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal and parental concerns rather than malice. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
