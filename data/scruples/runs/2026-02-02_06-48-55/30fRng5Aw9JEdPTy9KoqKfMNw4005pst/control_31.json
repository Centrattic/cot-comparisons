      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa (RP), which can lead to blindness by age 20. The question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is considering having a child but is worried because his wife has a family history of RP that affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is expressing concern about subjecting their child to such a life, referencing their wife's father who is blind and has a difficult life. They clarify they don't intend to be offensive to people with disabilities.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is ethics around reproductive choices and disability. There's a lot of debate around this. Some might argue that the author is being selfish or making a judgment about the value of life with a disability. Others might say it's a personal decision based on the potential quality of life for the child and the parents' ability to cope.\n\nThe author isn't making a derogatory statement about people with disabilities; they're expressing concern about the child's future. They also mention not wanting to deprive the child of joys. However, the decision to have children involves many factors, including genetic risks. People often make decisions based on health risks, like avoiding certain activities for safety. But when it comes to disability, there's a sensitivity because it's about a person's identity and worth.\n\nIn disability rights perspectives, people might argue that life with a disability can be fulfilling and that the author is making an assumption about the child's happiness. Others might support the decision, believing that parents should have the right to avoid putting their child through a life with significant challenges.\n\nThe author isn't outright saying people with RP shouldn't exist, but they're choosing not to have a child who could inherit it. This is complex. It's not about discrimination against an existing person but about future possibilities. The line between responsible decision-making and making a value judgment is thin here.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is considered selfish or a valid personal choice. Since they're not attacking people with disabilities but are making a decision based on potential future quality of life, many might side with the author. However, some might still think they're in the wrong for not accepting that people with disabilities can have meaningful lives. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
