      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a prospective parent who is considering having a child with their wife. The wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) that affects males in her family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The author is questioning their own feelings about potentially bringing a child into a situation where he might face such a severe disability and the associated challenges, like the father's experience of not being able to work or have a social life. The author is worried about depriving the child of life's joys and is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is not opposed to disability in general; they clarify they don't intend to offend anyone. Their concern is specifically about the potential for a severe, late-onset disability that could significantly impact the child's life. The key points here are the decision to have children, the genetic risk, and the author's personal feelings about that risk.\n\nIn terms of bioethics, there's a lot of debate around whether it's ethical to conceive a child who might inherit a serious genetic disorder. Some argue that it's a parent's right to make such decisions based on their understanding of the child's potential future. Others might argue that life's value isn't diminished by disability and that the parents should not preemptively decide based on their own fears.\n\nLooking at the specific details: the condition affects males, and the child would only be at risk if they have a son. The father's relative (the grandfather) is blind and has a diminished quality of life. The author is concerned about the child's future quality of life. The author isn't dismissing the value of a disabled life but is expressing a personal choice based on wanting to provide the best possible life for their child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (option A) or not in the wrong (option B). In AITA terms, the community often looks at intent, harm caused, and whether the person's actions are reasonable. The author is sharing their feelings and seeking validation, not making a public accusation against their wife. They are considering their own values and the potential impact on their child. Since the decision to have children is personal and the author isn't being offensive or discriminatory, it's likely they're not the asshole here. The answer would be B.\n"
