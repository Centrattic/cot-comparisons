      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this is the asshole (in the wrong) for not wanting to have a kid that might go blind due to a genetic condition in their wife's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their wife are considering having children. The wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind by his late 20s. The person is questioning if it's wrong to not want to bring a child into the world who might face such a severe condition. They mention examples like the wife's father, who's blind, and how his life has been affected. The poster clarifies they're not trying to offend anyone with disabilities and created a throwaway account because their wife might see it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ethical dilemma of having a child with a high risk of a debilitating condition, the potential quality of life for the child, and the poster's personal stance on not wanting to subject their child to such a life.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the poster is making a personal choice based on their values and the desire to protect their child from a difficult life. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives despite challenges.\n\nThe question is whether the poster is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral philosophy perspective, different frameworks might lead to different conclusions. Utilitarianism might focus on the happiness and suffering\u2014avoiding a life filled with potential suffering for the child could be seen as right. Deontological ethics might look at whether the action is a violation of a duty or right, like the right to life. There's also the principle of autonomy\u2014the parents' right to make reproductive choices versus the child's right to exist without such conditions.\n\nAdditionally, societal attitudes vary. Some people believe that parents have the right to make such decisions based on their circumstances, while others argue that it's a form of ableism to not want a child with a disability. However, the poster is specifically concerned about a condition that causes blindness, which significantly impacts life, not just minor issues.\n\nThe poster also mentions not wanting to \"deprive\" the child of life's joys, implying a belief that such a life would lack quality. However, people with disabilities often advocate for being seen as having meaningful lives, and the decision to not have a child based on this could be seen as making an assumption about the child's future happiness.\n\nBut on the other hand, the parents are trying to make an informed choice about their family's future. They are considering the potential hardships and making a decision that aligns with their values and what they believe is best for the child.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex issue. The answer likely depends on one's ethical standpoint. However, given the information, the poster is expressing a personal choice based on their assessment of their future child's well-being. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to have a child despite the risks, which there isn't, the decision is a personal one. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
