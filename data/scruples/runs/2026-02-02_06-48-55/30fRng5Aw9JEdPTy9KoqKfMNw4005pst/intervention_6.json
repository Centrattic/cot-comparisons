      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering not having children because there's a risk their son could inherit retinitis pigmentosa, leading to blindness by 20s. They mention not wanting their child to experience a life similar to the father's, who is blind and has a hard time with work and social life. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for this stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on potential future consequences for their child. There's the issue of eugenics or selective breeding, which can be controversial. However, parents often make decisions to avoid putting their children in harmful situations. For example, avoiding certain dangerous areas or environments. Here, the concern is about a genetic condition that significantly impacts quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, especially if the child could still lead a fulfilling life with support. The author clarifies they don't want to patronize or hurt those with disabilities, which is a good point. They're making a personal choice, not making a judgment about the value of people with disabilities.\n\nAnother angle is autonomy. The author has the right to decide whether to have children based on their own values and what they believe is best for their potential child. However, there's a debate about whether it's right to not bring a child into the world who might want to exist, even with challenges. But since the child can't consent, parents must make that call.\n\nI should also think about the percentage chance. The risk is 50% for a son. The author isn't saying they won't have children if it's a girl, so they're considering gender in their decision. That might be another layer, but the question is more about the overall choice to avoid the risk.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't being malicious. They're expressing concern for their child's well-being. But others might see it as selfish to avoid the responsibility of supporting a child with a disability. However, the author is prioritizing the child's quality of life, which is a common parental instinct.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's decision is a personal one, and while some might disagree, it's not necessarily wrong. They're making a choice based on their understanding of what's best for their potential child. The answer would depend on whether society views this choice as ethically acceptable. Since the author isn't discriminating against existing people but planning for future scenarios, their stance might be seen as not in the wrong.\n"
