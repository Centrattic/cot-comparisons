      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to have children because of a genetic condition that could lead to blindness in their sons. The author is worried about the child's quality of life, citing examples like the father who is blind and the negative impacts on his life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice based on concerns for their future child's well-being. They don't want to bring a child into the world with a significant risk of a life-altering condition. This could be seen as a responsible decision, prioritizing the child's future happiness and avoiding unnecessary suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is making a judgment based on assumptions about the child's life. People with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and the author's perspective might be influenced by their own biases or societal attitudes. The author also mentions not wanting to \"deprive\" the child of life's joys, but that's their own view, which others might see as patronizing, even if they say they don't mean to be.\n\nThe author clarifies they don't intend to offend, which is a good point. The decision is a personal one, and while it's not necessarily malicious, it's important to consider the implications. The wife's perspective isn't discussed, but the author is making a choice that affects both of them. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child under these circumstances.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, utilitarianism would look at the overall happiness. The author is trying to prevent suffering but also avoiding bringing a child into a situation with a high risk of disability. Deontological ethics might focus on the morality of the act itself\u2014choosing not to have a child because of a genetic risk isn't inherently immoral. \n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive rights and personal choice. People have the right to make decisions about whether to have children based on their personal values and circumstances. However, the concern is that the author might be underestimating the child's ability to live a meaningful life despite the condition. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being selfish or making a reasoned decision. If they are acting out of genuine concern for the child's well-being, it's more understandable. The example given about the grandfather not having a job or social life might be specific to that individual's choices, not necessarily the condition's effects. So, the author's reasoning might be based on a fear of the condition's consequences rather than the actual experience of those with the condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal choice and not inherently wrong. They are making a difficult decision about parenthood based on potential future outcomes. While others might have different views, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing the child's quality of life in this context. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
