      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about them and their wife discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) that affects men, giving them a 50% chance of going blind in their late 20s. The author is worried about their son potentially suffering from the condition and not wanting their child to be deprived of life's joys, like the author's father-in-law who is blind and has no job or social life. They also mention they're not trying to patronize or hurt anyone, and it's a throwaway account because the wife is lurking.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, Retinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder. If the wife carries it and it's an X-linked condition, each son has a 50% chance of inheriting it. The author is expressing concern about bringing a child into the world with a potential debilitating condition. The ethical angle here is a classic debate: is it wrong to not have a child if there's a risk of a serious genetic condition?\n\nThe author's reasoning is about preventing the child from experiencing life's joys and the father-in-law's example of being blind with no job/social life. They\u2019re worried about their son's quality of life. But is that valid? Many people with RP lead fulfilling lives, even if they eventually lose their vision. The father-in-law's lack of social life might be due to personal choices or other factors, not necessarily the condition itself. The author is making an assumption about how their son's life would be based on their father-in-law's experience, which might not be accurate or fair.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't consulted a genetic counselor or considered the actual impact of RP on the child's life. They might not be aware of the support systems, assistive technologies, or the potential for a good life despite the condition. By not wanting to have a child because of this risk, the author is making a personal choice, but is that choice unethical? There's a difference between making a decision based on realistic, consulted information and making one based on fear and stereotypes.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is being discriminatory or making an informed, compassionate decision. If they're not wanting to risk their child's future well-being based on a known genetic risk, that's a personal choice, but if they're using that as a reason to avoid having a child and not considering the possibility of support and adaptation, maybe they are in the wrong. The post doesn't mention if they've discussed this with the wife or considered alternative options like genetic testing for the fetus. The author might be projecting their fears onto the child's potential future without understanding the actual quality of life people with RP have.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're voicing their concerns about their future child's quality of life. However, there's a risk of their view being based on misconceptions. But since the question is about whether they're the asshole, the answer could be B, not in the wrong, because it's their right to make such a decision based on their values and what they believe is best for their child. But others might argue that it's their own fear and not considering the child's potential to live a meaningful life. However, the post doesn't show malice; it's more about personal ethics. I think the answer is B.\n"
