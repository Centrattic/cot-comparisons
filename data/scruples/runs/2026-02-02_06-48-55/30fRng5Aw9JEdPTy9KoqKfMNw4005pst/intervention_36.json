      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not wanting a child that could potentially go blind in their 20s is in the wrong. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is considering having a child, but there's a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) that affects males in the family, leading to blindness in late 20s. The author is worried about bringing a child into the world who might suffer from this condition, especially since his father-in-law is blind and has a poor quality of life. The author is concerned about the child's future and the potential hardships. \n\nNow, the key points here are the ethical considerations of reproductive choices. The author isn't making a judgment about disabled individuals but is making a personal decision based on the potential suffering of their child. The post also mentions they don't intend to be patronizing or offensive. \n\nIn ethical terms, this relates to the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) and the parents' responsibility to consider the well-being of their child. Some might argue that the author is making a selfish decision by not wanting to bring a child into a situation with a high risk of suffering. Others might argue that the author is being responsible and trying to prevent their child from a life of hardship.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author is considering the child's quality of life and potential hardships. They're not dismissing the value of life for someone with RP but are concerned about the specific challenges. The decision to have children is deeply personal and can be influenced by many factors, including inheritable conditions. \n\nThe father-in-law's experience is cited as an example, showing real-life consequences. The author might be trying to avoid their child facing similar issues. While some might argue that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives and that the author shouldn't assume the child's quality of life, others would respect the author's right to make such a personal choice based on their assessment of the child's future.\n\nThe question of being an \"asshole\" here hinges on intent and empathy. The author claims they don't want to deprive the child of joys and doesn't intend to be offensive. If they are making an informed decision without discrimination, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are making assumptions about the child's life without considering their own potential adaptability or the child's future experiences, that could be seen as problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision is a complex ethical issue without a clear right or wrong. The author's stance is based on concern for their child's future, and while some might criticize it as overcautious, others would support the choice to prevent potential suffering. Since the author is not discriminatory in intent and is considering the child's well-being, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
