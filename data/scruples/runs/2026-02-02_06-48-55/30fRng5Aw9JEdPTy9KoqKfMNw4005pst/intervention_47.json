      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should have a child knowing there's a 50% chance the son could go blind in his late 20s due to a hereditary condition. \n\nFirst, the author is concerned about their child's future quality of life. They mention not wanting to deprive the child of the joys of life, citing their wife's uncle as an example who lost his vision and couldn't work or socialize. The author is probably trying to avoid imposing such a severe condition on their child.\n\nNow, is it wrong to not want to have a child if there's a high risk of a debilitating condition? On one hand, some people might say that life is still worth living even with disabilities, and that parents should accept their children as they come. Others might argue that parents have a responsibility to consider their children's well-being and avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nThe author does clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities, so they're not dismissing the value of life for those affected. It's more about their own decision based on potential future hardships. \n\nBut is it the author's place to make that decision? Some might say that it's a personal choice and that the author has the right to decide not to have a child in such a scenario. Others could argue that life's challenges shouldn't be a reason to avoid parenthood, as people can adapt and find happiness despite difficulties.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't judging the value of life for those with the condition but is making a personal decision based on their assessment of their child's potential future. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice and they're considering their child's well-being.\n"
