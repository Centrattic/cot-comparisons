      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and his wife are considering having a child. The wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if it's wrong to not want to have a child who might face such a condition, given the example of his wife's father who is blind and has a difficult life without a job or social life. He clarifies he's not trying to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of choosing not to have children based on potential genetic risks. The author is weighing the potential suffering of his child against the desire to have a child. On one hand, preventing a child from experiencing a life with a significant disability could be seen as protecting them from hardship. On the other hand, some might argue that life with disabilities can still have meaning and joy, and it's not for others to decide what's best for the child's future. Also, the father's father example might be influencing the author's perception, but it's possible that the father's situation is due to societal factors rather than the disability itself.\n\nAnother angle is the right to life. By choosing not to have a child who might have RP, the author is making a decision that prevents the child from existing in the first place. However, the child might not choose to have this condition, so the parents are acting in their estimation of the child's best interest. But this is a complex ethical issue. Some people believe it's ethical to prevent suffering, while others argue that every life is valuable regardless of challenges.\n\nThe author also mentions that the wife's condition is inherited by male children, which is a genetic aspect. They have a choice in whether to have children, and they're discussing it. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize avoiding a potential disability over the possibility of having a child. It's also important to note that the author is not targeting people with disabilities, so the intent isn't to discriminate but to avoid a specific hardship.\n\nI should also consider that the author is concerned about his child's future quality of life. If the child were to go blind, it might impact their opportunities and experiences. However, there's a difference between preventing a child from being born with a condition and supporting a child with it. The author's stance is about not wanting to subject a child to a life he perceives as deprived, but it's possible that with modern medicine and support systems, the child could lead a fulfilling life despite RP.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of \"not wanting to deprive the child\" might involve the author's own values and priorities. Some people might argue that it's selfish to not want to have a child who has a disability, while others see it as a responsible decision. There's also the aspect of the wife's perspective. If she's willing to take that risk and wants to have a child, the author's refusal might be seen as disregarding her wishes, which could add another layer to the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the ethical dilemma here is about parental choice versus the child's potential quality of life. The author's decision is based on preventing what he sees as suffering, but it's also about personal and societal views on disabilities. The answer might depend on whether one believes it's ethical to make such a decision for a future child and whether avoiding a specific hardship justifies not having a child at all.\n"
