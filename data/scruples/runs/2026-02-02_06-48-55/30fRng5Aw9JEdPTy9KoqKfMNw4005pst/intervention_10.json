      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The context is about a couple discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa that affects males. The author is hesitant because there's a 50% chance their son could go blind in his 20s. The question is whether the author is the asshole for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Retina Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder leading to blindness. The author is worried about the quality of life for their potential son. They mention not wanting to deprive the child of life's joys, citing the father's example who is blind, has no job, and no social life. The author clarifies they don't mean to be offensive and made a throwaway account because the wife might be lurking.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Deciding not to have a child due to potential genetic conditions is a sensitive topic. Some might argue that it's wrong to avoid parenthood based on a potential disability, while others might say it's a personal choice to avoid suffering. The author isn't against disability but is considering the quality of life. The key point is whether it's ethical to not have a child because of a possible future condition.\n\nThe author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is concerned about their child's future. The wife's family history is a known risk, and they're making an informed decision. However, some might argue that life with disabilities can still be fulfilling, and the author's perspective could be seen as ableist. But the author is clear they don't mean to offend, so maybe they're just weighing the options.\n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person is being reasonable. The author is honest about their concerns without malice. The wife's side might feel hurt, but the author's hesitation is based on genuine worries. The answer would depend on whether prioritizing a child's potential quality of life is valid. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that it's not the parent's place to decide if a child's life would be \"worse\" because the child can't choose. But others support the right to make such decisions. Given that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their values and knowledge of the condition. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
