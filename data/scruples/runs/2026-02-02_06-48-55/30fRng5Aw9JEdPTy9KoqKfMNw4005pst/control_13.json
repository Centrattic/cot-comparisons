      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's acceptable for the author to not want to have a child who could potentially develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the wife's family and can lead to blindness by their late 20s. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life and doesn't want them to suffer a similar fate as the wife's father, who has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. The author is making a decision based on potential future outcomes for their child. The key points are the genetic risk, the impact on the child's life, and the parents' responsibility. \n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder with a 50% chance for male offspring in this case. The author is worried about subjecting a child to a life where they might lose their vision, which can significantly affect their opportunities and quality of life. The author isn't dismissing the value of people with disabilities but is concerned about preventing their child from experiencing the joys life has to offer. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for making this choice. On one hand, some might argue that it's a personal choice about family planning and preventing suffering. On the other, others might say it's a form of ableism, assuming that life with a disability is inherently worse. However, the author explicitly states they don't want to offend anyone with a disability, which complicates things.\n\nI should also consider the context of the AskReddit style question. In such forums, the community often debates the nuances of such decisions. The author is trying to weigh their options responsibly, considering their child's future. Since they're not making a decision that harms someone already existing but are considering their own future child's well-being, it's more about reproductive choice. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, parents have the right to make decisions in their child's best interest, especially regarding preventable suffering. However, it's important to note that medical advancements could change outcomes, but the author is acting based on current information. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a difficult decision based on their understanding of potential harm to their child. They are not discriminating against existing people but trying to avoid a specific risk for their future child. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
