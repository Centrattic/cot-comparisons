      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa that affects men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if they should have a child, considering the potential quality of life for a son, and is worried about the child missing out on life's joys, as seen in the wife's father's experience. The author emphasizes they don't mean to patronize anyone with disabilities.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author is wrong for not wanting to have a child that might face such a condition. The question is whether their reasoning is valid or if they're being an asshole. \n\nThe author's main points are concern about their child's future and not wanting to subject them to a life with blindness and its associated challenges. They mention specific examples like the father having no job or social life. However, they clarify they don't intend to offend anyone with disabilities. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have children when there's a risk of a genetic disorder is complex. Some might argue that it's a personal choice and that the parents are considering the child's well-being. Others might think that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, assuming that people with disabilities can have fulfilling lives. \n\nRetina Pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive condition leading to blindness. While it's a significant challenge, many people with RP adapt and lead meaningful lives. The father's experience of having no job or social life might be specific to his personal circumstances rather than the disability itself. For example, lack of job opportunities could be due to societal factors or personal choices, not the disability. \n\nThe author is not making a judgment about the value of life for someone with RP but is considering the potential hardships. They are expressing a personal decision based on their understanding of the risks and the father's experience. The key here is that the decision is about their own values and what they're comfortable with as parents. \n\nIt's important to note that having a child is a major decision, and parents often consider various factors, including health risks. The author isn't opposing having a child if it's a girl, since the condition affects males. That might be a point to consider, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for their stance. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term usually implies acting selfishly or inconsiderately. The author is being honest about their feelings and concerns, not trying to harm anyone. They even mention that the post isn't meant to offend. Their reasoning is based on wanting to avoid their child's suffering, which is a parental concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is making assumptions about the quality of life for someone with RP. The father's lack of job or social life might not be inevitable for someone with the condition. Therefore, the author's decision could be based on a misunderstanding or stigma about living with a disability. \n\nHowever, since the author is making a personal choice and not making a judgment about others' lives, it's within their rights to decide whether to have children based on genetic risks. The decision is not inherently wrong unless it's based on prejudice or harmful stereotypes. The author's clarification that they don't intend to patronize is important here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their concerns and making a decision based on their understanding of the potential risks. They're considering the child's future and their own ability to provide a certain quality of life, which is a valid parental consideration.\n"
