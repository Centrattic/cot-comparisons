      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The author is considering not having a child because of a genetic condition that could affect their son. The condition is Retina Pigmentosa, which in their wife's family affects the men and leads to blindness in the late 20s. The author is worried about their child's quality of life, referencing their father-in-law's struggles with blindness, unemployment, and lack of social life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical considerations here. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future consequences. They express concern about their child's well-being, which seems genuine. However, they also mention not wanting to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys, which implies a belief that a life with this condition might be less fulfilling. \n\nBut is it ethical for someone to choose not to have a child based on a genetic risk? On one hand, parents have the right to make decisions about their family, including reproductive choices. On the other hand, there's a debate about whether it's acceptable to avoid having a child with a disability. Some argue that it's a form of ableism, while others see it as a responsible decision to prevent suffering.\n\nThe author also clarifies that they aren't being patronizing or offensive, which is important. They're not dismissing the value of life for people with disabilities but are focused on their own child's potential hardships. However, the decision to prevent a life from existing because of a risk of disability is a complex ethical issue. \n\nAnother angle is the statistical probability\u2014there's a 50% chance for a son. The author isn't choosing to terminate a pregnancy but rather deciding against having children altogether. That might be different from other AITA scenarios where someone makes a choice after conception. \n\nI should also consider the intent here. The author is looking for validation about their personal choice, not making an accusation against others. The question is whether their reasoning is flawed. The key here is whether their concern is self-centered or genuinely about their child's welfare. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, the principle of autonomy is key. Parents have the autonomy to decide their family planning, especially when considering the potential for a genetic disorder. However, some might argue that this decision stems from a lack of acceptance or support for those with disabilities. \n\nBut the author is also considering practical aspects like their father-in-law's situation, which might indicate they are being realistic about the challenges. However, it's possible that with modern medical advancements, the condition could be managed better in the future, or that the child could lead a fulfilling life despite the condition. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily being selfish; they're making a difficult decision based on their values and the information they have. They're not forcing anyone else's opinion, just sharing their dilemma. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable or harmful. Here, the author's decision doesn't directly harm anyone else; it's a personal choice. Unless they are making derogatory statements about people with disabilities, which they aren't, their stance is more about their own comfort and concerns about their future child's life. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their decision is a personal one, made with the intention to protect their future child from potential hardships. While others might disagree, it's their right to make that choice.\n"
