      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again and break it down.\n\nThe person is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to have a child who might inherit Retina Pigmentosa (RP), which causes blindness in men from their wife's family. The wife has a family history where affected men go blind in their late 20s. The author is worried about their son facing a life without sight, leading to no job, no social life, etc. They mention examples like the wife's father who can't see his kids and hasn't worked. They clarify they don't want to be offensive to people with disabilities, and they're using a throwaway account because the wife is online.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child with this genetic risk. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects of making decisions about having children based on potential disabilities. There's the idea of a \"life not worth living\" versus the belief that people with disabilities can have fulfilling lives. The author is prioritizing avoiding a future they perceive as extremely challenging for the child. On the other hand, some might argue that they're making a judgment about the quality of life of someone with RP, which could be seen as ableist.\n\nThe author also mentions that they don't want to be offensive, which is important. But the underlying assumption is that a life with RP is worse. However, people with RP might lead active lives using other senses, technology, and support systems. The father's example is someone who didn't have a job or social life, but that might not be the case for everyone with RP. Maybe with better support and accessibility, individuals could have different experiences.\n\nGenetic counseling could be a factor here. They might consider options like preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) if they decide to have children. But the author is asking if it's wrong not to want a child at all. \n\nThe key point is whether it's ethical to forgo having a child due to a genetic condition that might affect them. Some might say it's a personal choice and parents have the right to make that decision. Others might argue that it's a form of discrimination and that people with disabilities shouldn't be seen as a burden. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on their perception of the child's future quality of life. But without knowing how the child would adapt, use technology, or find fulfillment, it's speculative. There's also the risk of underestimating the child's ability to lead a meaningful life. \n\nIn terms of societal perspective, there's a movement against disability-based decisions, emphasizing that people with disabilities can have happy, productive lives. The author might be seen as making a decision based on their own biases rather than the child's potential experiences.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering the practical aspects like employment and social life, which are real challenges. But again, those are assumptions. The wife's family history might not reflect the full picture with modern support systems.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's stance is a personal choice, but the reasoning might be based on ableist assumptions. However, they are not outright wrong in choosing not to have a child; it's a complex decision. But is it the right or wrong choice? The question is whether they are in the wrong, which is a value judgment.\n\nIf the answer is A (they're in the wrong), it's because they're making a judgment about the value of life with a disability. If B (not in the wrong), it's because they're making a personal decision about their family's future based on their values.\n\nI think the answer might be B, as it's their personal choice, but some might say A because of the underlying ableism. The key is whether the decision is inherently wrong. Since the question is from an AITA perspective, the community might lean towards B because it's their choice, even if others disagree.\n"
