      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might go blind in their 20s. The author's wife has a family condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males and gives a 50% chance if the child is a boy. The author is concerned about the child's future, citing examples like his wife's father who is blind, jobless, and has no social life. The author is worried about depriving their child of life's joys.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering the potential hardships their child might face. The question is whether it's morally wrong to choose not to have a child because of a genetic risk that could lead to such a condition.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values, health, and quality of life considerations. Many parents choose not to have children for various reasons, including health risks, financial stability, or lifestyle factors. The author's concern is about their child's well-being, which is a common parental instinct.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory or eugenicist to avoid having a child due to a disability. However, the author clarifies they don't intend to offend or patronize people with disabilities. They're specifically worried about the child's future quality of life, not the disability itself.\n\nThe condition mentioned is Retinitis Pigmentosa, which leads to blindness. The author is considering the potential suffering and the challenges their child might face. It's a personal decision that involves weighing the risks and the possible outcomes. While some might argue that people can lead fulfilling lives despite disabilities, the author is focused on the specific hardships mentioned (like their father-in-law's situation).\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning could be seen as making assumptions about what their child's life would be like if they were blind. They might not account for the child's own ability to adapt, find joy, or lead a meaningful life. But the author's intention is to avoid a future they perceive as bleak, not to devalue people with disabilities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the key is whether the author is making a judgment about people with disabilities or making a personal choice based on their own capacity to provide a good life for their child. Since the author states they don't intend to offend and their reasoning is about their child's future, it's more of a personal decision rather than an act of discrimination. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a choice based on their values and concerns for their child's well-being, not out of prejudice.\n"
