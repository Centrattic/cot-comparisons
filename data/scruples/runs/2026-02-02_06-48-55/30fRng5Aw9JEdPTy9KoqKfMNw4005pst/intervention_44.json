      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might go blind in their 20s due to a genetic condition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author's wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by late 20s. The author is questioning whether it's wrong not to want to have a child who might face such a life. He gives examples like his father-in-law who has no job or social life because of blindness. The author emphasizes they don't want to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice based on their values and the potential suffering they anticipate for their child. On the other hand, others might argue that they shouldn't decide the worth of a person's life based on potential disabilities. Also, the author clarifies they aren't being patronizing, which is important.\n\nGenetic conditions are tricky. The author is aware of the risk and is weighing the quality of life for their potential child. But is it their place to make that decision? Some ethical frameworks, like rights-based, might argue that the child's right to life isn't diminished by potential disabilities. Others, like utilitarianism, might support avoiding bringing a child into a life of suffering. \n\nHowever, the author isn't choosing to cause suffering; they're avoiding a known risk. It's a proactive decision to prevent anticipated hardship. But some might say that's eugenic thinking, implying that certain lives aren't worth living. The line between compassion and discrimination can be thin here.\n\nAlso, considering the father-in-law's experience, the author is using that as a precedent. But each individual's experience with a disability is unique. The father-in-law's lack of job or social life might be due to personal choices or societal factors, not the disability itself. The author might be making assumptions about the child's future based on that example.\n\nThe author's concern is valid\u2014they don't want their child to miss out on life's joys. But does that make them an asshole? The term \"asshole\" is subjective. If the author is acting out of love and concern, even if their reasoning is flawed, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are being dismissive of the child's potential capabilities or assuming a lower quality of life, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to hurt anyone with disabilities, which shows some reflection. They created a throwaway because the wife is \"lurking,\" so there's a personal dynamic here, but that's not directly relevant to whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is based on personal values and ethics, others might argue that it's not their place to decide the value of a life with disabilities. However, the author is making a personal choice that they believe is in the best interest of their potential child. Depending on one's ethical standpoint, the answer could vary. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's a nuanced issue. However, many would argue that it's a personal choice and not necessarily wrong, especially given the author's intentions and the genetic risk involved. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
