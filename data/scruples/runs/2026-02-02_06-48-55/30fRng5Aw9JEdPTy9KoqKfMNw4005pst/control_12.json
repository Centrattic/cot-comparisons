      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and go blind in their 20s. The husband is concerned about the quality of life for a potential son and doesn't want to subject the child to such a fate. The wife has a family condition where males are affected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The husband is making a decision based on his perception of what's best for the child. He's worried about the child's future, like the father who couldn't see his kids and has no job or social life. The husband is trying to avoid that scenario for his own child. But is that a valid reason to not have children?\n\nThen, there's the aspect of reproductive rights and autonomy. The couple is discussing having kids, so it's their decision. However, if there's a genetic risk, should they proceed? The husband is considering the child's well-being. Some might argue that it's selfish to bring a child into the world with a condition that causes significant hardship. Others might say it's not his place to decide that, and the child would have the right to life, even with disabilities.\n\nThere's also the angle of ableism. If the husband is devaluing the life of someone with RP, that could be problematic. The post does mention they don't want to offend those with disabilities, but their reasoning is based on the assumption that life with RP is worse. However, people with disabilities often lead fulfilling lives, and the husband's perspective might be influenced by what he sees as limitations, not the actual experience of those with RP.\n\nAnother point is the responsibility to the child. Parents have a duty to provide care, but they also have the right to make decisions they believe are in the child's best interest. However, this is subjective. The husband's decision could be seen as a way to prevent suffering, but others might think that life with RP is manageable and worth living, with proper support.\n\nAlso, the husband is using a throwaway because the wife might be reading it, indicating they haven't resolved their differences yet. It's a personal decision that affects both partners. The wife's perspective isn't detailed here, so we don't know how she feels about the risk. If she's in favor of having children despite the risk, the husband's stance might conflict with her wishes, but the initial question is about whether he's in the wrong, not necessarily about the conflict in their relationship.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, there's no law against having a child with a genetic risk. The decision is personal and often a matter of ethics. The husband isn't forcing the child to be born; he's choosing not to have one based on potential risks. So, is that in the wrong? It's a tough call. It's not illegal or unethical per se, but some might say that by avoiding a child due to a potential disability, he's making a judgment about the value of such a life. Others might support his decision as responsible planning.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on societal views on disability and reproductive choices. If the husband's reasoning is based on not wanting the child to suffer and assuming that RP would lead to a worse quality of life, some might agree with him. However, if his stance stems from a belief that life with RP is not worth living, that's where ableism could come into play. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision based on their values, but there's a nuanced argument either way.\n"
