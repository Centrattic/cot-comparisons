      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe person and their wife are considering having a child. The wife has a family condition, Retina Pigmentosa, which affects the men in her family. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The author is conflicted because they don't want their child to miss out on life's joys, citing the grandfather's experience as an example. The author is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on potential future outcomes for their child. They're concerned about the quality of life the child might face. On the other hand, the condition is a known genetic risk, and the author is considering the implications of passing it on.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have a child with a genetic disorder that could severely impact their life is a complex one. Some argue that it's responsible to avoid knowingly putting a child in a difficult situation. Others might say that it's not for parents to decide the worth of a child's life, even with such challenges.\n\nThe author mentions they aren't trying to be offensive towards people with disabilities, which is important. Their concern seems to be about the child's quality of life. However, by choosing not to have a child who might inherit this condition, are they making a judgment that the child's life would be worse off? That's a point of contention.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions about their family planning, especially when it comes to genetic risks. But there's also the consideration of the child's autonomy. If the child could be born with a condition that leads to blindness, they might have a different perspective on their life's joys. The author's decision is based on their own values and what they consider an unacceptable risk.\n\nAnother angle is the possibility of support systems. The grandfather's experience is cited, but maybe with modern medicine, therapy, or assistive technologies, the child's life could be different. The author's concern is valid, but they're projecting their own fears onto the child's potential life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're making a choice based on their ethical beliefs and the potential suffering of the child, some might see it as responsible. However, others might argue that it's a form of ableism, implying that a life with a disability isn't worth living. The author clarifies they don't mean to offend, but the underlying assumption is that a life with blindness is deprived of \"joys.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are to protect the child, their reasoning might inadvertently devalue the quality of life for someone with a disability. The answer might depend on societal views on genetic conditions and autonomy.\n"
