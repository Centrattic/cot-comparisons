      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not wanting kids due to a hereditary condition is in the wrong. The situation involves Retinitis Pigmentosa, a condition that affects the family, particularly the men. The person is considering if they're an asshole for not wanting to have a son who might go blind in his 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. Retinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive vision loss. Since it's mentioned that it affects the men in the family, it's likely X-linked recessive. If the wife is a carrier, each son has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. The father, if he's not affected, would pass a Y chromosome to sons, so the sons would get their X chromosome from the mother. If the mother is a carrier, there's a 50% chance each son has the disease.\n\nThe person is worried about subjecting a child to a life where they might go blind, leading to a diminished quality of life. They mention their wife's father's experience, who is blind, has no job, etc. They don't want their child to have such a life. The question is if this is selfish or being an asshole.\n\nEthically, this involves personal values and the right to make reproductive choices. In many societies, individuals have the right to choose not to have children if they believe there's a high risk of serious genetic conditions. However, some might argue that it's playing God or that life is valuable regardless of disability. But the person isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities; they're concerned about the quality of life for their potential child.\n\nThe post also mentions that the person isn't trying to offend or be patronizing. They're making a personal decision based on their understanding of the risks. The key here is that it's their choice, and they're not forcing the child to have that life. They\u2019re considering the potential suffering and opting out of having a child with a high risk of a severe condition.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal decision based on their values and the potential suffering they want to avoid for their child.\n"
