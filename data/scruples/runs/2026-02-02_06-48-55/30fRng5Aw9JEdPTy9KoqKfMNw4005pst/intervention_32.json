      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa (RP) at age 20. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife has a family condition where the men in the family get RP, leading to blindness in their late 20s. The author is concerned about having a son who might go blind, leading to a life without the normal joys. He's asking if he's an a**hole for not wanting to put his child through that.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here is about reproductive choices and disability. The author is considering not having children to avoid passing on a genetic condition. But is that in the wrong?\n\nI remember that disability rights advocates often argue that people should not be seen as less valuable because of their disabilities. The idea of avoiding a child with a disability because of the challenges they might face can be controversial. It's a form of eugenics, which is a sensitive topic. On the other hand, the author is also considering the quality of life for the child and the family, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author clarifies that he's not trying to offend people with disabilities, which is a positive point. However, the underlying assumption is that a life with RP is not worth living, which can be problematic. It's possible that people with RP live fulfilling lives, and the author's perspective might be based on his own assumptions rather than the actual experiences of those affected.\n\nThe key issue here is whether it's ethical to choose not to have a child based on a genetic condition that may affect their future. Some might say it's the parents' right to make such decisions, while others argue it's discriminatory. The author's stance is about preventing suffering, but it's also about making a judgment about the value of a life with RP.\n\nIn disability rights circles, the concept of \"nothing about us without us\" is important. The author isn't engaging with the community of people who have RP to understand their perspectives. His decision is based on his own fears, which might not align with the reality of those living with the condition.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the disability rights perspective, he might be seen as making an ableist judgment by devaluing the life of someone with RP. However, from a personal choice standpoint, he's making a difficult decision about his family's future. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because it's about assuming a life with a disability is worse, which can be considered unethical.\n"
