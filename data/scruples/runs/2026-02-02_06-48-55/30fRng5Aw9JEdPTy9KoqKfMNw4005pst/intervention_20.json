      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about whether they're being an asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have a child who might go blind in their 20s due to a genetic condition. The author's wife has a family history of Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if it's wrong to not want to put their child through that, citing their wife's father's experience of being blind and not having a job or social life. They also mention they don't want to patronize or hurt anyone with disabilities and are using a throwaway account because their wife is lurking.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a decision based on their child's potential quality of life. On one hand, they're trying to avoid a life with significant challenges. On the other hand, it's someone else's life and the child's right to autonomy. But since the child isn't born yet, the parents are making a choice for them. However, genetic conditions can be complex, and the actual impact might vary. Also, the author is considering the family's well-being, not just the child's.\n\nThe condition in question affects males, so the author is a male, right? The wife's family history is a factor here. The author is concerned about the child's future, which is understandable. But is it right to decide not to have a child based on a potential genetic condition? Some might argue that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and the parents' assumptions about their child's life might be too pessimistic. Others might support the decision to avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nThe author also clarifies they're not trying to be offensive. They mention their wife's father's experience as a reason for their hesitation. However, each case is different. The father's experience doesn't necessarily predict the son's. Medical advancements could also change the prognosis. The 50% chance is a probabilistic risk, not a certainty. The parents are making a choice based on that risk.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate about the right to life versus the quality of life. Some ethical frameworks, like utilitarianism, might support avoiding bringing someone into a life with significant suffering. Others, like deontological ethics, might argue that it's wrong to decide another's life isn't worth living. There's also the aspect of disability rights, which might argue against assuming a child with a disability can't have a good life.\n\nThe author isn't discriminating against existing people but making a choice about procreation. It's a personal decision, but it's also influenced by their values and the potential future of the child. The question is whether avoiding the risk of a child with a condition that could lead to blindness is a reasonable decision or if it's being selfish or the \"asshole\" for not accepting the potential challenges.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a shift towards accepting and supporting people with disabilities, promoting the idea that they can have fulfilling lives. However, the author is considering the practical realities and their family's ability to deal with such a situation. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong answer. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the options, A is they are in the wrong, B is not.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's intent is to prevent their child from experiencing a life they perceive as difficult. They are not being malicious but are making a personal decision based on their values. However, some might argue that assuming a child's life would be worse without sight is problematic. On the other hand, others might see it as a responsible choice. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, I think it's a nuanced situation. But given the options, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal decision based on their values and concerns about future quality of life, even if others disagree.\n"
