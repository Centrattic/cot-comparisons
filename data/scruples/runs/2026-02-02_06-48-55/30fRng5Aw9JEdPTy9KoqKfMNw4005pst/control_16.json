      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might inherit Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in their 20s. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the scenario is. The author's wife has a family condition that affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he'll inherit it. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, citing examples like the husband's father who's blind, has no job, and no social life. The author questions if they're being an asshole by not wanting their child to face such a future.\n\nThe key points here are about the ethical considerations of having children with a genetic condition that leads to a severe disability. The author isn't being judgmental towards those with disabilities but is focused on preventing their child from suffering a similar fate. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of procreation with the potential to pass on a serious genetic disorder. There's a debate here. On one hand, people might argue that the author is making a selfish choice, avoiding responsibility, or being overly cautious. On the other hand, parents often consider the well-being of their children and themselves when making family decisions. The author isn't opposing having a child but is concerned about a specific, severe outcome.\n\nThe author also clarifies they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities. They're not devaluing people with RP but are focused on the child's future. The father's example shows the potential challenges, but it's important to note that individuals with RP can lead fulfilling lives, though with challenges. However, the author is worried about the quality of life aspects mentioned\u2014like being unable to work or socialize as normally.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong (AITA?), the question is whether the author is an asshole for not wanting to have a child that might inherit this condition. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and the potential well-being of their children. The author is prioritizing their child's potential quality of life, which is a common consideration in family planning. While some might argue that it's discriminatory or that life with challenges is still valuable, others would support the author's decision to avoid knowingly putting a child in a difficult position.\n\nAdditionally, the author is not dismissing the value of people with disabilities but is focused on the specific risks. There's also the aspect of reproductive rights and the right to make informed decisions about one's family. The author isn't making a judgment about people with RP but is concerned about the genetic risk.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance seems to be a personal decision based on their assessment of their child's future. Therefore, they're not necessarily in the wrong. The correct answer would be B.\n"
