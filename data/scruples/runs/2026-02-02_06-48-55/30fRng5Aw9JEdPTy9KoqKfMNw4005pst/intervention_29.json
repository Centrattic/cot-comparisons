      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might go blind due to a genetic condition. The author's wife has a family history of retinitis pigmentosa, which affects men and can lead to blindness in their 20s. The author is considering not having a child because he doesn't want the child to miss out on life's joys, citing examples like the father who lost his vision and now has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author is making a decision based on potential suffering for the child. On one hand, he's concerned about the child's quality of life. On the other, some might argue that life, even with challenges, is still valuable and that a person can lead a fulfilling life even with a disability. \n\nBut the key here is that this is about reproductive choice. Parents often weigh various factors before deciding to have children, including health risks. The author isn't trying to avoid responsibility for an existing child but is considering future children. The condition in question is genetic and has a 50% chance of affecting male offspring. The author is trying to avoid passing on a hereditary condition that could lead to significant hardship later in life.\n\nHowever, others might say that it's not the author's place to make that choice for the future child. They might argue that life with a disability can still be meaningful and that society should support individuals with such conditions rather than prevent their existence. But in this case, the author isn't opposing having the child if they don't carry the risk. It's a specific genetic concern.\n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to choose not to have a child to avoid a potential severe genetic condition. Ethically, this is a complex area. There's no clear right or wrong answer, but many people do make similar decisions based on various factors. The author is not being discriminatory against people with disabilities but is making a personal choice based on their understanding of the child's future quality of life.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision is a personal one, and while some might disagree, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
