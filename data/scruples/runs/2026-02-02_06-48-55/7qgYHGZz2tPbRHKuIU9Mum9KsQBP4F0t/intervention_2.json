It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation involves a group of friends who used to have monthly game nights, but the friend's girlfriend has been attending for four times and making it unpleasant for everyone else. The key points here are the group's discomfort, the girlfriend's behavior, and the author's plan to address it directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The group of friends originally had no problem with the girlfriend coming once, but her persistent presence and behavior are causing issues. The girlfriend is described as someone who dominates conversations, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable with her touchy-feely behavior, especially since the author is gay but not into \"girl talk.\" The group has discussed it but is unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only event.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group's right to set boundaries in their social gatherings is important. The author is trying to address a problem that's affecting their enjoyment. However, the approach\u2014telling the friend bluntly\u2014might be harsh. The question is whether the author's intention is valid or if they're being inconsiderate of their friend's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their time as they see fit. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly making it unenjoyable, so the author isn't wrong in wanting to address it. On the other hand, the friend's feelings for his girlfriend might be important, and the author should consider how to communicate this without damaging their friendship. However, the author isn't the one who's being rude; the girlfriend's actions are the problem. The author is trying to be tactful by suggesting a separate meetup for the couple.\n\nAnother angle: The author is part of a group that's collectively affected. They've tried being polite, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. So the author's plan to have a direct but kind conversation is a reasonable step. The alternative would be to let the situation continue, which isn't fair to the group. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they're trying to resolve a problem that's impacting their social time negatively.\n"
