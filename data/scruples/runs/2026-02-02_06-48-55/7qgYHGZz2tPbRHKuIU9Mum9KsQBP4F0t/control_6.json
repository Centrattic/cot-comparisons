It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group that has monthly game nights. One friend's girlfriend has been coming along for the last four times, and the group is really unhappy with her. The author wants to confront the friend about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being justified. The group doesn't like the girlfriend's presence because she's disruptive. She's talkative, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable with her behavior. The author and others have discussed it but don't know how to tell the friend. The author plans to be direct but nice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the group is in the wrong by wanting to exclude the girlfriend. The girlfriend isn't part of the original group, so maybe the group has the right to set boundaries. However, they should be careful not to be rude. The author's approach seems to be respectful by suggesting a guys-only night and maybe another get-together as a couple. \n\nBut wait, the problem is that the group is excluding someone without her consent. The boyfriend and girlfriend are a couple, so they might expect their presence to be considered. The group might have a right to their own space, but they should communicate this clearly. The author is planning to be upfront, which is better than being passive. \n\nHowever, is the author in the wrong? If they're being honest and respectful, then maybe not. The key is whether their approach is appropriate. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend directly but is addressing the group dynamic. The girlfriend's behavior is causing issues, so the group has valid reasons. \n\nBut there's a chance that the author's approach could hurt the friend's feelings. However, the alternative is letting the game night become unpleasant for everyone. The group needs to maintain their space. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a real issue respectfully. \n\nAnother angle: The author is part of a group that's been affected. They have a legitimate reason to want to exclude someone who's making their gatherings worse. The problem is that the friend might not see it the same way. But the author's method of communication is direct yet polite. So, the answer is B.\n"
