It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One of the friends' girlfriends has been attending the last four times and is making the gatherings unpleasant for everyone else. The author wants to tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The group originally included five friends, and the girlfriend's presence was initially okay but has become a problem. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's interruptive, self-centered, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to impose a stereotype. The group has discussed it and agrees they don't like her, but they're hesitant on how to approach their friend.\n\nThe author wants to confront the friend directly, suggesting they frame it as the group dynamic changing and making it a guys-only night. The question is whether this is the author being in the wrong.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the group give the girlfriend a chance? The initial attendance was okay, but over time issues arose. The author mentions they've tried to be tactful and even lied to her to set boundaries, which didn't work. The group has discussed it, so it's a collective decision, not just the author's. The method proposed is to be nice but clear, not attacking the girlfriend but adjusting the group's setup. \n\nPotential issues: The author is part of a group that's collectively making this decision. The intention is to preserve the group's comfort and original purpose. However, is it wrong to exclude someone based on their behavior? The girlfriend's actions are impacting the group's enjoyment and even making the author uncomfortable with the stereotype. The author isn't targeting the girlfriend; it's about the group's preferences. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Could it be seen as a betrayal to the friend by excluding his girlfriend? But the group is trying to communicate their feelings, not just act unilaterally. They're approaching it with the friend, not excluding him. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so the group has a legitimate reason. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often need to address issues. If the girlfriend's presence is making the event unenjoyable for everyone else, then the group has a right to set boundaries. The approach seems respectful\u2014suggesting a different arrangement rather than a harsh rejection. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue with a tactful approach, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
