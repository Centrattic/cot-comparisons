It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One of their friends brings his girlfriend four times, and she's making the group uncomfortable. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want her there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend is annoying, talks too much, interrupts others, and makes them uncomfortable because of her behavior. Additionally, the author is gay and feels that the girlfriend is trying to make him be a \"gay best friend,\" which he's not comfortable with. The group has discussed this and agrees she's not wanted, but they don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct but be nice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions. From an ethical standpoint, friends should be honest with each other. However, the way they approach it matters. The author's intention is to protect the group's comfort and maintain the game nights as they were. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly making the group uncomfortable, so it's not just about being mean but about setting boundaries.\n\nThe author is considering a respectful approach, not attacking the friend's girlfriend directly but explaining the dynamic change. The key here is whether it's wrong to ask a friend to not bring someone who's affecting the group negatively. In many cases, friends do need to communicate boundaries. The problem might be in how the author plans to say it, but the intent seems valid.\n\nHowever, another angle is that the author is part of a group that's excluding someone else's partner without a better solution. They might be avoiding the friend's feelings by not being more direct. But the question is about the author's rightness, not the friend's possible reaction. Since the group is unanimous and the author is trying to handle it respectfully, it's more about asserting their needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. The wrong would be if they were being rude or malicious, but the author is aiming to be polite and give an alternative (suggesting a different gathering for the couple). Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
