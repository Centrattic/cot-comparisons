It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like the girlfriend of one of their buddies coming to game nights. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's supposed to be a highlight for them. The girlfriend's presence has turned it into something unpleasant. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, and making things awkward for the author specifically, who is gay. The author tried being tactful but the girlfriend doesn't take hints. The friends have discussed it and all agree they don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the author wants to approach the friend directly. The question is whether this is wrong. On one hand, the group is being honest about their feelings. They have a right to set boundaries for their gathering. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting their enjoyment, so it's reasonable for them to address it. However, the method might matter. Approaching the friend directly, as the author suggests, might be harsh, but the intention is to maintain the group dynamic they all enjoy. \n\nBut wait, the author is part of the group that's been discussing this. They want to tell the friend that the group dynamic has changed and make it a guys-only night. The key here is whether the friends have a right to exclude someone. Since it's their group and their event, they can set the rules. However, the way they communicate it is important. The author's plan is to be nice but direct. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's boyfriend is part of the group, so including him but not his girlfriend might be a reasonable compromise. The author is considering a \"guys only\" night, which the boyfriend can attend with his girlfriend on a different occasion. That could be a fair solution. However, the problem is that the boyfriend's girlfriend's presence is causing issues, so excluding her might be necessary for the group's well-being.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to address this? If the friends are all on the same page and the girlfriend isn't welcome, then the author isn't wrong for speaking up. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it without being confrontational. The problem here is that the author is the one who wants to take the lead. The question is whether that's the right approach.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The friends have a right to set the tone of their gatherings. If the girlfriend's behavior is making it unbearable, then excluding her is a valid choice. The author's method is direct, but the intent is to restore the group's enjoyment. The main issue is that the author is taking the initiative to confront the friend, which could be seen as honest but maybe abrupt. However, given the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. The group's right to set boundaries outweighs the potential awkwardness of the conversation. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
