It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their friend's girlfriend has been coming to game night, and she's making it unpleasant. The author and their friends don't want her there anymore and are considering telling the friend directly.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The original game night was a group of five friends, and the girlfriend has been coming for four months. The author mentions that the group has discussed not liking her but doesn't want to confront the friend yet. The author wants to be direct, maybe a bit harsh, but also plans to be nice. The main issue is whether telling the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there is the right approach.\n\nPossible angles: 1) Is the author being honest about their feelings? 2) Do they have a right to exclude someone based on personal preferences? 3) Is there a better way to handle the situation? 4) Could this approach damage the friendship?\n\nThe author is concerned about the group dynamic. If the girlfriend is making the experience worse for everyone, maybe it's reasonable to address it. However, the way they plan to approach it is by telling the friend that the group wants it to be guys-only. The problem here might be that the author is making a broad statement without considering the friend's feelings. Also, the author admits that the group has talked about it, so maybe they should all be involved in the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about the issue, which is important. If the group is uncomfortable, they do have a right to set boundaries. But the method of communication is key. Telling the friend in a direct but kind way could be okay, but maybe the group should present a united front instead of just the author taking initiative.\n\nAnother point is the mention of the author being gay and the girlfriend's behavior towards them. That adds a personal element where the author feels disrespected. This might be a valid reason to feel uncomfortable, but the way they handle it could affect the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they are being honest and tactful, maybe not. But if they are excluding someone without giving the girlfriend a chance to change or if they're not being considerate of the friend's feelings, then maybe they are. The group has a right to their comfort, but they also need to communicate respectfully.\n\nI think the key here is whether their approach is fair and respectful. The author plans to be nice but is still being direct. The problem is that the group's decision to make it guys-only might be seen as excluding the girlfriend without her input. However, since the group doesn't want her there, it's their event, so they can set the rules. But they should do so in a way that's considerate of the friend's perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, but the method could be improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is about the approach being wrong, then maybe the answer is A. But if the right to set boundaries is considered right, then B. Hmm.\n"
