It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to join game night. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's become less enjoyable because the girlfriend is there. She's described as overly self-centered, interruptive, and making the author uncomfortable, especially regarding their sexuality. The author wants to directly confront their friend to make it a guys-only event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group's main issue is that the girlfriend's presence is affecting their enjoyment. The author mentions that they've all talked about it, so it's not just one person's opinion. The problem is that the girlfriend isn't getting hints, even after the author tried to be tactful. The author wants to be direct to resolve this, which they frame as \"ripping the bandaid off.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group's friends might have a right to their space and enjoyment. If the girlfriend's behavior is making the event unpleasant for everyone, it's reasonable to want to address it. However, the approach matters. The author is considering a direct confrontation, which could be seen as necessary if indirect methods have failed. \n\nBut there might be other factors. The girlfriend is a part of their friend's life, so excluding her might strain the friendship. The author should consider whether there's a more tactful way to approach this without being blunt. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior, especially regarding their sexuality, is valid. Being subjected to unwanted \"girl talk\" and physical touch is inappropriate, and the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's plan to tell the friend directly could be seen as honest, but maybe not the most considerate. The justification is that the group dynamic has changed and they want to focus on guys-only nights. However, the group's unanimous dislike of the girlfriend is a key point. If everyone agrees, then the author isn't acting alone but representing the group's sentiment. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Perhaps suggesting a separate gathering for couples instead of just excluding the girlfriend. The author's approach might come off as harsh, even if well-intentioned. However, since they've already tried to be polite without success, a direct approach might be warranted. \n\nIn terms of the author being \"in the wrong,\" it depends on the context. The group's right to their space versus the friend's right to include his girlfriend. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address it, but the method could be improved. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering the action. Since they've tried to be polite and the group is on board, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The key is that the group wants to set boundaries for their own enjoyment and has a valid reason to do so, despite the potential impact on the friendship. The author's intention is to restore their social space, which is a legitimate concern."
