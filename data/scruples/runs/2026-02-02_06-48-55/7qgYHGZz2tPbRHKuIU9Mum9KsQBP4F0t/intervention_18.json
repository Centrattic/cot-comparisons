It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One member's girlfriend has been attending for the last four times and is causing issues. The main points are: she's dominating conversations, interrupting, being loud, making the author uncomfortable with her touchy-feely behavior, and invading personal space by showing up uninvited at a gay bar.\n\nThe author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend at game night anymore. They plan to be nice and suggest a couple's night instead. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group initially agreed to let the girlfriend come, but now they find her presence problematic. The author is considering directly confronting the friend to change the arrangement. The key question is whether the author is justified in doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a shared event, and if her presence is making it uncomfortable for everyone, they have a right to address it. The author tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't getting hints. It's reasonable to want to preserve the group's dynamic. On the other hand, the approach of directly telling the friend could hurt his feelings, and maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the author is planning to be respectful and suggest an alternative.\n\nThe author isn't targeting the girlfriend directly but is addressing the friend, which is appropriate since the girlfriend is his partner. The group has discussed this, so it's a collective decision. The author's actions are to communicate the group's needs respectfully. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B.\n"
