It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a game night group where one friend's girlfriend is making the events unpleasant. The author, along with the other friends, wants to tell the boyfriend that they don't want the girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group used to enjoy game nights, but the girlfriend's presence has changed that. She's described as attention-seeking, interruptive, and making the author uncomfortable with her touchy-feely behavior and trying to make the author conform to a stereotype. The other friends agree they don't like her but are unsure how to tell the boyfriend. The author wants to be direct but polite, suggesting a separate couples' night instead.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why might that be? Maybe because they're being exclusionary or not handling it tactfully. However, the group has discussed this and all agree they don't want her there. The author is just trying to communicate this to the boyfriend. It's important to consider if the author is being fair. The girlfriend is causing discomfort, and the author's approach is to have a one-on-one conversation with the boyfriend to explain the group's feelings. The author isn't attacking the boyfriend but suggesting a solution that respects his relationship by proposing a different gathering.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is wrong to exclude her without giving her a chance to improve. But the group has tried being tactful, and the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The author's plan is to be honest but kind. Also, the group is trying to maintain their own social space. They have the right to set boundaries for their gatherings. The issue is whether excluding her is justified given her behavior. Since the group is consistent in their dislike and the author's approach is respectful, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a group that's collectively making this decision. The author isn't acting alone but is following the group's consensus. The problem is about maintaining the group's comfort and original purpose of the game night. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to preserve their social environment and are handling it in a considerate way.\n"
