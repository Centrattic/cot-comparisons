It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong if they tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been attending the last four times. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable, especially because the author is gay and the girlfriend is pressuring them into a \"gay best friend\" role. The group has discussed it and all agree she's uninviting, but they don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key points here are the group's collective opinion versus individual actions. The group has all talked about it, so it's not just the author's personal dislike. The author wants to be honest but tactful. However, confronting a friend about their partner can be sensitive. The author mentions being \"nice about it\" and framing it as a change in group dynamics rather than a personal attack.\n\nBut there are potential issues. Even if the group agrees, telling the friend directly might hurt his feelings. The girlfriend's behavior is a problem, but the solution is to exclude her, which could strain the friendship. The author is taking the initiative, but maybe the group should collectively approach the friend instead of one person doing it. Also, the author's personal issues with the girlfriend (like the gay bar incident) might add extra tension. However, the author tried to be tactful before, and the group discussed it, so there's some consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment, and they have the right to set boundaries for their social gatherings. The author isn't doing it out of malice but to maintain group dynamics. The approach is to be honest but respectful, which is important.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're addressing a group problem that's been discussed. On the other, confronting the friend directly could be seen as harsh. However, since the group is on board, and the author is planning to be respectful, maybe it's justified. The answer might be B (No), because the group's collective decision to set boundaries is reasonable, and the author is acting on behalf of the group's consensus. The key is that they're not being cruel but trying to maintain their social space.\n"
