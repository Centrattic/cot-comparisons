It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe setup is that the author and their friends have a monthly game night, which used to be fun but has become unpleasant since one friend's girlfriend started coming. The girlfriend is described as very attention-seeking, interrupting others, not interesting, and making the experience awkward. Plus, there's an issue with her treating the author, who is gay, inappropriately by trying to make him act like a \"gay BFF\" and invading his personal space. The author and others don't want to hurt their friend's feelings, but the author wants to just be direct and have a guy's night instead.\n\nFirst, the author is considering telling the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Are the friends justified in their dislike? The girlfriend's behavior sounds pretty abrasive\u2014constantly talking, interrupting, being loud. If she's making the event unenjoyable for everyone except her boyfriend, maybe it's reasonable to ask her not to come. But how to approach it without causing harm to the friend's relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that they've tried to be tactful, even lied to avoid her. But she doesn't get the hint. So maybe direct communication is necessary. The author plans to be nice, suggesting a different arrangement. But is there a better way? Maybe the group should talk to the friend together, rather than one person taking the lead. However, the scenario says they've all talked about it and are unsure how to approach it. The author wants to take action.\n\nIs there a duty to be more private or to handle it behind the friend's back? The author wants to be honest and open, which could be the right approach. But there's a risk of damaging the friendship if the friend feels betrayed. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior is valid, especially regarding the gender-specific harassment as a gay man. That's a serious issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for discomfort and the group's collective dissatisfaction. The approach could be improved\u2014maybe involving the entire group in the conversation with the friend\u2014but the intent is to restore the group's enjoyment, which is reasonable. The answer would be B (No).\n"
