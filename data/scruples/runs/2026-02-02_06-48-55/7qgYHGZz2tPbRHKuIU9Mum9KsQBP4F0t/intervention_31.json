It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. The situation is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been attending for the last four times, making the gatherings unpleasant for everyone else. The author mentions that the girlfriend is very self-centered, interrupts conversations, and makes the author uncomfortable because of her behavior, including touching and trying to make him fit a gay stereotype. The group has discussed it and agrees they don't want her there, but they're unsure how to tell their friend.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to approach their friend directly and tell him that the group is going to make it a guys-only event. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group is a close-knit group of five friends. The friend's girlfriend's presence is causing issues for everyone. The author mentions that the group has talked about it and all agree they don't want her there. The main concerns are the girlfriend's behavior affecting the group dynamic and the author's personal discomfort due to her actions towards him as a gay man.\n\nThe author's plan is to approach the friend directly in a nice way, explaining that the group dynamic changed and suggest a separate gathering for the couple. The key points here are whether it's appropriate to exclude someone based on the group's preferences, and if the approach is respectful.\n\nOn one hand, the group has the right to set their own boundaries and rules for their gatherings. If the presence of someone is causing discomfort and ruining the experience, it's understandable they might want to address it. The author is trying to be tactful by suggesting an alternative meeting. However, the girlfriend is part of a friend's relationship, so there's a social obligation to handle this carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the method of communication is important. The author plans to be direct but kind, which is a reasonable approach. However, the group's consensus is that they all agree, which might mean the friend could feel blindsided if he wasn't previously aware of the group's feelings. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is described as problematic, but the group's decision to exclude her entirely might be seen as harsh if the friend is unaware of the extent of the issues.\n\nAnother angle is whether the group should have addressed the behavior first before deciding to exclude her. For example, maybe they could have given the girlfriend feedback about her behavior and given her a chance to change. But the author mentions that they've tried to be tactful and that she doesn't get the hint. The author even lied about not having female friends to avoid her touchiness, which suggests that the group's attempts to address the issue have been ineffective.\n\nThe ethical consideration here is balancing the group's right to their own social space with the friend's right to attend with his girlfriend. If the group's primary goal is to have a comfortable environment for themselves, they have the right to establish that. However, they need to communicate this in a way that respects the friend's relationship and feelings. The author's plan to talk to the friend directly and offer an alternative seems like a responsible approach, rather than excluding her without explanation.\n\nBut there's also the potential for hurt feelings and the impact on the friend's relationship. The author should consider that the friend might defend his girlfriend or feel that the group is being unfair. However, if the group has genuinely discussed this and agreed, and the author is being honest and respectful in the conversation, it might be justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method could be considered harsh, the situation involves a group of friends who are uncomfortable with the girlfriend's presence and have tried to address it without success. The author's intent is to restore the group's enjoyment of their own event, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, one could argue that the approach could be more sensitive or that the group should have given the girlfriend more chances to adjust her behavior. But given the repeated issues and the group's consensus, their decision to exclude her is understandable.\n"
