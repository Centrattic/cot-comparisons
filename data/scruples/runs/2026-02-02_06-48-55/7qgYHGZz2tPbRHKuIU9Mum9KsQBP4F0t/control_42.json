It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their group of friends have a monthly game night, which used to be their highlight. One friend's girlfriend has been joining the past four times. Initially, they were okay with it, but she's making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as annoying, always trying to be the center of attention, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push gay stereotypes on him. The group has discussed it and none of them like her, but they don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and have a conversation with the friend to make game night guys-only again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, considering the facts, the author's intention is to address a problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive, and the group is unhappy. The author wants to be honest but polite, explaining that the dynamic has changed and suggest a different arrangement. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the group is the one who's collectively unhappy. The author is advocating for the group's preferences. However, they need to be careful not to be rude or hurtful. The proposed approach seems respectful: having a private conversation with the friend, being honest but not blaming him, and offering an alternative (couple's night). That seems reasonable. The author isn't trying to attack the friend's girlfriend personally but is focusing on the group dynamic. \n\nHowever, there's a risk here. The author is assuming that the entire group is on the same page. The question states that \"we just don't know how to tell him,\" implying maybe they haven't all agreed on the approach. Also, the author is considering taking the lead without ensuring the group is fully aligned. But the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, which is affecting the group's experience. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect the group's enjoyment and their own comfort. Since the group has discussed it and they all agree, the author's approach is justified. The key is whether the method is appropriate. The author plans to be nice and honest, which is a valid way to handle it. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a legitimate concern in a respectful manner, trying to preserve the group's dynamic and their own well-being. The problem isn't with the author's intention but with how the friend reacts. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to solve a problem that the group has.\n"
