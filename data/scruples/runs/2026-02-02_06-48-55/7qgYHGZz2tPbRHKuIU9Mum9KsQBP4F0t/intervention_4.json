It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author and their friends have a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend keeps coming, making it unpleasant. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The group is close-knit, and the girlfriend's presence has made the game nights less enjoyable. The author mentions that she's loud, self-centered, and even makes uncomfortable assumptions about the author's sexuality. They've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The friends have discussed it and agree she's not welcome, but they're unsure how to tell her partner.\n\nThe author's plan is to have a straightforward conversation with the friend, being nice but clear. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is it fair to exclude someone from a social event if they're causing discomfort? The group has a right to enjoy their own gatherings without feeling forced to accommodate someone who's making them uncomfortable. However, the approach matters. The author is trying to be respectful by suggesting an alternative (a couples night), so maybe that's a valid way to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior might be problematic, but the author's friends might not have directly addressed her. The author's friend's girlfriend isn't directly involved in the conversation yet. The author is in a position of relaying their friends' feelings to the partner, which could be seen as a responsible action to protect the group dynamic. However, there's a risk of hurting the friend if the message isn't delivered carefully. The key factors here are intent and method. The author's intent is to preserve the group's enjoyment, which is understandable. The method is direct but aims to be kind. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their approach is considered reasonable. Since the group has discussed it and the author is trying to handle it respectfully, maybe the answer is no. But perhaps there's a better way, like having the friend talk to his girlfriend first. However, the friend might not be aware of the problem if his girlfriend isn't taking hints. In that case, the author's role is to communicate the group's needs. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that affects their group's enjoyment, and they're doing it in a considerate way. The answer should be B.\n"
