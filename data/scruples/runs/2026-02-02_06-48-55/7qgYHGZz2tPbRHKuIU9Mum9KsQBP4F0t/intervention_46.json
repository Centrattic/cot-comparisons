It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has monthly game nights, which used to be fun, but the friend's girlfriend has been coming four times. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and even making personal comments about the author's sexuality, which is making the author uncomfortable. The group all agrees they don't like her presence but are unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making game nights guys only.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group is the one who initially allowed the girlfriend to come. The friend might have expected his partner to be included in their social activities. Also, the author is part of a group that's collectively unhappy, so maybe they have a right to set boundaries. However, the approach of confronting the friend directly could be seen as honest communication rather than being in the wrong. \n\nBut there's another angle. The author is a friend of the boyfriend, so perhaps they should respect his relationship and not exclude his girlfriend without consulting him. The girlfriend might not be aware of the group's discomfort, and the author is taking it upon themselves to address it. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior is valid, but maybe the solution is to talk to the boyfriend first in a kinder way before deciding to make it a guys-only event. \n\nHowever, the group has discussed it and all agree. The author is suggesting a direct but polite approach. The problem is that the girlfriend's presence is ruining the event for everyone except the boyfriend. In such cases, friends have the right to set boundaries for their own gatherings. So maybe the author is justified in wanting to address it. \n\nBut there's also the issue of the author's personal issues with the girlfriend, like the \"gay bff\" comments. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the whole group. But the group has all agreed, so it's not just the author's opinion. \n\nI think the key here is that the group is the one who's collectively decided they don't want her there. The author is just the one taking the initiative to communicate it. If they do it respectfully, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the group should consider if excluding the girlfriend is fair, given that the boyfriend might see it as important for her to be included. The author's approach needs to be tactful, but the desire to set boundaries isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the group has the right to set boundaries for their own events. However, some might argue that the author is being inconsiderate of the boyfriend's feelings. But since the group is united, and the author is just the one speaking up, it's more about respecting the group's collective decision. Therefore, I lean towards B.\n"
