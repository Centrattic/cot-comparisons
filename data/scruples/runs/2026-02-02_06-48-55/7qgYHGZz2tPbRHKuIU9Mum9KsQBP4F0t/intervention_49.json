It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For...) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a monthly game night with four friends. One of the friends brought his girlfriend four times, and now the group is unhappy. The girlfriend is described as very self-centered, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable, especially since he's gay and she's trying to push him into a \"gay BFF\" role. The group has discussed it and doesn't want her there anymore. The author wants to confront their friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the girlfriend's behavior is making the group uncomfortable, the author has tried to be tactful, and the group has already discussed it. The author wants to communicate that the group dynamics have changed and make it guys-only. \n\nIs the author wrong to confront their friend? Well, the group has already talked about it, so they're not acting alone. The author's intention is to be direct but kind. However, the approach might be harsh, depending on how it's delivered. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the method is the best.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so the author has a legitimate reason. The issue is whether it's appropriate to exclude someone based on the group's preferences. The author is part of the group, so it's their social circle. They have the right to set boundaries. However, how they communicate it matters. The author plans to be nice, so maybe it's fair. \n\nBut maybe the author should have included the friend in the discussion earlier, rather than waiting until now. Also, calling the friend's girlfriend annoying and changing the dynamic could be seen as valid reasons. \n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the usual advice is to be honest but kind. The author is considering that approach. The problem might be that the friend might feel blindsided, but since the group has discussed it, maybe it's okay. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that's affecting the group's enjoyment. They have a right to set boundaries in their social group. However, the way they handle the conversation is important. If they're respectful and considerate, it's justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
