It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which is a guys-only thing. One friend's girlfriend has joined four times, and the others find her annoying. She's described as self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" role. The group has discussed it but hasn't told the friend yet. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The friends are all in agreement that they don't want her there. The girlfriend's behavior is making the group uncomfortable, and the author is trying to be tactful. But is it wrong to tell the friend?\n\nOn one hand, the group has a shared space, and they should have the right to set boundaries. The author is trying to be respectful by addressing it rather than letting it continue. The girlfriend isn't part of the group, so maybe it's reasonable to ask her not to come. However, the approach matters. The author plans to be direct but kind, which is a mature way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might take it personally, thinking the group doesn't like his girlfriend, which could strain their friendship. But the group's comfort is also valid. They have the right to maintain their space. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend directly but explaining the group dynamic change. That seems fair.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior is objectively problematic\u2014interrupting, being self-centered, making someone uncomfortable. The group isn't wrong to want to address it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend. They're being honest and trying to preserve the group's dynamic. The answer should be B.\n"
