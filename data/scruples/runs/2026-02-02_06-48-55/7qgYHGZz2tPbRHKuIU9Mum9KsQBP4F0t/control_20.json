It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group of friends has regular game nights. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times and is causing issues. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and making the others uncomfortable, especially the author who is gay and feels she's trying to stereotype him. The group has talked about it and doesn't like her, but they're unsure how to approach the friend. The author wants to be straightforward and tell him they want to keep it guys-only.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the group is made up of friends who are all on the same page. The girlfriend's presence is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone. The author is trying to be polite and tactful, suggesting a separate night for the couple. The group isn't trying to be malicious; they just want to enjoy their time without discomfort. Also, the author is being upfront about it, which might be the right approach to avoid ongoing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's girlfriend is coming as part of his relationship. The group is excluding her without her boyfriend's knowledge, which might be seen as being rude to him. The author's friend might feel hurt or betrayed if the group suddenly stops including his girlfriend. Plus, there's the aspect of the author's personal issues with the girlfriend, like the touching and \"girl talk,\" which could be personal and maybe not the group's main concern. Also, the author's lie about not having female friends could be a problem, but that's more about their approach than the main issue.\n\nBut the key points are that the group is collectively in agreement, they've tried being polite, and the situation is affecting their enjoyment. The author's intention is to maintain the group dynamic, which is understandable. They're not targeting the girlfriend personally but the situation where her presence is causing issues. So, while it's a sensitive situation, the group isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to address it. They are being honest but respectful, which is a valid approach.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a problem that affects the group's enjoyment and have a thoughtful way of communicating it.\n"
