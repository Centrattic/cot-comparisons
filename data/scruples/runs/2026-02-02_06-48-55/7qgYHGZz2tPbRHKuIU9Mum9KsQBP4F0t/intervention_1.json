It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's girlfriend joining their game night, and the group finding her annoying. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group used to enjoy game night, but with the girlfriend's presence, it's become unpleasant. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making personal comments about the author, who is gay. The author and friends have discussed this and want to tell the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group's right to enjoy their time is important. They should be able to set boundaries if someone is making them uncomfortable. The author is trying to address a problem that's affecting their social experience. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so it's not just about not liking her but about the way she's behaving.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach matters. The author wants to be direct but kind. However, they might be considering cutting the friend's partner out without the friend's consent. The friend might value the girlfriend's inclusion, so the author's action could hurt the friend. But the group's discomfort is valid, especially if the girlfriend is being disruptive.\n\nI need to weigh the friend's feelings against the group's well-being. If the girlfriend is making the group miserable, then the group has a right to address it. However, the method of confrontation is crucial. The author's plan is to be polite and offer an alternative. That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the girlfriend's behavior is not just about being there but also making the author uncomfortable with her actions, like the gay bar incident. That adds another layer of personal discomfort. So, it's not just about group dynamics but individual respect and boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to exclude someone who's causing issues? If the group has discussed it and the person is genuinely causing problems, then it's reasonable to set boundaries. The key is whether the author is being fair and respectful in their approach. The author's intention is to be kind, which is positive.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it without cutting someone out entirely. Could they talk to the friend first and see if he's aware or if there's a middle ground? However, the group has already tried being tactful and the friend's girlfriend isn't responding. So, maybe the direct approach is necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate problem that affects the group's enjoyment and personal comfort. The approach is direct but polite, which is appropriate in such situations.\n"
