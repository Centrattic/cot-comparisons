It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) and their group of friends have a monthly game night. One of their friends has a girlfriend who's been coming along for the past four times. The author and the rest of the group find her annoying and uncomfortable, especially because she's always the center of attention and there's also an issue with the author being gay and the girlfriend making him uncomfortable with touchy-feely behavior and trying to push him into a \"gay BFF\" role. The author wants to tell their buddy that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group initially didn't mind when the girlfriend first came, but over time, her behavior has made the game nights unpleasant. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and be honest but kind.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend? Let's think. The key points are about the group's comfort and the right to have social gatherings without being uncomfortable. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment and even making someone feel harassed in a way (the author's experience). The author is trying to address this by being honest with the friend, which could be seen as necessary for the group's well-being.\n\nBut is it appropriate to exclude someone from a social event? If the group's intent was always to be a guys-only get-together, but they allowed the girlfriend to come at first, maybe there was an initial openness. However, when the situation becomes consistently uncomfortable, the group has a right to adjust the dynamics. The problem is whether the author's approach is the right way to do it. The author plans to be respectful and suggest an alternative (like a couple's night), so maybe that's reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking a stance against the friend's girlfriend, which could strain the friendship. But the friend might not be aware of how his girlfriend's actions are affecting the group. The author's intent is to protect the group's environment and their own well-being. \n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest and direct, which is sometimes necessary in social situations. If the friend's girlfriend is making others uncomfortable and not heeding hints, the group has the right to set boundaries. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend personally but explaining that the dynamic has changed. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have tried more subtle approaches first? But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing this direct approach. Given that the group has already discussed it and everyone agrees, the author's plan to communicate this might be justified. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the group's right to their social space vs. the friend's relationship. The author isn't being malicious, but is being honest about the group's preferences. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
