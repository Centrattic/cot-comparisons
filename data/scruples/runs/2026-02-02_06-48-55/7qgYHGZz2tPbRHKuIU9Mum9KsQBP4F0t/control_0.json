It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the game night is a monthly event for five friends. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times now, and the group has grown unhappy with her presence. The writer is gay, and the girlfriend has been making him uncomfortable with her behavior, even going so far as to invade his personal space and show up uninvited at a gay bar. The rest of the group also agrees they don't like her there but aren't sure how to tell the friend. The writer wants to be direct but nice about it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are consent and respect. The group initially didn't mind when the girlfriend was invited, but now they're all uncomfortable. They've talked about it among themselves. The writer is trying to address a problem that affects everyone. The girlfriend's behavior is making the game night unpleasant for all, and the writer is considering a tactful approach to address this. \n\nIn social groups, boundaries are important. If someone's partner is affecting the group's enjoyment, it's reasonable to address it. The writer is not being malicious; they're trying to restore the original dynamic of the group. The main issue is whether the approach is respectful. The suggested method is to have a one-on-one conversation with the friend to change the group dynamic, which is a common way to handle such situations. \n\nHowever, there might be a better way to handle it, like involving the friend's girlfriend directly if possible, but the writer is choosing to speak to the friend first, which is a standard approach when dealing with a partner's behavior. The writer is not spreading rumors or being cruel; they're addressing a genuine issue that affects the group. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
