It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has monthly game nights, which were initially fun but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started attending. The author describes her as annoying, domineering, and making things awkward, especially since the author is gay and she's trying to push him into a \"gay BFF\" role. The group has discussed this and wants to tell the friend, but they don't know how. The author plans to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, considering the options. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nPros of the author's action: They're being direct and honest. The group is uncomfortable, and it's affecting their enjoyment. Telling the friend upfront might prevent ongoing issues. The author is trying to be tactful with the wording.\n\nCons: The girlfriend isn't part of the group, so it's possible the friend might not see it coming. The author is making a judgment about someone else's relationship. Even if the group feels uncomfortable, there's a risk of hurting the friend or the girlfriend. Also, the author's personal issues with the girlfriend (like the gay BFF situation) might add to the tension but could be a sensitive part of the conversation.\n\nEthically, group dynamics are important. If the group is the main social activity for the author and others, they have a right to feel that their space is being disrupted. However, the way they approach it matters. Being direct might be necessary, but how they phrase it and whether they consider the friend's feelings could affect the outcome.\n\nAlso, the author's personal grievances (with the girlfriend's behavior and the \"gay BFF\" issue) might be part of why they feel strongly. But the group's collective discomfort is valid. They might be justified in wanting to protect their space.\n\nBut is it the author's place to confront the friend? Maybe. The group is supposed to be a social space for them. They have a right to set boundaries. However, it's possible that the friend might feel betrayed or that the group is being exclusionary. The approach needs to be respectful and considerate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to address a real issue affecting the group's enjoyment. While the method might be direct, the intention is to restore the group's dynamic. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there aren't any other factors. The author is being honest, albeit blunt, and the group's discomfort is genuine. So, probably B.\n"
