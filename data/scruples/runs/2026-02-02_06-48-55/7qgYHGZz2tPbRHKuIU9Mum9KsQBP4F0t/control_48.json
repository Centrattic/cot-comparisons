It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's been a highlight for the author. The friend's girlfriend has come four times, which the group initially didn't mind, but now she's making the events unpleasant. She's very self-centered, interrupting others, and the author is gay, but the girlfriend tries to push him into a \"gay BFF\" stereotype with unwanted behavior. The group has discussed not liking her presence and wants to tell the friend to make it guys-only.\n\nThe author's plan is to be direct but nice, suggesting a different arrangement for the couple. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says yes, the author is wrong; B says no. \n\nI should evaluate the ethics here. The group is collectively unhappy with the girlfriend's presence, and they've discussed it. The author is planning to communicate this to the friend. The key points are whether the group has a right to set boundaries and if the author's approach is respectful.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is problematic\u2014dominating conversations, interrupting, being loud, and making the author uncomfortable with her actions. The group isn't targeting the friend but the girlfriend's behavior. The author's approach is to be straightforward but polite, which seems reasonable given the situation. \n\nHowever, is it wrong to exclude someone from a social group because of their behavior? The group has the right to set their own boundaries, especially if the environment becomes toxic. The author is acting in the group's interest, not just their own. \n\nBut maybe they should have tried to give the girlfriend more chances or address her behavior first? The author mentions they've already been tactful and the girlfriend didn't take hints. So, the group might feel they've done enough and now need to set clear boundaries. \n\nAnother angle: is the author overstepping by being the one to confront the friend? But the group has discussed it, so the author isn't acting alone. The plan is to be kind and suggest an alternative. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about respecting the group's need for their space to remain enjoyable. The author isn't being malicious but is trying to address a real issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B.\n"
