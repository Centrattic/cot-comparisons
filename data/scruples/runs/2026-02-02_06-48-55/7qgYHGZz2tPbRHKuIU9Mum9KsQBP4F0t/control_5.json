It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend's girlfriend is making game nights unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author and the group want to tell the friend that they don't want the girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's approach is justified. The group has talked about it and the girlfriend's behavior is affecting their enjoyment. She's interrupting others, being inconsiderate, and making personal comments that make the author uncomfortable. The author is going to confront the friend directly but in a nice way, suggesting making it a guys-only night.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their time together. If the girlfriend is making it unenjoyable, it's reasonable to set boundaries. They tried being polite and giving hints, but the girlfriend isn't taking them. The author's approach is direct but respectful, not confrontational. The key point is that they're addressing the friend, not the girlfriend, and proposing an alternative. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that approaching it this way could hurt the friend's feelings or damage the friendship. However, the author mentions being nice and not confrontational. Also, the group as a whole has discussed it, so it's not just one person's opinion. The friend might not realize how his girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms around social groups and relationships. Friends often adjust group dynamics when necessary. It's not uncommon to have exclusive events, especially if the presence of someone else negatively impacts the group. The author isn't being hostile; he's trying to maintain the group's enjoyment while respecting the friend's relationship. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting to communicate this issue. Since the group has already discussed it and tried to hint, the direct approach is a reasonable next step. The answer here would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for the group's comfort and seeking a solution.\n"
