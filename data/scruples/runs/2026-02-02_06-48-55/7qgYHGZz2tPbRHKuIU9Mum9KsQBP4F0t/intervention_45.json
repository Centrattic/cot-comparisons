It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like the girlfriend joining their game nights. The author wants to tell their buddy that the group prefers it to be guys-only now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friends have discussed it and don't like the girlfriend, but they haven't communicated this to the buddy. The author wants to be direct and tell him. The girlfriend's behavior is described as annoying and intrusive, and there's also a personal issue where she's making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the buddy? Well, the group has already talked about it but hasn't addressed it with the friend. The author is trying to be honest and set boundaries. The friend's girlfriend is affecting their enjoyment and making the author uncomfortable. The approach the author plans to take is to be polite and suggest a different arrangement. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have first tried to talk to the buddy privately before considering excluding his girlfriend. The buddy might not be aware of how his girlfriend is affecting the group. By going straight to telling the buddy, the author might come across as confrontational without giving him a chance to address the issue himself. \n\nBut the friends have already talked about it and decided they don't want her there. The author is seeking a way to communicate that to the buddy. The alternative is excluding her without telling the friend, which could damage trust. So being honest is probably the better approach. The key is whether the author is wrong for wanting to communicate the group's feelings directly. \n\nIn terms of the author's specific actions, if they approach it respectfully and with the intention to preserve the friendship while setting boundaries, it's justified. The author isn't being malicious but rather trying to maintain their social group's dynamics and their own comfort. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing a valid issue and handling it with a plan to be respectful.\n"
