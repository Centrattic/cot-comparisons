It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for wanting to tell his friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group has a monthly game night with five friends. The friend's girlfriend has come four times and made the gatherings unpleasant for everyone else. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to force a gay best friend stereotype on him. The author and others don't like her, but they're struggling to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct but nice, suggesting a guys-only night and a separate couples meet-up.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider:\n\n1. **Intent vs. Tact**: The author wants to address the problem but is considering a direct approach. Is that wrong? If the group is genuinely uncomfortable and the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the dynamic, the intent is to restore their original social setup. However, the method might be hurtful even if well-intended.\n\n2. **Respecting the Friend's Relationship**: The friend's girlfriend is part of his life. By excluding her without his consent, does the group risk hurting his feelings or overstepping? The author acknowledges they've talked about it but haven't acted yet. Maybe a more tactful approach is needed, like discussing the issue collectively and privately first.\n\n3. **Impact on All Involved**: The author is gay and feels targeted by the girlfriend's actions. That's a valid personal boundary. If the girlfriend is making him uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address it. However, the way to communicate that might matter.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions**: Could there be a compromise? For example, inviting the girlfriend but setting boundaries for respectful conversation, or having a separate event with the couple. The author's plan is to have a couples night instead, which could work if communicated kindly.\n\n5. **Potential for Conflict**: If the author goes alone, the friend might feel blamed. Group discussion might be better. Also, the friend might not realize his girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so the approach needs to be non-confrontational.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to address the issue, but the method might be. The wrong approach could be if they're not considering the friend's perspective or not handling it sensitively. However, since the group has discussed it and the behavior is affecting their enjoyment, the author's stance is understandable. The key is whether the method of communication is appropriate. The answer depends on whether being direct without prior collective discussion is wrong. Since the post mentions they've all talked about it but haven't acted, the author's plan to take the friend out for a beer and be nice might be okay, but perhaps could be improved by involving the group in the conversation first. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the behavior is genuinely unwelcome and affecting the group, then the author isn't wrong in wanting to address it. So, answer B (No).\n"
