It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The group has a monthly game night which used to be a highlight. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, making the events unpleasant. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and even making the author uncomfortable with her behavior, especially since the author is gay and she's trying to push a \"gay BFF\" stereotype. The group has talked about it and agrees she's not welcomed, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to just come out with it directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the group is the one who originally allowed her to join. The friend asked if she could come, and they didn't mind at first. But over time, her presence became problematic. The group's feelings are valid\u2014they have the right to enjoy their time together. However, directly confronting the friend about his girlfriend might be hurtful. The friend might feel betrayed, and the author might be overstepping by not finding a more tactful approach. The author's approach is honest but could damage the friendship if not handled carefully.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've tried to be tactful and even lied to avoid the situation. But the friend's girlfriend isn't taking hints. The group's consensus is that she's not wanted. In that case, the author's intention is to preserve the group's dynamic. However, the method of delivery might be the issue. The author is being direct, which is honest but possibly harsh. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, they are standing up for the group's needs. However, the way they're doing it could be more considerate. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, but maybe the approach could be better. However, the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering that the group has discussed it and the friend's behavior is affecting their enjoyment, the author is not wrong for wanting to speak up. The real issue might be the delivery, but the act of addressing it isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
