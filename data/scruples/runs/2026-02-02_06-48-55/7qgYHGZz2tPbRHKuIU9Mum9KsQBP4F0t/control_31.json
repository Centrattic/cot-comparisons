It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night. The situation is that the girlfriend is causing discomfort for the group. The author and their friends all agree she's making the game nights unpleasant. The author plans to confront the friend directly.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points are that the girlfriend is being disruptive\u2014dominating conversations, interrupting, and making personal comments towards the author, who is gay. The group has discussed it and doesn't want her there anymore. The author wants to have a honest conversation with the friend to change it to a guys-only night.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. The author is trying to address a problem that affects the group's enjoyment. They're not being malicious; they want to maintain their usual activity. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is causing discomfort. The author is considering a direct approach, which is mature because they're not gossiping or excluding the friend. They're also planning to suggest an alternative, which is fair.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The author is making a group decision without consulting the friend. Is it right to collectively decide that someone should be excluded? The friend might feel that his partner's inclusion is important. However, the group is the original organizers, and they have a right to set boundaries for their own gatherings. The author isn't doing this out of spite but because the dynamic has changed and their usual enjoyment is affected.\n\nAlso, the author is being considerate by planning to be nice and offer an alternative. They've tried to be tactful before, but the girlfriend didn't get the hint. The author has a right to protect their social space, especially if the girlfriend's actions are making others uncomfortable. The situation is affecting the entire group, so collective action is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given the friend more time to address the behavior with his girlfriend. However, the group has already tried being polite, and the girlfriend isn't responding. The author's approach is direct but respectful. There's no indication of malice, just a desire to restore the original purpose of game night.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue affecting the group. The answer should be B.\n"
