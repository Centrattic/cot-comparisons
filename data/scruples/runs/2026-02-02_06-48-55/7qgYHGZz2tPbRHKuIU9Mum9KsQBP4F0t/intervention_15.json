It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario) is in the wrong for planning to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game nights. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend group used to have game nights without the girlfriend, but she's been coming for the last four times. The group finds her annoying\u2014she's loud, dominating conversations, and the author is uncomfortable with her trying to make them act more feminine. The group has talked about it and all agree they don't like her there. The author wants to confront their friend directly but in a nice way, suggesting a guys-only night.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the group has a right to their comfort and the original dynamic of their game night. They've tried being tactful, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. The author is considering a direct but respectful approach. On the other hand, ending the friendship with the friend might be an unintended consequence, and the friend might feel betrayed. Also, the author's personal issues (like the gay bar incident) might be more personal and not directly related to the group dynamic.\n\nBut the key points are that the group has discussed it and all feel the same. The author is being honest and upfront, which is better than being passive-aggressive. The intention is to preserve the group's dynamic, not to be malicious. However, the way it's handled is crucial. If done respectfully, maybe the friend can understand. The alternative is letting the situation continue, which is causing discomfort for everyone.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they approach it respectfully, I think they're justified in protecting the group's environment. But if their approach is harsh or dismissive, that's different. The scenario describes being \"nice about it,\" so it's more about honesty than cruelty. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but I need to assess based on the details. The main issue is whether it's fair to exclude the girlfriend without the friend's knowledge. But since the group is addressing it with the friend, it's more about communication than exclusion. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it directly and respectfully.\n"
