It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't want a buddy's girlfriend to come to their game nights. The author wants to tell their friend that the group prefers it to be guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group has been meeting monthly, and the girlfriend has been coming the last four times. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and making the group uncomfortable. The author is gay and has been harassed by her, which is an important point. The other friends agree they don't like her but don't know how to tell the guy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong to confront their friend. Let's break it down. The author wants to be honest but in a tactful way. They mention wanting to be nice, not just confrontational. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate to exclude someone from a social group, especially a partner's significant other. \n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to their comfort. They've all agreed she's not a good fit, and the author has personal reasons (harassment) to want her out. On the other hand, the friend's girlfriend is part of his life, so excluding her could affect their friend's feelings. However, the group is supposed to be their regular get-together, so the group's dynamic might be more important. \n\nAlso, the author tried to be polite before, like lying about not having female friends, but that didn't work. The friend isn't getting the hints. So, being direct might be necessary. The way the author plans to approach it is respectful, focusing on the group dynamics rather than attacking the girlfriend personally. \n\nIs it wrong to ask a friend to not bring their partner? It can be a sensitive issue, but if the group is uncomfortable and the partner is causing issues, it's understandable. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to protect their social environment. The answer would depend on whether the group's right to their space outweighs the friend's relationship. Since the group's comfort is compromised and they've tried to handle it gently, the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer should be B.\n"
