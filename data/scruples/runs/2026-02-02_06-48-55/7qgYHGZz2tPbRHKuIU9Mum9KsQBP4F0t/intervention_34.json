It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they want to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. \n\nSo, the author and their group of friends have a monthly game night that's been a highlight for them. The friend's girlfriend has been coming four times, and she's making the nights unpleasant for everyone else. The author describes her as being overly attention-seeking, interrupting others, and even making them a stereotype as a gay guy. They mention that they've tried being tactful, but the girlfriend doesn't get the hint. Now, the author wants to rip the band-aid off and tell the friend directly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics. The group's social event has changed, and the presence of the girlfriend is affecting their enjoyment. The author and others have discussed it and agree they don't like her there. They want to create a guys-only night, which is their way of handling it. \n\nBut is it their fault? Well, the friend's girlfriend is being disruptive, and the author is trying to address the situation. However, the way they plan to do it is by approaching the friend directly and suggesting a change. The key point is that the author is trying to communicate the group's feelings to the friend. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it. For example, could they have tried to give the girlfriend more feedback in a constructive way before deciding to exclude her entirely? The author mentioned they tried being tactful, but maybe not enough. However, since the girlfriend isn't taking hints, the author might feel that direct communication is necessary. \n\nAlso, the author is being honest about the group's discomfort. The part about the author's sexuality and the girlfriend's behavior there is a sensitive issue. If the girlfriend is making the author uncomfortable with her actions, that's a valid reason for wanting to exclude her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a group decision without consulting the friend, which might be considered abrupt. But since the group has already discussed it and the author is representing their collective concern, it's a group decision. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a real problem that's affecting their social group. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive, and the author is trying to protect the group's dynamic. The method of approaching the friend directly, though direct, is a form of honest communication. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong). The author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a valid issue that's affecting their group's enjoyment and their personal comfort, especially with the added stress of the girlfriend's behavior towards them as a gay person.\n"
