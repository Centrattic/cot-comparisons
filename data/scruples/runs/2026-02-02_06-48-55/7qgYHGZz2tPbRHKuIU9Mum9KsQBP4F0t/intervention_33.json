It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group has a monthly game night that's been a highlight for them. The friend's girlfriend has attended the last four times, making the nights unpleasant for everyone. She's described as self-centered, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push into a \"gay BFF\" role, even after the author has tried to set boundaries. The group has all talked about it but hasn't confronted the friend yet. The author wants to be direct and tell the friend they want game night to be guys-only.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so they want to know if they are correct. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to be honest and preserve the group's dynamic. They're being upfront and planning to be nice, which is mature. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly affecting the group's enjoyment, so the author has a valid reason to address it. The problem is that the girlfriend is making the game nights unenjoyable, and the group has tried to be tactful but is now reaching a breaking point.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering confronting the friend directly without perhaps considering other solutions. Maybe there's a way to include the girlfriend in a different setting or find a compromise. Also, the author's approach might be seen as harsh, especially if the friend is attached to his girlfriend. The group might need to handle this sensitively to avoid damaging their friendship with the friend.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about the morality or fairness of the action. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical in a strict sense. They're trying to maintain their social group and address a problem that's affecting them all. The girlfriend's presence is causing issues, and the group has already discussed it. The author's plan is to communicate this respectfully. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for conflict here. The friend might feel betrayed if his girlfriend is excluded without a proper discussion. The author might not have considered alternative solutions, like having separate activities or talking to the girlfriend directly. But given the information, the group has tried to be polite, and the girlfriend isn't heeding hints. The author's approach is to address the issue before it escalates further.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But I think the author has a legitimate reason to act. They're part of a group that's been affected, and they're trying to be honest. The wrong would be if they acted rudely or without considering the consequences, but the user says they plan to be nice. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the author is making assumptions about the entire group's feelings. The scenario says \"none of us like her\" but maybe that's not entirely true. The author says \"no one except her boyfriend wants her there,\" but the group has talked about it. If the group is united in this decision, then the author isn't in the wrong. Another angle is that the author is prioritizing the group's comfort over the friend's feelings. That's a valid perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a legitimate issue affecting their group in a respectful manner.\n"
