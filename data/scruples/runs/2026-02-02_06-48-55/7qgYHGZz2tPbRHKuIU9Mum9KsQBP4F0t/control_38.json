It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends having a monthly game night, which has become unpleasant because one friend's girlfriend keeps coming. She's described as annoying, always trying to take over conversations, and making the author uncomfortable by pushing him into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype, being touchy-feely, and invading his personal space when he went to a gay bar.\n\nThe author wants to tell his buddy that the group doesn't want the girlfriend to come anymore. The friends have discussed this and agree, except the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author plans to be direct but nice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend is making the game night uncomfortable for everyone except her boyfriend. The author is a gay individual who doesn't want to be in a certain role, so the girlfriend's actions are not just annoying but also potentially intrusive and disrespectful. The friends have talked about it but are hesitant to approach the situation. The author is suggesting a direct approach, which might be necessary if the others are avoiding the conversation.\n\nIs it wrong to address this? Well, it's a group setting, and the author feels that the dynamic has changed. The key issue here is that the author is trying to protect the group's comfort and the event's original purpose. The girlfriend is not part of the regular group, so maybe the group should maintain its original format. However, the author is being specific about not wanting her there, which could be seen as personal, but since others also feel this way, it's about the group dynamic.\n\nPotential problems: The author might be biased because of their personal discomfort due to the girlfriend's actions against their identity. However, the other friends also don't like her, so it's not just the author. The approach is to be respectful and suggest an alternative. But the author is lying about not having female friends, which could be a red flag. However, that was a past attempt to set boundaries and failed. The main question is whether the author is justified in speaking up for the group.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend is a third party. The author is not the one in a relationship with her, so maybe the author has the right to express their discomfort to the friend. But should they do it directly? Maybe they should first suggest the group as a whole approaches the friend together to avoid putting one person on the spot.\n\nAlso, the author's solution is to make it a guys-only night, which could be reasonable if the group originally was male-only. However, the friend might feel excluded if the girlfriend is not allowed. The author's intention is to restore the original dynamic, which is valid, but the method needs to be respectful.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is B (No), because the group has a right to set boundaries for their own event. The author isn't the only one who's uncomfortable; others agree. Telling the friend directly but nicely is a mature approach. While lying before (about not having female friends) was a problem, the current action is about honest communication to preserve the group's atmosphere. The author isn't being malicious but is addressing a real issue affecting the group. It's possible that the author is in the right, but maybe the group should handle it together. However, the question is about the author specifically. Since they're not the sole one and are doing it for the group's sake, they're not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but is the author the one who's being wrong by excluding the girlfriend? If the friend is okay with her coming, but the rest of the group isn't, the author is acting on behalf of the group. However, maybe the friend should be consulted more, but the author is just informing him of the group's collective feeling. The author isn't being rude in the proposed message. So, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that affects the group's experience and are being respectful.\n"
