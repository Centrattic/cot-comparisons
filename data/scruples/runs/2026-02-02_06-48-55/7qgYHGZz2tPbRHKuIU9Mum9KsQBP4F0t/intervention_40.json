It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night, but one member's girlfriend keeps coming, making it unpleasant for everyone else. The author wants to confront the friend and tell him that the group wants to make it guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The author mentions that the girlfriend is very self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes. The group has discussed this and doesn't want her there, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author is considering a direct approach.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group is within their rights to set boundaries for their own social gatherings. They can decide who is invited if it's a private event. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly causing distress, so it's reasonable for the group to want to exclude her to preserve the event's enjoyment.\n\nHowever, the way they plan to approach it matters. The author wants to tell the friend directly, which could be hurtful if not done sensitively. But the author says they'll be nice and explain that the group dynamic has changed. It's important to communicate this without being confrontational or blaming the girlfriend. The friend might need to hear it from someone else if the group isn't doing it themselves, but the author is taking initiative, which could be justified if the group isn't acting.\n\nAnother point is the girlfriend's behavior. If she's being disruptive and not respecting others, the group has a right to protect their space. The author's discomfort as a gay person being pushed into a stereotype adds another layer of personal boundaries being violated.\n\nBut maybe there's a more tactful way to handle it. For example, the group could have a private discussion with the friend without singling out the girlfriend. The author's approach might come off as harsh, but if it's done respectfully, it might be necessary. The key is whether the author's intention is to maintain the group's well-being without being unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to protect the group's social event from someone who's making it unpleasant. The method might need to be more diplomatic, but the intent is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
