It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group of friends has a monthly game night. One friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times, making it unpleasant for others. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting conversations, and making the gay author uncomfortable with her behavior. The group has discussed this and wants to tell the friend, but the author is considering a direct approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether their intention to address the issue makes them wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of a group that collectively finds the girlfriend's presence problematic. They've tried being tactful, but she doesn't take hints. The author's plan is to communicate the issue directly but nicely. That seems reasonable because the group's dynamic is being negatively affected. Everyone's enjoyment is important, and they have the right to feel comfortable in their social gatherings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have approached the friend first to address the issue without the girlfriend. But the post says they've already talked about it among themselves and decided to approach the friend. Also, the author mentions that the friend's girlfriend is making them uncomfortable, especially with the stereotyping and unwanted attention. The author's sexual orientation is a factor here; being forced into \"girl talk\" when they're not into it adds to the problem. \n\nThe key points are that the group has discussed it, the behavior is causing consistent discomfort, and the author's intention is to communicate this to the friend. The approach is to be respectful but clear. So, the author isn't acting out of malice but to restore the group's enjoyment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a stand for the group's well-being in a respectful way.\n"
