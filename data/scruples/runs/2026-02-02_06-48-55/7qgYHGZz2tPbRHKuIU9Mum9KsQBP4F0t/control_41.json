It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand it better.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One of their friends has a girlfriend who's attended the last four times. The author and others find her annoying because she's always the center of attention, interrupts others, and is very self-centered. Additionally, she makes the author uncomfortable by trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype, being touchy-feely, and even showed up uninvited to a gay bar. The group has discussed not liking her but is unsure how to tell their friend. The author wants to be direct and tell the friend that they want game nights to be guys-only now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The group initially okayed her coming, but now they're all uncomfortable. The author is trying to find a way to tell their friend without being harsh. The key points are: the girlfriend's behavior is making the group's time unpleasant, there's been a consensus among the group, and the author wants to address it directly but politely.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend? Well, the girlfriend's presence is causing issues, and the group has discussed it. The author is acting on behalf of the group to solve a problem that affects everyone. However, the method of communication is important. The author wants to be nice and direct, so maybe that's the right approach. But is it wrong to exclude someone? If the group is all on board, then it's about setting boundaries. The girlfriend isn't part of the core group, and the original game night was for the original five friends. Including her without the group's ongoing consent might be an issue. The author is trying to correct a situation where the group's preferences have changed.\n\nBut wait, the author's friend's girlfriend is part of the situation now. The friend's feelings could be hurt if they feel excluded. However, the author is trying to be considerate by suggesting a different time for the couple to join. So maybe the author is justified in wanting to address it. The key is whether the group's right to set boundaries for their own social gatherings overrides the friend's desire to include his girlfriend. Since the group was originally set up without her, and they've all decided they don't want her there, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate that. The author is trying to maintain the group's dynamic and comfort, which is a valid reason.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance in how it's handled. The author should ensure that the message is delivered respectfully and that the friend isn't blamed for the girlfriend's behavior. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms, but generally, friends have the right to set boundaries for their group events. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
