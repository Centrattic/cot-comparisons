It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't want the girlfriend to come to their game nights anymore. The author wants to tell their buddy that the group prefers it to be guys-only now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group of friends has a monthly game night that used to be their highlight. The girlfriend has been coming for four times and is making the gatherings unpleasant. The author describes her as annoying, attention-seeking, interrupting others, and even making them uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes on a gay friend. The other friends agree they don't like her but don't know how to tell their mutual friend. The author plans to confront the friend directly but in a nice way, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a separate time for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the group's discomfort, the girlfriend's behavior, and the approach to address it.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic. She's being inconsiderate, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and making a gay friend uncomfortable. The author and the group have tried being tactful but to no avail. The group's desire to have a space where they can enjoy each other's company without discomfort is valid. Social groups often set boundaries for their interactions.\n\nHowever, the author's approach is to confront the friend directly. The question is whether that's wrong. The author plans to be nice, so the method isn't malicious. The issue is whether it's appropriate to exclude someone from a social gathering, especially if the friend's partner is being problematic. The author is considering the well-being of the group and their need to enjoy the event. \n\nBut there might be other considerations. For example, the friend might feel hurt or think the group is being unfair. The girlfriend's presence is by the friend's invitation. The group has a right to set boundaries, especially if the environment is being ruined. The author is trying to handle it respectfully, so it's not just a personal attack but a group decision. \n\nAnother angle: is it the author's place to step in? Since the group has discussed it and the author is the one taking the lead, it's a collective decision. The problem is the friend's girlfriend's behavior affecting everyone. The author isn't attacking the friend but addressing the situation. \n\nHowever, the potential for conflict is there. The friend might not take it well. But the group's right to maintain a comfortable environment is important. The author's approach is direct but polite. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a legitimate issue that affects the group. The answer should be B (No).\n"
