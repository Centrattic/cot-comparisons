It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One of their friends has a girlfriend who's been joining for the last four times. Initially, it was okay, but the girlfriend is making the game nights unpleasant. She's described as annoying, always seeking attention, interrupting others, and being overbearing. Also, she's making the author uncomfortable by trying to stereotype him as a gay best friend despite him not wanting that. The author and others don't like her presence, but they're unsure how to tell their friend. The author wants to confront their friend directly to tell him the group should be guys-only now, maybe suggesting a different get-together for the couple.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. They and the group genuinely dislike the girlfriend's presence. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive and uncomfortable. The author has tried to be polite, even lied indirectly to set boundaries, but the girlfriend doesn't get the hint. The group feels that the dynamic has changed and they prefer a guys-only night. The author's intention is to protect the group's enjoyment and their own comfort, which makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not appreciate being told this, especially if it's a sensitive topic. The girlfriend's boyfriend might feel that his partner is being excluded without a proper explanation. The author's approach is direct, but is there a better way to handle it? Maybe discussing it privately with the friend first, or being more subtle. However, the author has already tried indirect methods without success. The group's consensus is important, so they might feel the need to act.\n\nPossible ethical considerations: Honesty vs. kindness. The author is being honest but might be causing hurt feelings. The girlfriend's presence is affecting the group's enjoyment, so their right to enjoy their social time is a factor. The author's discomfort with the girlfriend's stereotyping is valid and needs to be addressed.\n\nIs there a respectful way to handle this? The author plans to be nice, which is good. They mention talking to the friend over a beer, which is a casual setting. The message is about changing group dynamics, not attacking the girlfriend. It's about the group's preferences, not just the author's. So, even though it's direct, it's about the collective group's experience.\n\nHowever, could there be a better approach? Maybe suggesting the girlfriend attends but the group changes activities or sets boundaries. But the group has already discussed it and decided they don't want her there. So the author's plan is to communicate this truthfully.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't trying to be malicious. They're trying to maintain their group's social time as they were. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, and the group's right to set boundaries is important. So while the method could be considered harsh, the intent is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the group's interests, even if it's a tough conversation.\n"
