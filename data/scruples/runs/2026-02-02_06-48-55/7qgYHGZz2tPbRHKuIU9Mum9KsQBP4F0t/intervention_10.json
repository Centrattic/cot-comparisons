It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for planning to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. So first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the group of friends is clearly uncomfortable with the girlfriend's presence. She's described as interrupting, dominating conversations, and making the author feel stereotyped. The group has discussed this and all agree they don't like her there. The author's plan is to be direct but nice, suggesting a switch to a couples' night. That seems considerate in intent.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of honesty and the friend's feelings. The friend's girlfriend is part of their relationship, so excluding her without a private conversation might harm the friendship. The author is taking the initiative to address it, which is better than ignoring the issue. However, is it the author's right to step in like that? Maybe the friend should be approached first to discuss the problem privately before excluding the girlfriend. \n\nThe author mentions that they've tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend doesn't get the hint. The problem is ongoing. If the group is all in agreement, it's fair to set boundaries. But the method of communicating this is key. The author plans to be direct but kind, which is a mature approach. However, the fact that they're not considering the girlfriend's perspective might be a point against them. \n\nAlso, the author's personal experience of being made uncomfortable as a gay person adds another layer. The girlfriend's actions are crossing into personal space and identity, which is a valid concern. But the author's lie about not having female friends could be seen as inconsiderate, but it was an attempt to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, groups often adjust when new people join. The key is how to communicate the change. The author's approach is honest and aims to preserve the friend's relationship by suggesting a different meetup. That's respectful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're trying to protect their group's enjoyment and address valid issues. However, the method might be a bit abrupt. But given the context, maybe it's justified. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
