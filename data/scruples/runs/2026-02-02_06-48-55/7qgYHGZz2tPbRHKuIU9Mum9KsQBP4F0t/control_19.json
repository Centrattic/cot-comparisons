It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. Hmm. So the situation is that the group of friends has a monthly game night which used to be their highlight. The friend's girlfriend has been coming four times, and she's making it unpleasant. She's described as annoying, always trying to dominate conversations, and the author is gay, and the girlfriend is making him uncomfortable with her behavior, even showing up uninvited to a gay bar.\n\nThe author wants to be direct and tell their buddy that the group wants to make it guys-only and maybe meet as a couple another time. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly affecting the group's enjoyment. The author mentions they've all talked about it and none of them like her. They're trying to be tactful but she doesn't take hints. The author wants to communicate this to their friend. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing that? Well, the group is composed of friends, and it's their event. They have the right to set boundaries about who attends. The girlfriend is making it uncomfortable for others, so it's reasonable to exclude her. However, the way they approach it could matter. The author plans to be nice and explain it's a group dynamic issue, which is a respectful approach. \n\nBut maybe the author is wrong because they should have addressed this with the friend earlier, rather than waiting until now. Or maybe they're not wrong because they're maintaining their own comfort and the group's. The author's personal experience being violated by the girlfriend's actions (like the gay bar incident) adds another layer. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's feelings, the author is trying to be considerate by suggesting a different arrangement. So the author isn't being malicious. However, the act of excluding someone's partner could be seen as harsh, even if justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their social space and their personal boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is the root issue, and the author's intention is to restore their enjoyment of the event. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
