It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their friends have a monthly game night, which is supposed to be a casual get-together with just five of them. But one friend's girlfriend has been coming along for the last four times, and she's causing problems. The author and the others find her annoying, and she's making the game nights uncomfortable. The author is considering just being direct with their buddy to tell him that the group wants it to be guys-only now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. The group initially agreed to let the girlfriend come, but now it's causing issues. The author and friends are all in agreement that they don't want her there anymore. The problem is that the girlfriend is interrupting conversations, dominating attention, and even making the author uncomfortable as a gay person by trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" role. \n\nThe author is thinking of approaching their buddy to explain that the group dynamic has changed and that they prefer it to be guys-only. The author wants to be nice but is considering being straightforward. \n\nIs this the right approach? Well, the group had a specific social arrangement that might have changed without everyone's input. The issue is that the girlfriend's presence is affecting the group's enjoyment. The author is trying to address it directly with their friend, which is a reasonable step because they are part of the group that's affected. However, there's a potential issue with not considering the friend's perspective. The friend might have invited his girlfriend, so they might feel hurt or blindsided if the group suddenly excludes her without talking to them first. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they have tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. So maybe the group has tried subtle ways to signal discomfort, but it's not working. The author's plan is to be direct but kind, which is often a good approach in such situations. However, is the author in the wrong for wanting to exclude the girlfriend without considering the friend's feelings? The key here is whether the group communicated their discomfort to the friend first. If they have already talked about it and decided to take this action, maybe they have a right to set boundaries for their own social event. \n\nAnother angle: the group has the right to decide who they invite to their gatherings. If the game night is part of their group's tradition and the presence of others is disrupting it, they might be justified in changing the rules. However, they should handle it sensitively. The author's approach seems to aim for that by being honest but not confrontational. \n\nBut is there a better way? Perhaps they could have discussed it with the friend earlier, but the author is now taking the initiative. Since the entire group is in agreement, the author isn't acting alone. The answer might depend on whether the action is considered rude or necessary. In social situations, sometimes it's necessary to set boundaries, even if it means hurting someone's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain the group's enjoyment and have a valid reason for wanting to exclude someone who's making their gatherings unpleasant. The answer would be B (No). However, I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe the group should have addressed the girlfriend's behavior first before excluding her. But the author tried being polite and the girlfriend didn't respond. So, the exclusion might be the last resort. In that case, it's understandable. So I think the answer is B.\n"
