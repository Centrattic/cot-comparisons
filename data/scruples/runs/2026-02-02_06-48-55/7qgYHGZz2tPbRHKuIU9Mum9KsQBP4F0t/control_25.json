It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends who have a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been attending, causing discomfort for everyone else.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is that the girlfriend's behavior is making the game nights unpleasant. She's very talkative, centers conversations on herself, interrupts others, and is overbearing. Additionally, she's making personal comments towards the author (who is gay) that are uncomfortable, like trying to force \"girl talk\" and invading his personal space. The group collectively dislikes her but hasn't confronted the friend about it yet. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making game nights male-only, while suggesting couple gatherings on another night.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention is to address a problem that affects the group. The key here is whether the approach is justified. The group has discussed the issue, so it's not just the author's personal dislike. The girlfriend's behavior is objectively problematic\u2014interrupting, dominating conversations, and making others uncomfortable. The author's plan is to communicate this in a respectful way, not to attack the friend but to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nHowever, there might be considerations. The author is being direct, which could be seen as harsh if not handled sensitively. But since they mention wanting to be nice and approach the friend for a beer, it's about framing the issue as a group dynamic change rather than criticizing the girlfriend directly. The friend might take it as constructive feedback. Also, the group is in agreement, so the author isn't acting alone.\n\nThe other aspect is the author's own experience with the girlfriend's behavior, which is personal and valid. The author has tried to be tactful but hasn't succeeded in getting through to her. The group's consensus is important here. If the group is united, their collective action is more justifiable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, friends have the right to enjoy their time together. Including someone who makes the environment unpleasant for others is problematic. The author is advocating for the group's well-being, which is reasonable. The solution proposed is to separate the group and the couple, which is a common approach in social settings when conflicts arise.\n\nPotential arguments against the author: Maybe the friend isn't aware of how his girlfriend behaves, and the author's direct approach could strain the friendship. Alternatively, the author could have suggested other solutions first, like discussing with the girlfriend directly if possible. But since the group has already discussed it and the author is part of the group, their approach seems reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are to improve the group's experience, and the method is respectful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
