It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One of the friends brings his girlfriend four times, and the rest of the group is not happy with her presence. The author wants to tell the friend that no one wants the girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the group's perspective. They initially agreed to her coming, but now she's making the gatherings unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and being overbearing. Plus, the author is gay and uncomfortable with her trying to make him into a \"gay BFF,\" even invading his personal space at a gay bar. The other friends also don't like her but haven't said anything yet.\n\nThe author wants to approach the friend directly and tell him the group wants to make it guys-only. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to have their gatherings in a way that makes them comfortable. They've tried being tactful, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. The author is being honest and upfront, which could prevent future discomfort. The group's right to enjoy their time together is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is single-handedly making the decision to confront the friend. The group had discussed it but didn't act. The author's approach might come off as harsh or exclusionary, even if well-intended. Also, the mention of the author lying about not having female friends to avoid the girlfriend might show a lack of effort to be honest. But the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, which is making the group uncomfortable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address a problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior, but the author is the one taking action. If they approach it respectfully and as a group, maybe it's justified. However, the author is taking the initiative without maybe ensuring the entire group is on board. But the scenario says the rest of the group has talked about it and all agree. So the author is acting as a representative, which might be okay.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is justified in confronting the friend. Since the group is collectively uncomfortable and the author is being honest about the group's feelings, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the method might need to be considered\u2014like making sure it's a group decision and communicated respectfully. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms, but in general, being honest about your boundaries is often seen as the right approach.\n"
