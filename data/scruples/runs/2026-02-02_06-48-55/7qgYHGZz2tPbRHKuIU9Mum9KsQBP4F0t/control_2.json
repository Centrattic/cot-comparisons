It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The group has a monthly game night with five people, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming four times. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's talkative, interrupts, and makes a stereotype out of the author, who is gay. They've discussed it and don't like her, but they're worried about how to tell the friend.\n\nThe author wants to be direct, take the friend out for a beer, and explain that the group dynamic has changed, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a different gathering for the couple. The question is whether the author is in the wrong to do this.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the factors. The group is close-knit, and they've all talked about the issue. They're not just a couple of people; it's the whole group. The girlfriend's behavior is described as making the events unpleasant for everyone. The author is trying to be tactful, not just rude. They even came up with a polite way to phrase it.\n\nBut is it right to exclude someone from an event that they were invited to? The friend's girlfriend was initially invited, maybe with permission. The group might have implied consent by not objecting the first time. However, after four times, maybe the group's tolerance has worn thin. The friend might not be aware of how his girlfriend is affecting the group. The author is trying to be considerate by suggesting an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is part of a group that's been friends for a while. The friend's relationship with his girlfriend is separate, but the group's social event is supposed to be for them. The group has a right to set boundaries, especially if the presence of someone is making their time uncomfortable. The author's approach seems honest and direct, which is better than letting it fester.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to label the author as wrong? If the group collectively agrees and the author is just the one to approach the friend, it's a group decision. The author isn't acting alone. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior, which is making the group uncomfortable. The solution is to adjust the event to maintain the group's dynamic. The key is that they're not being malicious, just setting boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B.\n"
