It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like the girlfriend of one of their friends attending their game nights. The author wants to tell his buddy that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group initially didn't mind the girlfriend coming but found her presence unenjoyable. She's described as self-centered, interruptive, and intrusive, especially towards the author who is gay and doesn't want to be part of \"girl talk.\" The group has discussed this and agrees she's not wanted. The author wants to confront his friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group is the one being affected. They have a right to their social space and might feel uncomfortable. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic, causing discomfort and making the gatherings unpleasant. The author is trying to address this by having a conversation with his friend, which is a direct but potentially honest approach.\n\nHowever, there's a need to consider how the message is delivered. The author plans to be nice, so that's a positive. But sometimes, even well-intentioned messages can hurt if not approached carefully. The key here is whether the author is justified in making the request. Since the group is unhappy and the girlfriend's behavior is detrimental, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. It's about social dynamics and mutual respect. The friend's girlfriend is affecting the group's enjoyment, so the group has the right to express that.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it. The author should consider if there's a more tactful approach, like suggesting a group discussion rather than one-on-one, to avoid making the friend feel blamed. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach. Given the circumstances, the author's intention is to protect the group's space, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's desire to communicate the problem to his friend. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
