It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who have game nights, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, making it unpleasant for everyone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend is annoying, takes over conversations, and makes them uncomfortable due to her behavior towards him as a gay person. The group has talked about it and doesn't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The author's intention is to set boundaries for their group's comfort. They're being honest and direct, which some might see as tactful. However, the approach of telling the friend that \"no one wants her\" might come across as harsh or insensitive. The friend might feel betrayed if his girlfriend is excluded without his input or if the group didn't address the issue earlier.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior is disruptive. The author is trying to protect the group dynamic, which is understandable. But the method of communication is important. Instead of a blunt \"no one wants her,\" maybe a more constructive approach to discuss the issues privately first. The author might be justified in wanting to change the dynamic, but the way they plan to do it could be problematic. They should consider the friend's feelings and perhaps suggest a solution that includes the couple in a different setting, rather than making it seem like the girlfriend is unwanted.\n\nAnother angle: the author is lying about not having female friends. That could be a red flag. Maybe the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the group. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's personal preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to address a real problem. But their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since they are planning to communicate the issue directly but politely, and the group is collectively uncomfortable, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a better way without being blunt. The author's plan to talk to the friend directly is reasonable, but the phrasing \"no one wants her\" is very harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the core issue is valid. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
