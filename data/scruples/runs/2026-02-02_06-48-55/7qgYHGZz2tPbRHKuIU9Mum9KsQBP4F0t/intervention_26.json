It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night. The situation is that the group of friends has game nights, and the friend's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times. She's described as annoying, always interrupting, and being overly touchy with the author, who is gay. The group doesn't like her but doesn't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to just come out and say it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group originally agreed when the girlfriend was invited once, but her continued presence is causing discomfort. The author mentions that they've tried being tactful, but she doesn't take hints. The group has all talked about it and agrees they don't like her.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The group's discomfort with her presence, 2) The author's personal issues with her behavior, especially regarding their sexuality, and 3) The method of confronting the friend. \n\nIs it wrong to tell the friend? Well, the group's plan is to tell him that the dynamic has changed and they want it to be guys-only. They want to be nice about it. But the problem might be that they're excluding the girlfriend without considering if the friend is aware of her behavior. Maybe the friend is unaware, and the girlfriend is just acting out because of her own personality. The author's approach is direct, which could be seen as honest, but it's also potentially hurtful. \n\nAnother angle: The group is excluding someone based on personal preferences. Is that fair? If the friend's girlfriend is indeed being disruptive, then maybe the group has the right to set boundaries. However, the way they're doing it could be problematic if they're not giving her a chance to improve or if the friend isn't aware of the specific issues. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's attempts to touch and engage in \"girl talk\" could be valid, especially if it's making them uncomfortable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're being honest and setting boundaries for their group, maybe not. But they should make sure the approach is respectful and gives the friend a chance to address the issues with his girlfriend. The problem is whether the group's collective decision is fair and communicated properly without being harsh. The author's plan seems direct but might not be the most tactful way. However, the alternative is to keep the girlfriend around, making everyone uncomfortable. \n\nIn terms of ethics, groups have the right to set their own boundaries. If the girlfriend's behavior is making the experience unpleasant for everyone, then the group can decide to change the dynamic. However, the method of communication is important. The author wants to rip the bandaid off, which is direct but might not be the most sensitive approach. Still, the intent is to be honest and respectful, as they mention wanting to be nice. \n\nThe author's personal issues with the girlfriend are valid, especially regarding their boundaries as a gay man. It's important to respect personal space and not be forced into interactions one is uncomfortable with. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're addressing a real problem affecting the group's enjoyment. However, the method could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since the group has discussed it and agrees, and the author's approach is to communicate it respectfully, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a perspective where being direct without giving the friend a chance to mediate first is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have talked to the friend privately first before taking the group approach. But the scenario says they have all talked about it and want to approach him together. So, maybe it's justified.\n"
