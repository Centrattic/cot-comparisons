It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is part of a group of five friends who have a monthly game night. It used to be their highlight of the month, but now one of their friends' girlfriends has been attending for the last four times. The author and others find her annoying because she's always the center of attention, interrupts conversations, and isn't very interesting. Also, she's been making the author uncomfortable by trying to make him be the \"gay BFF\" type, being touchy-feely, and even showing up uninvited to a gay bar. The author and the rest of the group want to tell their friend that they don't want his girlfriend at the game night anymore, but they're unsure how to approach it. The author is considering being direct and suggesting a guys-only night.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she's described as being very self-centered, interrupting others, talking over people, and not contributing to good conversation. If that's the case, it's understandable that the group would find her presence unwelcome. However, the author is considering telling their friend that the group wants to make it guys-only, which could be seen as excluding his partner. Even if the group has consensus, they might be overstepping by making the friend's girlfriend the issue instead of addressing the girlfriend's behavior directly with her. But in the scenario, the group hasn't done that; they've only discussed it among themselves and are planning to approach their friend.\n\nThen there's the personal issue with the author being gay. The girlfriend's actions are making him uncomfortable by forcing him into a \"gay BFF\" stereotype and invading his personal space. This is a valid concern, and the author has a right to feel uncomfortable. However, the way he's handling it is by considering excluding the girlfriend entirely rather than addressing her behavior. \n\nSo the main question is whether it's appropriate for the author to tell their buddy that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come. On one hand, the group is a close-knit group of friends, and if her presence is making the gatherings unpleasant, they might need to set boundaries. On the other hand, excluding someone based on their relationship status or partner's behavior could be problematic, especially if it's not handled with care. The author's approach is to be direct but nice, which is a common strategy, but the way the message is phrased might be where the issue is.\n\nThe author says they want to tell their friend that the group dynamic has changed with a girl in the mix and suggest a guys-only night. This could be perceived as blaming the girlfriend's gender for the problem, which is a bit stereotyping and might not be fair. Instead of focusing on the presence of a girl, they should address the specific behaviors that are causing discomfort. Also, if the rest of the group is in agreement, maybe that's a valid reason to change the format. However, the fact that the author is the only one who's personally uncomfortable with the girlfriend's actions (like the gay BFF stuff) adds another layer. The group might not be aware of the personal issues the author is facing, which could mean that their discomfort is contributing to the overall negative vibe.\n\nAnother angle: the author and others have tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend hasn't taken hints. The author even lied about having no female friends to set a boundary. If the girlfriend is being inconsiderate and not respecting personal space, maybe it's reasonable to exclude her entirely. But the method of exclusion\u2014telling the friend that \"no one wants her\"\u2014could be hurtful and might damage their friendship. The author should be honest and address the specific issues rather than making a blanket statement about the group not wanting her. Also, considering that the friend might value his girlfriend's inclusion, the group should handle it with empathy and provide examples of how her presence is affecting the game night, rather than just changing the dynamic without discussion.\n\nAdditionally, the author is part of a group that's already discussed this and feels the need to act collectively. If they don't all approach the friend together, it might come off as the author being the antagonist. The key points here are the right to set boundaries, the method of communication, and the fairness of the approach. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They have a right to feel uncomfortable in their social circle. However, the way they're approaching the situation could be improved. Instead of implying that the entire group doesn't want her, they should focus on the specific behaviors. Also, suggesting a guys-only night could be a way to maintain the group's dynamic. But if the message is framed as excluding the girlfriend because she's a girl, that could be problematic. The author's personal issues with the girlfriend's stereotyping behavior are valid, but the group's approach should be inclusive and respectful, not just about keeping it guys-only.\n\nIn summary, the author's intention to address the problem is understandable, but the method might be flawed. The real issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not her gender. So the group should approach the friend by discussing the specific issues rather than making the exclusion based on her presence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the message is based on her gender rather than her actions. But if they're addressing the behavior and suggesting a guys-only night as a solution, maybe not. The line is blurry here. The answer depends on whether the exclusion is justified by the behavior or by the person's identity. If the problem is her behavior, then the group is not in the wrong for wanting to address it. If they're excluding her because she's a girl, regardless of behavior, that's more problematic. The scenario states that the group's issue is with her behavior, so their approach is to exclude her. But the author's personal discomfort adds another layer. The author is right to feel uncomfortable, but the way they propose to solve it might not be the best. They should communicate the specific issues to their friend and perhaps suggest a guys-only format, but not necessarily imply that the group doesn't want her because she's a girl. The answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're dealing with a legitimate discomfort and the group has discussed it. However, the way to phrase the message is important. If they frame it correctly, it's not wrong. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend. The group's consensus is that they don't like her, so the author is right to act according to the group's wishes. But maybe the group's consensus is based on her behavior, so they're not wrong. The key is whether the exclusion is based on behavior or identity. Since it's based on behavior, the answer is B. The user thought the author was in the wrong, but if the group is genuinely finding her behavior off-putting and the author is part of that collective decision, then it's not necessarily wrong. The author's personal issues are part of the reason, but if the group is united, then it's acceptable to set that boundary.\n"
