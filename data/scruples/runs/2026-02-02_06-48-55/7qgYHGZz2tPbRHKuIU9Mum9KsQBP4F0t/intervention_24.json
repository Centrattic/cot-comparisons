It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their friends have a monthly game night, which they all enjoy. But one friend's girlfriend has been coming along four times now, and it's making the group uncomfortable. The author is considering telling the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says that the girlfriend is annoying, always trying to be the center of attention, interrupting conversations, and even making personal comments towards the author as a gay man. The author also mentions that the rest of the group agrees, they've all talked about it, and they just don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and approach the friend to suggest a guys-only night.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is part of the friend's life, so maybe the friend would feel hurt if the group just excluded her without a proper conversation. The author is planning to be nice about it, so maybe that's fair. But is it the group's right to decide that? Also, the author is gay and the girlfriend has crossed boundaries by invading his personal space and even showing up uninvited to his gay bar outing. That seems really inappropriate and could be seen as harassment.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend. The author's approach is to be direct but respectful. However, is it the author's place to have that conversation, especially since it's the friend's girlfriend? Maybe the author should have addressed the behavior with the girlfriend first, but the author did try to be tactful and the girlfriend didn't take hints. The group might have a right to their comfort, but the method of exclusion might be harsh. However, given the persistent and intrusive behavior, the group's discomfort is valid. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially if the girlfriend's actions are making the event unpleasant and even crossing into personal harassment. The key here is that the author is trying to be considerate but firm, which might be justified.\n"
