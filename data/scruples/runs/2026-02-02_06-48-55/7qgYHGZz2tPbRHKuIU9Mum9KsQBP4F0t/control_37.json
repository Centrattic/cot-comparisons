It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like the girlfriend coming to their game night. The author wants to tell their friend that no one wants the girlfriend there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friends have discussed it and don't like the girlfriend's behavior. She's described as being very self-centered, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable with her actions. The author is gay, and the girlfriend's behavior is making him feel stereotyped, which adds another layer of discomfort.\n\nThe author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making the game night guys-only. The main question is whether this action is wrong. On one hand, the author is being honest with the friend about the group's feelings, which is important for maintaining trust and the group's well-being. On the other hand, there's a risk of hurting the friend's feelings or damaging the friendship if the friend is protective of his girlfriend.\n\nBut wait, the friends have already discussed this and all agree, so the author isn't acting alone. The approach is to be tactful, as mentioned in the proposed message. The key points are that the group is uncomfortable, they've tried to be polite, and the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The author is trying to be direct but respectful. \n\nIs it wrong to tell a friend that their partner's presence is causing issues? It's a sensitive situation, but if the group is consistent in their feelings and approaching the friend directly, it's a valid step. The alternative might be continued discomfort and possibly the group breaking apart. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. They're trying to address a problem that's affecting their social group and their own well-being.\n"
