It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group of friends has a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and making the events unpleasant. The author is gay and feels uncomfortable with her trying to make him into the \"gay best friend\" stereotype, being overly touchy, and invading his personal space. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence, but they don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and have a conversation with the friend to exclude the girlfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their comfort and to enjoy group activities. If the girlfriend's behavior is genuinely making the game night unenjoyable for everyone, the group might need to address it. The author's intention is to improve the group dynamic, which is understandable. Also, the fact that the rest of the group agrees suggests it's a collective decision, not just the author's personal dislike.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach might be problematic. The author is planning to confront the friend directly without the group's consensus on the method. Even though the group talked about it, maybe they should have come up with a unified plan. Also, the author's method of being blunt could hurt the friend's feelings. Is there a more tactful way? Also, the author mentions that the friend's girlfriend is \"not that interesting\" and that they all just don't like her. But maybe there's a possibility of resolving the issue without excluding her entirely\u2014like setting boundaries or having a conversation with her first?\n\nAnother point is the stereotype issue. The author is gay and the girlfriend's behavior makes him uncomfortable by trying to impose a stereotype. That's a valid personal issue, but perhaps the group should address that directly with her first. Maybe the problem could be solved by the author setting personal boundaries without the group having to exclude her.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's right to act. Since the group as a whole is on board and the author is proposing a respectful approach (being nice and suggesting meeting as a couple instead), maybe it's justified. However, the way the group talks about not liking her might come across as judgmental. They should focus on the impact of her behavior on the group dynamic rather than personal dislike. Also, the author's plan to confront the friend alone might not be the best approach if the rest of the group isn't prepared to back it up.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, sometimes it's necessary to adjust group settings to maintain the enjoyment of all members. But the method of communication is crucial. The author's approach is to be direct but polite, which is better than ignoring the issue. However, maybe the group should have discussed with the friend's girlfriend first to see if she could modify her behavior instead of excluding her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the group is acting in their own interests to maintain their social space. However, the approach could be improved. The key here is whether the exclusion is necessary. If the girlfriend's behavior is making the event unenjoyable for everyone, then maybe the author is justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there are elements of the approach that could be problematic. However, given the information, the author's intention is to improve a shared experience, which is reasonable.\n"
