It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the author and their friends have a monthly game night, which has become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started attending. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, and making the author uncomfortable due to his sexuality. The friends have discussed it and want to tell the friend to exclude her, maybe have a guys-only night.\n\nHmm, so the author is considering being direct. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to weigh the arguments. On one hand, the friends have a right to enjoy their gatherings, and if the girlfriend is making it unenjoyable for them, they might feel justified. On the other hand, the author is being honest about the group's feelings, but maybe in a way that's harsh. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions they've tried to be tactful and even lied about not having female friends. The girlfriend isn't taking hints, which the author finds frustrating. The friends are a group, and they all agree. So maybe the author isn't wrong in wanting to address it. However, the approach could be sensitive. Telling the friend that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a separate time for the couple might be reasonable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the group truly doesn't want her there, then being upfront might be necessary. The alternative is letting the friend keep bringing her, which would continue to make the group uncomfortable. The author's intention is to preserve the group's enjoyment, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is whether the approach is respectful. The author says they would be nice about it, so maybe it's justified. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
