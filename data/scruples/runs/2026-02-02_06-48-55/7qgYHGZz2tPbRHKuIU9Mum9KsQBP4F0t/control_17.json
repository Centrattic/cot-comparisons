It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which was once a highlight. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting people, and making the author uncomfortable because of her behavior, especially since the author is gay and she tries to be overly affectionate or make him into a \"gay BFF.\" The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her there. The author wants to confront the friend directly, suggesting a guys-only night.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, friends should be able to communicate openly, but there's a line. The group is unanimous in their dislike, but the girlfriend's presence was initially okay. The key points here are the impact on the group's enjoyment and the author's personal discomfort, especially regarding being made to feel a stereotype. The author is trying to address a real issue that's affecting their social gatherings negatively.\n\nHowever, the approach matters. Telling the friend directly could hurt him, but the author plans to be nice. The alternative is to let it continue, which might make everyone unhappy. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to restore the original group dynamic. So, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
