It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the initial question is in the wrong. The question is whether telling their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend at game night is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be the highlight for the author. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times and is making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as self-centered, interrupting others, trying to dominate conversations, and making the author uncomfortable by pushing gay stereotypes and being overly touchy. The author mentions that they've all talked about it and none of them like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The plan is to be direct and suggest a guys-only night.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group has a right to set boundaries for their social time. They've discussed it among themselves, so it's a collective decision. The girlfriend's behavior is negatively affecting their enjoyment, which is valid. The approach the author plans to take is to be honest but kind, focusing on the group dynamic rather than the girlfriend herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering cutting out a couple from a shared activity that they were initially invited to. The friend's feelings might get hurt, and the girlfriend's presence was initially okay. The author is making assumptions that the rest of the group agrees, which could be a problem if others haven't all truly agreed.\n\nBut the key points here are that the group has discussed it, they're not targeting the friend's relationship, just adjusting the format. The author is trying to be tactful. The girlfriend's behavior is causing issues that the group should address. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries to preserve their group's comfort. The answer is B (No).\n"
