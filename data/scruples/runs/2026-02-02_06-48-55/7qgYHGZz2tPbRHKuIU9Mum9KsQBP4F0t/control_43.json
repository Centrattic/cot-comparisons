It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The group of friends has regular game nights, which were initially enjoyable but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started attending. The author describes her as annoying, dominating conversations, being inconsiderate, and making the author uncomfortable with her behavior, especially given the author's sexuality. The group has discussed it and doesn't want her there, but they're unsure how to tell their friend. The author wants to be direct and honest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is part of a group that's decided collectively that they don't want the girlfriend to come. Their reasons are valid because the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment and making someone uncomfortable. The author is trying to address a real issue that's impacting their social time and personal boundaries. Being honest could be the right approach to maintain the group's dynamic and the friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering excluding someone's partner without perhaps a very tactful approach. There's a risk of hurting their friend's feelings and potentially damaging the friendship. The author's method of \"ripping the bandaid off\" might be abrupt, but they mention being nice about it. The key point is whether the author's intent is justified. Since the group has collectively discussed the issue and the author's discomfort is genuine, the action might be seen as necessary for their own well-being and the group's cohesion.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't generalize the group's dislike as the sole reason, but the scenario states that all the friends have talked about it. Also, the author's personal boundaries regarding the girlfriend's behavior are important. The author's lie about not having female friends could indicate they've tried but the girlfriend doesn't take hints. So, the author's actions are based on a shared group decision and personal discomfort that's been persistent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate issue that's affecting the group and their own well-being. The approach might need to be sensitive, but the intent is valid.\n"
