It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group of friends has a monthly game night that's become less enjoyable because the friend's girlfriend is there. She's described as annoying, self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to force a gay BFF stereotype and invades his personal space. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and honest but also nice.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. \n\nThe author's intention is to protect the group's dynamic and their enjoyment. They're not being cruel; they're being honest. However, the approach is to go directly to the friend and communicate the issue. The key points here are whether the author is justified in their feelings and if their method of addressing it is appropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic. She's making the events unpleasant for everyone, and the author has specific examples of her being overbearing and intrusive. The author has tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't taking hints, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe method the author is considering is to be straightforward but kind. They're not attacking the girlfriend, just explaining that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a separate time. The author is trying to be considerate of the friend's feelings by offering an alternative. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author is part of a group that's collectively excluding someone. But since the group has discussed it and all agree, it's a group decision, not just the author's. The issue is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a gay man, and the girlfriend's behavior is crossing boundaries by trying to impose a stereotype and invading his personal space. This adds another layer of discomfort, which is a valid reason for the author's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not wrong in wanting to address the issue. They have legitimate reasons and are trying to handle it respectfully. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
