It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person is part of a group of friends who have a monthly game night. It used to be their favorite thing. One of their friends has a girlfriend who has been coming to the game night for the last four times. Initially, they didn't mind, but now the girlfriend is making the gatherings unpleasant. The author describes her as annoying, constantly seeking attention, interrupting conversations, and trying to make the author (who is gay) into a \"gay bff\" type. There's also an incident where the girlfriend showed up uninvited at a gay bar and ruined his night. The author and the group don't like her but are struggling to tell their friend. The author wants to be direct and tell the friend that the group dynamic has changed and suggest a guys-only night, maybe a different time with the couple.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by considering telling the friend this. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is part of a group that collectively doesn't like the girlfriend's presence. They've all talked about it, so it's not just the author's opinion. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic: she's disruptive, inconsiderate, and makes the author uncomfortable with her actions related to his sexuality. The author has tried to be tactful but the girlfriend doesn't take hints. \n\nNow, the author is thinking of being direct with the friend. The proposed approach seems respectful: not blaming the girlfriend but explaining that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a guys-only night. It's a group decision, not just the author's. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried to include the girlfriend in the conversations or give her feedback. However, the author mentions that the group has already discussed it and none of them like her, so they might not want to confront her directly. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior (e.g., invading his personal space, showing up uninvited) is valid. \n\nIs the author overstepping by confronting the friend? If the group is unified in their decision and the approach is respectful, then it's a legitimate way to maintain their social group's well-being. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to address a situation that's affecting their enjoyment and comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, could this hurt the friend? The friend might feel betrayed if his girlfriend is excluded. But the author is presenting this as a group decision, not just an individual one. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is causing issues for the group, so it's a collective problem that needs a collective solution. \n\nI think the key points are the group's consensus, the validity of the girlfriend's behavior as problematic, and the respectful approach proposed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
