It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One of their friends has brought his girlfriend along four times, and the rest of the group is really not enjoying her presence. The author is considering telling their buddy that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author mentions that the girlfriend is very self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the conversations unpleasant. She also makes the author uncomfortable by trying to push him into a \"gay BFF\" stereotype, which he's not comfortable with. The other friends have discussed this and all agree they don't like her, but none have told the guy. The author wants to be direct and suggest making game night a guys-only event, maybe with a separate meetup for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a real issue that's affecting the group's enjoyment and his personal comfort. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic, and the author is being considerate by planning to approach the friend kindly. The author is being honest about the group's feelings and offering an alternative, which seems fair. It's also mentioned that the other friends agree, so it's not just the author's opinion. The author is trying to maintain the group dynamic and their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to handle it without being so direct. Perhaps they could have given the girlfriend more chances or tried to address the issues with her first. But the author has tried to be tactful in the past without success. The girlfriend doesn't take hints, so a more direct approach might be necessary. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend directly but is focusing on the group dynamic and suggesting a solution (guys-only night). It's also about the author's personal boundaries regarding the unwanted attention and stereotypes.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions seem reasonable. They want to protect the group's enjoyment and their own comfort. The approach is respectful, not confrontational, and offers an alternative. The author isn't being malicious but is addressing a legitimate problem. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B). However, I need to be careful here. Sometimes, even if the intention is good, the way to handle it might be questionable. But in this case, the author is being honest and trying to resolve the issue amicably. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
