It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which used to be fun, but the friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times now. She's described as annoying\u2014dominating conversations, interrupting others, and being pushy. Additionally, she's been making the author uncomfortable because of her behavior towards them, especially since the author is gay and doesn't want to be stereotyped. The group is all in agreement that they don't like her presence but don't know how to approach the friend. The author wants to be direct and tell the friend that the group is now guys-only, suggesting a different time for the couple.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is part of a group that's been negatively affected by the girlfriend's behavior. They're trying to maintain their social space and comfort. The girlfriend's actions are making the game night unpleasant for everyone, so maybe the author is justified in wanting to address it.\n\nBut on the other hand, the approach is to directly confront the friend without including the girlfriend. The author wants to tell the friend that the group is guys-only, which could hurt the friend's feelings. Also, the author's reasoning about the group dynamic changing could be valid, but the way it's presented might come off as excluding the girlfriend without her knowing or having input. There's also the part where the author lied about not having female friends to avoid the situation, which shows they tried to be polite before. However, the friend's girlfriend isn't aware of how her presence is affecting others.\n\nAnother angle: the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior towards them (the touchy-feely stuff and the incident at the gay bar) adds to the justification. It's not just about the group's preferences but also about personal boundaries being violated.\n\nBut is it the author's place to make a group decision to exclude someone? The group discussed it, so maybe they have collective input. However, excluding someone from a social group can be seen as harsh, even if the behavior is problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions are the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group should have handled it more privately or found another way to address it with both the friend and his girlfriend. By going directly to the friend without involving the girlfriend, there's a risk of causing conflict between the friend and the girlfriend. The author's approach might not give the friend a chance to mediate the situation with his partner.\n\nHowever, the group has already decided they're all in agreement, so maybe the author is just acting on behalf of the group. The question is whether the method (being direct and telling the friend) is the wrong approach. The author claims to be nice about it, so maybe that's considered respectful.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes friends do have to address issues where a partner is affecting group dynamics. But it's important to be considerate. The author's method might be seen as correct because they're trying to be honest and maintain the group's enjoyment. However, the exclusion of the girlfriend without her knowing might be problematic. But if the friend is the one to communicate it to his girlfriend, that's probably better.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to address the situation, especially since the group is united and the behavior is clearly causing issues. The answer is B.\n"
