It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group of friends having a game night, and one of the friends' girlfriends has been coming along for four times. The author and the group find her annoying because she's domineering, talks too much, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable with their gay identity. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics. The group initially allowed the girlfriend to come but now it's become a problem. The author mentions that the group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her. The main issue is how to approach the friend about this. The author wants to be direct and honest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by confronting the friend. Let's think about the potential consequences. If they don't address it, the game night remains unpleasant for everyone. On the other hand, if they do address it, the friend might feel hurt or betrayed, especially if he's invested in his girlfriend being part of the group. The author's approach is to be nice but firm, suggesting changing the group dynamic to guys-only nights.\n\nIs there a more tactful way? Maybe, but the author is trying to be respectful. The problem is that the girlfriend's presence is making the game nights unenjoyable for everyone else. The author's intention is to restore the original fun of the group. However, they need to communicate this without burning bridges with their friend. \n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the girlfriend is making the author feel stereotyped and uncomfortable. That's a valid personal issue. The group's collective discomfort is also a factor. If the author is honest but kind, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the way they present it could be seen as ganging up on the friend or being harsh, that's different. The example statement they have is pretty reasonable: explaining the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a separate time for the couple. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author is part of a group that's collectively decided this, so it's not just one person's opinion. The friend's girlfriend's behavior is affecting everyone's experience. So, the author is acting on behalf of the group to protect their social event. \n\nHowever, could this be seen as being rude or inconsiderate? The friend might feel that the group is being unfair to his partner. The author is aware of the friend's feelings but is prioritizing the group's experience. It's a tough balance. \n\nIn some perspectives, friends should have the right to bring a partner, but if it's negatively impacting the group, maybe it's acceptable to set boundaries. The key is how it's communicated. Since the author plans to be nice and offer an alternative, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nBut the initial question asks if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide. If the author's approach is honest and respectful, then maybe not. However, if they're being overly harsh or not considering the friend's feelings enough, maybe yes. \n\nGiven that the author has tried to be tactful in the past and the girlfriend hasn't taken hints, the author is justified in taking a stronger approach to protect the group's enjoyment. The problem is that the girlfriend's presence is making the game night unenjoyable for everyone. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to address a legitimate issue affecting the group.\n"
