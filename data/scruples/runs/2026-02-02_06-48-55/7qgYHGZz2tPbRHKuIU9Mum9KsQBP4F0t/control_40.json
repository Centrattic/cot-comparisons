It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One friend's girlfriend has started attending the last four times, and the author and the rest of the group find her extremely annoying. She's described as self-centered, interrupting others, talking over them, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose her own stereotypes about being a gay BFF. The group has all discussed their dislike for her but hasn't confronted their friend. The author wants to \"rip the bandaid off\" by telling their friend directly that the group wants to make it guys-only and maybe have a separate night for the couple.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend about not wanting the girlfriend at game night. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key points here are the author's justification and the social implications. The author mentions that the group dynamic has changed and that they don't enjoy the gatherings anymore. The girlfriend's behavior is described as problematic. The author is trying to be tactful, but the situation has caused ongoing discomfort. The group has discussed it but hasn't acted yet.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't being malicious. They're addressing a genuine issue that's affecting the group's enjoyment. However, the approach of confronting the friend directly without a prior discussion with the group might be abrupt. But the author does say they would be nice about it and have a plan. The main conflict is whether it's right to exclude someone based on the group's discomfort, even if that person is part of a friend's relationship.\n\nOn one hand, the group has the right to set boundaries for their own gatherings. If the girlfriend's presence is making the event unpleasant for everyone else, excluding her could be justified. On the other hand, the author is bypassing the friend by not discussing it with him first, but the author mentions that the friend's girlfriend is the one causing issues, not the friend himself. The author is trying to preserve the group's dynamic, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nAlso, considering the author's personal discomfort due to the girlfriend's behavior\u2014like the unwanted touch and stereotyping\u2014it's a valid reason to take action. The author has tried to be polite, even going as far as lying about not having female friends. The girlfriend isn't taking hints, so the author's direct approach might be necessary.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the author should have addressed the issues with the girlfriend first or the friend, rather than excluding her outright. However, the author states that the rest of the group has already discussed it, and they all agree. So the author's plan is a collective decision, even if it's being executed by one person. The way the author is framing the situation\u2014as a change in group dynamics and wanting a guys-only night\u2014could be respectful if communicated properly.\n\nAnother angle: is the author being discriminatory? The author is gay but doesn't fit a certain stereotype, and the girlfriend is trying to force that identity. So the author's discomfort is not about the girlfriend being a woman but about her specific behavior and attempts to impose stereotypes. That's a personal boundary issue, not a prejudice against women in general. Therefore, the author is standing up for their own comfort and the group's enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are justified. They're trying to address a real problem that's affecting the group's social events and their own well-being. The approach might need to be handled carefully, but the intention isn't malicious. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
