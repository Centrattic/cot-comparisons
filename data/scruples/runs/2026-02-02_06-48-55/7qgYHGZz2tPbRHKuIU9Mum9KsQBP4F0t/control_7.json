It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The main points are that the group of friends has monthly game nights, which used to be fun but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started joining. The girlfriend is described as being overly attention-seeking, interrupting conversations, and making others uncomfortable, especially the author who is gay and doesn't appreciate her attempts to be overly familiar.\n\nThe group has discussed this and agrees they don't like her presence, but they're hesitant on how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making game night only for guys. The question is whether this approach is wrong.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group is unanimous in their dislike of the girlfriend's presence, which is causing discomfort and ruining the event. They've tried being polite and giving subtle hints but to no avail. The author's plan is to be direct but nice, suggesting a different arrangement. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with group dynamics here. The friend's girlfriend is part of the situation, and the group is excluding someone without considering other perspectives. Maybe the friend isn't aware of the extent of the problem, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. If the author approaches the friend directly, they might be seen as betraying the girlfriend or not handling it privately enough. But since all the friends agree, maybe the collective approach is justified.\n\nAnother angle is the method of communication. The author wants to be \"nice\" but the friend might take it as a personal attack if not handled sensitively. Also, the friend's girlfriend's behavior might have underlying reasons that the group isn't aware of. However, the group has tried multiple times to hint and the behavior continues, so the friend might not be aware of the problem. \n\nThe key here is whether the group's right to have a comfortable environment outweighs the friend's right to bring his girlfriend. Since it's a private gathering and the group is the host, they can set boundaries. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to establish that boundary, especially if the group is supportive. \n\nBut there's also the consideration of how to communicate it. The author's approach is direct but respectful, which is better than letting the situation fester. However, maybe the group should talk to the friend together rather than one-on-one, but the scenario says they all talked and agree. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't doing anything malicious here. They're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment of their shared activity. The girlfriend's behavior is impacting others, and the group is trying to address it. So, the author's intention isn't to hurt the friend but to improve their social experience. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Excluding someone could be seen as rude, but the group is clear that they've discussed it and tried other methods. The friend might feel betrayed, but the group's right to set boundaries is valid. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
