It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is part of a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One of their friends' girlfriends has been coming to these gatherings for the last four times. The author and others find her annoying because she dominates conversations, interrupts people, and even makes the author uncomfortable by trying to impose her own stereotypes, especially since the author is gay but not the \"gay best friend\" type. The author is considering confronting their buddy to make game nights guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The author is part of a group where everyone is uncomfortable with the girlfriend's presence. The girlfriend is coming without being invited again, even after the initial approval. The author has tried to be tactful but the girlfriend doesn't take hints. They're considering being direct but in a respectful way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are consent and communication. The friends didn't explicitly say no when the girlfriend first joined, but now they're all uncomfortable. The author's plan is to talk to their buddy privately and suggest changing the dynamic, which is a reasonable approach. However, there's a question of whether it's fair to exclude the girlfriend without her knowing. But the author isn't directly excluding her; they're asking the friend to change the arrangement. \n\nAnother angle: the author's lie about not having female friends. While that might be a stretch, it's a personal choice to manage boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author and others want their group time to be enjoyable again. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to address a problem that affects the group. The alternative is to continue suffering through unpleasant gatherings. The approach is to communicate with the friend rather than just exclude the girlfriend without explanation. The answer might depend on whether the method is appropriate. The author is planning to be nice and respectful, so it's not about being mean. \n\nBut is it the author's place to make this decision? If the group collectively agrees, then it's a group decision. The author isn't acting alone but is representing the group's sentiment. The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior making the event unpleasant for others. \n\nThe user is probably looking for a moral judgment. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to restore the group's original dynamic. The answer might lean towards B (No, not in the wrong) because the group is trying to address a legitimate issue through communication. However, some might argue that they should have handled it differently, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n"
