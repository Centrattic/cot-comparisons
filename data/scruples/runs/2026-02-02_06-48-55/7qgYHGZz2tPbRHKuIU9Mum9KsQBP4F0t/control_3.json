It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the girlfriend has been coming for four times, making the group uncomfortable. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, and making personal issues for the author, especially with her trying to push him into being the \"gay BFF\" despite his discomfort. The group has talked about it and wants to tell the friend that they prefer it to be guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The author is part of a small group that used to enjoy their game nights, but the girlfriend's presence has changed that. The key points are that the group collectively is unhappy, they've discussed it, and they want to address it directly. The author's plan is to be tactful but straightforward, suggesting a change in the group dynamic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group is making a collective decision. The author isn't acting alone; others are in agreement. The issue is that the girlfriend's behavior is affecting their experience. The author's approach is to communicate this to the friend, which is a common way to handle such situations. However, there's a potential for hurt feelings, but the group is trying to be respectful by offering an alternative (a separate get-together for the couple).\n\nThe main ethical consideration is whether the group has the right to exclude the girlfriend. Since the game night was originally a guys-only group, adding someone without considering the group's comfort might be an issue. The author is now trying to correct that by communicating their discomfort. The friend might feel betrayed, but the group is being honest about their preference. The author isn't doing it out of malice but to restore the original dynamic of the group.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the group is addressing their collective discomfort in a respectful manner, and the author is part of that effort. They are not targeting the girlfriend for being her, but addressing behaviors that make the group uncomfortable. The key here is that they are communicating their boundaries, which is a valid social action.\n"
