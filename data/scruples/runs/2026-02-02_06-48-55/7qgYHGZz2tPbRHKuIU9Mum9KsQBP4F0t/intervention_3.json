It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come to game night. The scenario is that the girlfriend is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author wants to confront the friend directly and politely.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group has a monthly game night that's been a highlight for the author. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four months, which was initially okay but now is causing issues. The main problems are that she's overly talkative, talks over others, and makes the author uncomfortable by stereotyping and invading personal space. The author lies about not having female friends to set boundaries, but she doesn't take the hint. The rest of the group agrees she's not wanted.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention is to communicate the group's discomfort to the friend. They plan to be polite, mentioning the group dynamic has changed and suggest a different arrangement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a legitimate issue that's affecting their social group. They've tried to be tactful, even lying to set boundaries but to no avail. The group consensus is that she's not wanted. The author is acting in the group's interest to restore their enjoyable activity.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a risk of hurting the friend's feelings and potentially damaging the friendship. The author is bypassing the friend's input without giving him the chance to address the situation, maybe. But the author mentions that the group has already discussed it and none of them like her. They might not want to confront the friend directly but feel it's necessary for their own well-being.\n\nAlso, the author is gay and the girlfriend's behavior is making him uncomfortable by trying to force him into a stereotype. This adds another layer of personal distress. The author's actions could prevent further harassment from the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The action is to communicate the group's feelings directly. While it's done with the intention to be kind, it's still a difficult conversation. The author isn't being malicious but is trying to protect their group's social experience. So, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
