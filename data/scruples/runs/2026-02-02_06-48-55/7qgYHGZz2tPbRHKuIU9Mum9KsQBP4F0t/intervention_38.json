It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who don't like the girlfriend joining their game night. The author wants to tell their buddy that the group prefers it to be guys-only now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friends have talked about it and agree they don't like the girlfriend there. The girlfriend is described as annoying, interrupting, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push their gay stereotype. The author is considering being direct with the friend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group has a right to set boundaries for their social time. If the girlfriend's presence is making the group uncomfortable, they might have a valid reason to exclude her. But, the way to handle it matters. The author plans to be nice and suggest a different arrangement. However, the author is considering just telling the friend directly without the friend's input. Maybe they should have tried to talk to the girlfriend first? Or maybe the friend should be informed about the group's feelings. \n\nBut the author's main issue is that the group doesn't want her there, and they can't find a way to tell the friend. The author's approach seems to be the most direct. Is that wrong? If the group collectively agrees, then it's their right to set the terms for their gathering. The problem might be that the author isn't considering the friend's perspective, but the friend's girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment. \n\nSo, if the group wants to exclude her, and they do it respectfully, that might be justified. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for the group's preferences. However, they should ensure that their approach is kind and gives the friend a chance to adjust. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the group has the right to set boundaries for their social events. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to maintain the group's dynamic. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so the exclusion isn't based on prejudice but on the group's comfort.\n"
