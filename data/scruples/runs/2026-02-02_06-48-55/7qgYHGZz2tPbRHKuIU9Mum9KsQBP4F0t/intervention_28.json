It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night that's been a highlight for them. The friend's girlfriend has been coming four times, making the game nights unpleasant for everyone else. She's described as attention-seeking, interruptive, and even made an inappropriate move by showing up uninvited at a gay bar. The author is considering telling the friend that the group prefers it to be guys-only now.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics between the group and the girlfriend's behavior. The group doesn't want her there, but the problem is how to approach the friend. The author is leaning towards being direct and honest, which could be seen as a good approach because it's upfront. However, the ethical consideration is whether they have a right to exclude her without the friend's knowledge, especially since he asked her to come initially. \n\nBut wait, the friend might not be aware of how his girlfriend is affecting the group. The group has discussed it, so they're all on the same page. The author's approach is to be honest but kind, which is a responsible way to handle it. However, there's a risk of damaging the friendship if the friend feels betrayed. But if the group isn't happy, it's their right to set boundaries. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to maintain their social group's comfort and enjoyment. \n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's actions. She's been overstepping, which the group has tried to address politely. Since she's not taking hints, the group has the right to protect their space. The author isn't excluding her out of spite but because her presence is making the group uncomfortable. So, the action is about maintaining their own enjoyment and safety in social interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking responsibility to communicate honestly with a friend to resolve an issue that affects everyone negatively. The right to set boundaries in social groups is valid here. So the answer should be B.\n"
