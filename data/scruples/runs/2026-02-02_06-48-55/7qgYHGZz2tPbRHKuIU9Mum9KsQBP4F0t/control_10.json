It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the group has a monthly game night with five friends. They used to enjoy it, but the friend's girlfriend has been attending the last four times and making it unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and being overly touchy-feely with the author, who is gay and doesn't want to be the \"gay best friend.\" The group all agrees they don't like her there but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The group has discussed this, so it's not just one person's opinion. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author is trying to be respectful by suggesting a solution that maintains the relationship but changes the setup. The alternative is to keep pretending to be okay with her presence, which might lead to more discomfort. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with how they approach the friend. Even if the group agrees, confronting the friend directly could damage their friendship. The author's approach is to be nice, but the friend might feel betrayed. Also, the author's personal boundary about not wanting to be the \"gay BFF\" is valid. The girlfriend's behavior was invasive, so the group has a right to set boundaries.\n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to talk to the friend privately first, without the group. However, the group has already discussed it and decided to act. The author's plan is to communicate the group's feelings in a respectful way. The main question is whether it's wrong to prioritize the group's comfort over the couple's inclusion. Since the group is their usual gathering, they might have the right to set such boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain their social group's dynamics and personal boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
