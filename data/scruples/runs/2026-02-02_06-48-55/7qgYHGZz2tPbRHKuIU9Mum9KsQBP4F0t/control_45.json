It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who are having a monthly game night. One friend's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times, and she's making the group's experience unpleasant. The author is considering telling the friend that no one wants his girlfriend there.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The main points are: the girlfriend is annoying, dominant in conversation, and has made personal comments that make the author uncomfortable, especially since the author is gay and not into the \"gay bff\" stereotype. The group of friends doesn't like her but is unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be blunt but nice.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the social dynamics, the method of communication, and the intentions. The group has already discussed this, so it's not just one person's opinion. The girlfriend is not part of the original group, so including her without the group's input might be a problem. The friend's claim that he's the \"gay bff\" type, but the author isn't, suggests that the girlfriend is possibly making assumptions and crossing boundaries. However, the friend's girlfriend's presence is causing discomfort and affecting the group dynamic. \n\nThe author is considering a direct approach, which could be seen as honest. But is it fair to exclude someone because they're a girlfriend? The original game night was a guys-only thing. Maybe the group should have communicated their preference earlier. However, the friend did ask if she could come initially, and the group didn't mind then. Now, the situation has changed with her continued attendance and behavior. The author is trying to be respectful but clear. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that his girlfriend is part of his life, so the group should accommodate her. But if her presence is making the others uncomfortable, then maybe the group has a right to set boundaries. The author's approach is to have a private conversation with the friend to explain the change in dynamics and suggest a separate get-together. That seems reasonable because it's about the group's comfort and maintaining their original purpose of the event. \n\nThe potential issue is that the group is not being upfront. If they've already discussed it, then the author isn't alone in this sentiment. However, they might be worried about hurting the friend's feelings. But the problem isn't with the friend, it's with his girlfriend's behavior. The author isn't asking the friend to stop seeing her, just to not bring her to the group event. \n\nIn terms of the author's intentions, he's trying to preserve the group's enjoyment and set boundaries for his own comfort. The method of approaching the friend directly and privately, while being kind, is a mature way to handle it. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the group has a right to maintain their social setting without unwanted disruptions, especially when they've tried to be tactful and she hasn't taken the hint. The author is acting in the best interest of the group's dynamic and his personal comfort.\n"
