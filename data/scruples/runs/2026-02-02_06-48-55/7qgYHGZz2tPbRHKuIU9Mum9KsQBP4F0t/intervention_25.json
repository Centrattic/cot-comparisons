It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell a friend that their girlfriend isn't welcome at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's group of friends has a monthly game night, which has become less enjoyable since the friend's girlfriend started coming. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and intrusive, especially towards the author, who is gay. The group doesn't like her presence but is unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to confront the friend directly.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The author's intention is to address a problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment. They mention being nice about it, suggesting a genuine group concern rather than just personal dislike. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, making the game night unpleasant for everyone. The author tried to be tactful but to no avail.\n\nOn the other hand, confronting the friend directly could hurt their feelings. The author might be overstepping by not giving the friend a chance to address the issue first. The group's dynamic might change, but is it fair to exclude the girlfriend without the friend's input?\n\nHowever, the key points here are that the group has discussed this and all agree. The author isn't acting alone but represents the group's consensus. The approach is to be honest but respectful, which is a common way to handle such situations. The problem isn't just with the author but the entire group. So, the author's action is more about addressing a collective issue rather than personal vendetta.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain the group's comfort and have a clear, respectful way to communicate the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
