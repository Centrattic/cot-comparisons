It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their friend's girlfriend has been coming to game night, and the group of friends is really bothered by her behavior. The author is considering just being straightforward with the friend to tell him that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is described as very self-centered, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push the gay stereotype on him. The rest of the friends also don't like her, and they all agree but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for considering this approach. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet's break it down. The author's intention is to communicate the group's discomfort and suggest a solution. But is it wrong to do so? Well, the author is part of the group that's being negatively affected. The girlfriend's presence is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author has tried to be polite, even lied to the girlfriend once, but she didn't take the hint. \n\nIn social dynamics, honesty is often considered important, but the way it's delivered matters. The author plans to be \"nice about it,\" which might mitigate the issue. However, there's a risk of hurting the friend's feelings if the message is delivered without enough sensitivity. Also, the group's consensus is that they don't want her there. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment.\n\nBut there's also a potential for the author to be overly direct without considering other approaches. Maybe they should have tried another method first, like having the conversation as a group, or the boyfriend might need to address it with his girlfriend. However, the scenario states that the group has already discussed it and is looking for a way to tell the friend. The author's approach is to be direct but respectful. \n\nAnother angle: the author is gay, and the girlfriend's actions are making them uncomfortable by pushing stereotypes. This adds another layer of personal discomfort beyond just the group's annoyance. The author's right to feel uncomfortable and to seek a solution is valid. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is trying to address a genuine issue that's affecting the group's dynamic and their own well-being. The approach is straightforward but with the intention to be kind. Since the group agrees and the girlfriend hasn't changed her behavior despite hints, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be honest. They are protecting the group's interests and their own comfort. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
