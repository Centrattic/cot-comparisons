It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like their buddy's girlfriend coming to game nights. The author is considering confronting the friend directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and friends have a regular game night, which has become less enjoyable because the girlfriend is being disruptive. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting conversations, and even making the author uncomfortable with her behavior towards him as a gay person. The author and friends have discussed it but are unsure how to tell the friend. The suggested approach is to be direct but nice, explaining that the group dynamic has changed and making it a guys-only night.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the group's social event is their own, and they have the right to set boundaries. If the girlfriend's presence is making the event unenjoyable for them, it's reasonable to address it. The author is planning to communicate this respectfully, not just exclude the friend. The key points here are consent and communication. The group isn't shunning the friend; they're adjusting the event's format. The girlfriend's behavior seems problematic, so the author isn't the one at fault here. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the intention isn't malicious. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
