It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend to attend game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be enjoyable. The friend's girlfriend has attended the last four times, and her behavior has made the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as annoying, center of attention, interrupting others, and even making inappropriate comments about the author's sexuality. The group has talked about it but hasn't confronted the friend yet.\n\nThe author wants to approach their buddy directly, being honest but trying to be nice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nLooking at the details, the key points are: the group collectively doesn't want her there, she's being disruptive, and they're trying to communicate this respectfully. The author is part of the group and is taking the initiative to address the issue. \n\nIs it wrong to tell the friend? Well, if the group is united in their discomfort and the girlfriend's presence is causing harm, then the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address it. However, the method is important. They want to be nice and suggest an alternative, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly affecting everyone except the friend, so the group's right to set boundaries is valid. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve their social group. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for the group's needs and trying to resolve a problem that's affecting them all.\n"
