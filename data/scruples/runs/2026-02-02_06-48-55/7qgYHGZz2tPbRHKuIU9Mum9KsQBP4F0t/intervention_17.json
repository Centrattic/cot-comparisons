It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has monthly game nights, which were once a highlight for the author. Now, the friend's girlfriend has joined four times and made the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as attention-seeking, interruptive, and uncomfortable for the author, especially because of her behavior towards him as a gay man. The group has discussed it, and they all agree, but the friend isn't getting the hint. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only event.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The group is friends, and the girlfriend is not part of the original group. The problem is that her presence is affecting the group's enjoyment. The author's main issue is that she's making the environment uncomfortable and the group wants to maintain their original dynamic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the group is entitled to set boundaries and maintain their comfort. On the other hand, they need to consider the feelings of their friend, who might take it as a personal attack. \n\nThe author's approach is to be direct but polite, suggesting a change in the group dynamic. They mention wanting to be nice and offer an alternative (a couple's night). However, the problem is that they're excluding someone else's partner, which could be seen as harsh. Also, the friend might feel that his partner is being targeted without her knowing, which could lead to conflict.\n\nAnother angle: The author is part of the group that's been discussing this. They've tried to be tactful, but she doesn't get the hint. The author is gay and feels targeted by the girlfriend's behavior, which adds a layer of personal discomfort. The group's decision to exclude her is to protect their own enjoyment and the author's well-being.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own group's comfort? If the group collectively agrees, then it's about setting boundaries. However, the method of communication is important. Approaching the friend directly, as the author plans, is a responsible way because it's not excluding the girlfriend without her boyfriend's knowledge. The author isn't confronting her directly, which might be more problematic.\n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if the girlfriend's presence isn't actually unwelcome by the friend. The group's justification is that they don't like her, but the friend does. There's a risk of straining the friendship if the approach is too blunt. However, the author is trying to be respectful by suggesting an alternative.\n\nIn summary, the group has the right to set their boundaries, and the author's approach is considerate of the friend's feelings. The main issues are the girlfriend's behavior affecting the group's dynamic and the author's discomfort. Since the group has discussed it and is trying to communicate respectfully, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is that they're not being malicious but are trying to maintain their group's original purpose. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
