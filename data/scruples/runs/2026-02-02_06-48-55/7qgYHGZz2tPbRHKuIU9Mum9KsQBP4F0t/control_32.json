It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One of the friends brings his girlfriend four times, and the group is now struggling with her presence. The author is considering confronting their friend to tell him that the group wants to exclude his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The girlfriend's behavior is described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable due to her trying to push the author into being a \"gay BFF\" stereotype. The group has talked about it and doesn't want her there anymore. The author wants to tell their friend that the group dynamic has changed and that they prefer it to be a guys-only night, suggesting a separate gathering for the couple.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The group has discussed the issue and everyone except the boyfriend is uncomfortable. The author is trying to find a polite way to address it. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment, and they want to maintain their game nights without her. The author is not trying to attack the girlfriend directly but is addressing the group dynamic.\n\nHowever, confronting the friend directly could be seen as a breach of trust if the author isn't careful. The friend might feel that the group is rejecting him because of his girlfriend, which could strain their friendship. Also, the author's approach is to be honest but kind, which is a common way to handle such situations. The key here is whether the group has a right to set boundaries for their own social gatherings. Since they're a private group, they can decide who to include. The author isn't trying to be mean but is addressing a real issue that's affecting everyone's enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a better way to approach it. For example, the group could have given the girlfriend more specific feedback or tried to include her in a way that makes her feel welcome, but the description suggests they've tried and failed. The author's plan to talk to the friend privately and suggest a different arrangement seems reasonable. It's about maintaining the group's comfort without being hostile. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address a legitimate problem that's been discussed among the group. They're not targeting the girlfriend personally but the impact she has on the group dynamic. The approach is to communicate the need for a change while still valuing the friend's relationship, just in a different context. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
