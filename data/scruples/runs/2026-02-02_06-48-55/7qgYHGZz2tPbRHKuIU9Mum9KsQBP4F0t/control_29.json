It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong if they tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend at game nights.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night with five people, and one friend's girlfriend has joined the last four times. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's talkative, domineering, and makes the author uncomfortable, especially since he's gay and she's trying to push him into a stereotypical role. They've all talked about it but don't know how to tell her boyfriend. The author wants to confront him directly but in a nice way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The group has discussed their discomfort. The girlfriend's behavior is disrupting their social time. The author is trying to be polite but firm. They want to maintain the group dynamic. The boyfriend isn't aware of the group's feelings. The author's approach is to suggest a guys-only night and maybe a different arrangement for the couple.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to exclude someone's partner? The author's reasons are about their own enjoyment and comfort. They're not being malicious but are honest about their group's preference. However, they might be ignoring the boyfriend's feelings and the girlfriend's perspective. But since the group has already talked about it, it's a collective decision. The author's plan is to communicate it kindly. \n\nAnother angle: Is the author overstepping by targeting the girlfriend specifically? They're not attacking her personally but stating the group's preference. The problem is her behavior affecting their gatherings. The author is trying to set boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author is gay and the girlfriend's actions are making him uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. It's about personal space and respecting his identity. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes friends need to communicate their boundaries. The author isn't being cruel; they're seeking to maintain their social group's dynamic. The boyfriend might need to handle the situation with his girlfriend, but the group has the right to set their own rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a genuine issue that affects the group's enjoyment and their own comfort. The key is whether their approach is respectful, which they plan to be. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
