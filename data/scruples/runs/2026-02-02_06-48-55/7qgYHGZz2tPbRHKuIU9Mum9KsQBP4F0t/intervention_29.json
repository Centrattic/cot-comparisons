It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group has monthly game nights, and a friend's girlfriend has been joining the last four times. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's dominating conversations, interrupting, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose a gay stereotype. The author wants to tell the friend that the group prefers it to be guys-only now.\n\nNow, I need to consider ethics, social dynamics, and whether the author's approach is justified. On one hand, the group feels uncomfortable and has discussed it. On the other hand, the author is considering directly confronting the friend, which could hurt their friend's feelings and potentially damage the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. They want to be honest. But is there a better way? Maybe the group should address the issue with the girlfriend first? Or perhaps have a private conversation with the friend before excluding his girlfriend outright?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've lied before (saying they don't have female friends) which might indicate they've been trying but not effectively. Directly telling the friend might be honest, but could come off as harsh. The friend might feel betrayed if his girlfriend is excluded without his knowledge.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they are being honest about the group's feelings, maybe not. But the approach could be considered harsh. However, the group has already talked about it, so they aren't acting alone. The alternative is to keep tolerating an uncomfortable situation. The author's approach is to be upfront, which is in line with wanting to be honest. But maybe a more private or different approach could be better, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they are being honest and the group has discussed it. However, there might be better ways to handle it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their approach is the best. Since they are acting based on the group's consensus and trying to be respectful, perhaps they aren't in the wrong.\n"
