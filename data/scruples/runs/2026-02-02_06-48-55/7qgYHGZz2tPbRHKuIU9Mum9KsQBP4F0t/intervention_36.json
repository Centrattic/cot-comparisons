It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their buddy that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. The author's group of friends has been having monthly game nights, and the buddy's girlfriend has been attending the last four times. The group finds her annoying, and the author is particularly uncomfortable because she's making him act gay in a way he doesn't want, even though he is gay. They all agree she's not welcome but don't know how to tell their friend.\n\nSo first, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong to want to confront their friend. Let me break this down. The main issue is whether it's right to exclude someone, even if the group is uncomfortable. The author's reasoning is that the girlfriend is ruining the group dynamic, and they're considering being direct. \n\nOn one hand, the group has discussed it and doesn't like her presence. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive, and the author is experiencing specific discomfort due to her actions. They are trying to be polite by offering an alternative (a couple's night). But on the other hand, the author is going behind their friend's back to exclude his girlfriend without his consent. That could damage the friendship if the friend feels betrayed. Also, the author is using a lie (saying they don't have female friends) to push the friend away, which isn't honest. \n\nIs it fair to exclude the girlfriend entirely? The problem might be addressed by talking to the friend first, explaining the issues, and maybe setting boundaries instead of outright exclusion. The author wants to rip off the band-aid, but maybe a more gradual approach, like discussing the specific behaviors that are problematic, would be better. Also, the author is making a judgment about their friend's girlfriend without giving her a chance to improve. \n\nMoreover, the author mentions that the friend's girlfriend is making him feel stereotyped. That's a personal issue that should be addressed directly with her, not by excluding her from the group. The author's approach might solve the immediate problem for the group but could cause long-term harm to the friendship. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for feeling uncomfortable, the method of addressing the issue by directly excluding the girlfriend without the friend's knowledge is likely inconsiderate and could be seen as the author being in the wrong. They should have tried to communicate their concerns to the friend first rather than making unilateral decisions.\n"
