It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong if they tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's usually just them five. One friend's girlfriend has attended four times, and the author and others find her annoying. She's self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes about being gay. The group all agrees they don't like her, but they're hesitant to tell the friend. The author wants to be straightforward, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a different gathering for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider social norms, potential consequences, and ethical considerations. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about the group's feelings. They feel that the game night, which was once a positive experience, has become unpleasant because of the girlfriend's behavior. The group's consensus is that they don't want her there. The author is trying to be respectful by offering an alternative (a different gathering for the couple). \n\nOn the other hand, approaching the friend directly might hurt him. The friend might feel that his girlfriend is being excluded without a fair explanation. The author's method of communication could be seen as harsh if not done tactfully. The author mentions being \"nice about it,\" but even so, there's a risk of damaging the friendship if the friend feels betrayed. Also, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior (like the gay stereotype) adds another layer, but that's a personal issue that should be addressed separately.\n\nAnother angle is the group's responsibility. Since all five friends have discussed it and agree, it's a group decision, not just the author's. However, the author is the one willing to confront the friend. The group's dynamic is important here. If the friend values game night, the author's approach might be necessary to preserve the group's comfort. \n\nPotential issues with the approach: The author might be overstepping if they don't consider the friend's perspective. The friend might want to address the girlfriend's behavior directly instead of excluding her. Also, the author's lie about not having female friends could be problematic if the friend realizes it's a lie, which might erode trust. \n\nIn terms of ethics, being honest is important, but so is respecting others' relationships. The author's intent is to restore the group dynamic, which is valid. However, the method might need more sensitivity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on how they handle it. If they're honest but tactful, respecting the friend's feelings, then maybe not. But if they're blunt and hurtful, it could be wrong. The scenario mentions the author would be nice, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the author's own bias (the gay stereotype issue) could influence their judgment, making the exclusion seem like a personal vendetta rather than a group consensus. \n\nBut since the group all agrees and the author is just the one taking action, the main issue is whether the action itself is wrong. The key points are honesty vs. sensitivity. The author is truthful to the group's feelings, which is justified. The alternative is to let the situation continue, which they've found uncomfortable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for speaking up, especially as they're trying to maintain the group's dynamic. So the answer might be B.\n"
