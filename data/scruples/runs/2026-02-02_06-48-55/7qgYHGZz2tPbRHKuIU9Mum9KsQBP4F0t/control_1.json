It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they confront their friend about his girlfriend not being invited to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's become less enjoyable because the girlfriend is attending. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose her own expectations. The group has discussed it and doesn't want her there, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and respectfully, suggesting a change to a guys-only night.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the group's collective discomfort and the author's intention to communicate this in a respectful manner. The author isn't acting out of malice but to preserve the group's dynamic. However, there's a nuance here. The friend's girlfriend is being excluded, which could be seen as unfair if the group didn't agree to it initially. But the scenario states that the rest of the group has already discussed it and agrees. The author's approach seems considerate, offering to have the friend and his girlfriend meet separately. \n\nPotential issues to consider: Could this be a case of groupthink or bullying? If the author is honest and respectful, it's more about setting boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive, so the group's right to decide their own gatherings might be valid. However, the method of communication matters. If the author approaches the friend directly and respectfully, it's not malicious. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for acting on the group's shared sentiment. Since the group has discussed it and the approach is respectful, the author isn't acting alone but representing the group's consensus. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
