It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The group of friends has been having a monthly game night, which is a close-knit group of five. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, and her behavior is causing issues. She's described as dominating conversations, being inconsiderate, and making the author uncomfortable, especially given the author's sexuality. The group doesn't want to hurt their friend's feelings but is considering being upfront.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the group has already discussed the problem among themselves and agrees she's not wanted. The author wants to approach the friend directly to suggest making it a guys-only night. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to their social space and comfort. The girlfriend's behavior is making the event unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend. The author is trying to address the issue in a respectful way, suggesting an alternative (couple's night), which shows they want to maintain the friendship without excluding the boyfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is single-handedly deciding to confront the friend without knowing if the solution will work. There's a risk of causing conflict with the friend, especially since the boyfriend might not see the issue. Also, the author's approach might be seen as excluding the girlfriend, which could be hurtful. However, the group's comfort is also important, and they've tried being polite without success.\n\nConsidering the details, the author's intention is to restore the group's enjoyment and maintain relationships. They're approaching it respectfully and seeking a compromise. The girlfriend's behavior is the root problem, not the author's intent to address it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate the group's feelings honestly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
