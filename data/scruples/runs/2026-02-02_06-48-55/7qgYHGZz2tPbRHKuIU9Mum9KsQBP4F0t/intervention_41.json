It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user is part of a group that has monthly game nights with five friends. One of the friends brings his girlfriend, and over four times, her presence has made the game night unpleasant. The author and others in the group don't like her because she's very self-centered, interrupts conversations, and is overly touchy with the author, who is gay but not into the \"gay BFF\" type. They've discussed it and want to tell the friend that the group should be guys-only now, maybe a different time for the couple.\n\nThe author is considering bluntly telling the friend to his face. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's perspective. They've tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend is not taking hints. The group has discussed it and agrees they don't want her there. The author wants to be direct but nice. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is making the event unpleasant for the group. If the group is a regular thing, maintaining the dynamic is important for their enjoyment. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend (the boyfriend) might be hurt if he finds out his girlfriend isn't welcome. The author is bypassing the boyfriend and directly suggesting they can't come as a couple. Is there a better way? Like talking to the boyfriend first, maybe through him, to see if he can address it with his girlfriend? But the group has already talked and decided they can't handle it anymore. The author's approach is direct but perhaps a bit harsh if the boyfriend is taken aback. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to be respectful by framing it as the group dynamic changing, not attacking the girlfriend. The alternatives might be to keep pretending, which would be insincere and could lead to resentment. The group has a right to enjoy their time, and if the girlfriend is making it impossible, they have to set boundaries. The author isn't being mean or attacking the girlfriend personally but addressing the group's needs. \n\nPossible issues: The author might not consider the boyfriend's feelings. But if the group has discussed it and all agree, it's a collective decision. The author's method is to be honest but kind. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
