It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell a friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which was a highlight for the author. A friend's girlfriend has attended four times, making the gatherings unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push gay stereotypes on him. The group all agree they don't like her presence but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and honest.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong. But why? Well, the author is part of a group that's all agreed they don't like the girlfriend. The problem is that the girlfriend is making the game night unenjoyable for everyone. The author is considering being the one to tell the friend, but is that wrong?\n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong to exclude someone, even if they're a friend's partner? The group initially agreed to let her come but now it's causing issues. The author's approach is to be honest but direct. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it without being blunt. Also, the author's personal discomfort is valid, especially with the stereotyping and unwanted touch. But is the solution to exclude her entirely? Maybe the friend should be approached with more sensitivity, or perhaps the girlfriend's behavior should be addressed directly.\n\nAnother point: the author mentions lying (saying he doesn't have female friends) to avoid the girlfriend's advances. That's a red flag. Lying might not be the healthiest approach, but it shows how uncomfortable he is. The group's consensus is important here. If everyone agrees, maybe the author isn't wrong to speak up. However, the method could be more tactful. The key is whether the action is justified given the group's shared feelings and the impact on their enjoyment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group is making a collective decision. The author is acting on behalf of the group. However, maybe they should have tried to talk to the girlfriend directly first, but since she didn't take hints, it's reasonable to approach the boyfriend. The answer depends on whether the author's approach is respectful. The proposed message is to make it guys-only and suggest another meeting. That's a possible solution. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the user thinks he is. Hmm. Maybe the user is considering that the author is being too harsh without giving the girlfriend another chance. Alternatively, perhaps the friendship is at risk. But the group's comfort is also important. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the group's shared discomfort is valid, and the author is acting to preserve the group's enjoyment. However, the approach should be as respectful as possible. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address the issue, especially since the girlfriend's behavior is causing problems. So, B.\n"
