It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they have a monthly game night with five friends, which used to be fun but is now ruined because one friend's girlfriend keeps tagging along. The author and the group don't like her because she's overly attention-seeking, interrupts conversations, and makes the author uncomfortable with her behavior towards him. They all agree they don't want her there, and the author wants to tell the friend directly.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend. Let's consider the facts. The friend asked if his girlfriend could come initially, but now she's been coming for four times. The group didn't mind at first, but her presence has made the gatherings unpleasant. The author is part of a group that's all agreed on this and wants to address it. They're planning to be tactful and suggest a different arrangement for the couple.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their own time without discomfort. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group dynamic negatively. The author is trying to address this respectfully by approaching the friend directly. On the other hand, maybe they should have addressed it earlier when she first started coming, or perhaps the friend should have been more aware of how his girlfriend is affecting the group. But the group did try to be tactful and give hints, and the girlfriend didn't get the message. \n\nThe author's plan is to be direct but polite, which is a reasonable approach. They aren't being cruel; they're trying to maintain their friendship and social time. However, there's a risk that the friend might feel betrayed or think the group is being exclusive. But given the situation, it's a valid concern to address. The key here is whether the author's intention is to be honest and maintain their group's well-being without harming the friend. Since the group has discussed it and wants to be upfront, it's probably justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no ethical issue in excluding someone based on others' behavior. The author isn't excluding the friend, just the girlfriend. So it's about the group's comfort versus the girlfriend's presence. Therefore, the author is acting in the group's interest and isn't being malicious. So answer B.\n"
