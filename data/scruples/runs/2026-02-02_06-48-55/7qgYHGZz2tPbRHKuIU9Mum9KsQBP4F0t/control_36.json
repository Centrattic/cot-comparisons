It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group is a close-knit group of five friends who have monthly game nights. The friend's girlfriend has joined four times, but her presence has made the gatherings less enjoyable. She's described as annoying, attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by pushing for a stereotypical gay best friend dynamic. The author tried to be tactful but she doesn't get the hint. The group has discussed it and none like her. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author and the group are being honest about their discomfort. They've tried to be tactful without success. The girlfriend's behavior is negatively affecting their social time. The author wants to address it directly to protect the group's dynamic. That seems reasonable, as people have the right to set boundaries in their social circles.\n\nOn the other hand, confronting the friend might be seen as harsh. The author is considering a direct approach, but even if done nicely, it could hurt the friend's feelings. The friend might feel betrayed or that the group is against his girlfriend. There's a risk of damaging the friendship, though the group's experience is valid.\n\nAlso, the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior is significant. The girlfriend's actions are intrusive and disrespectful, which is a valid reason to want her to not attend. The group is acting to preserve their own enjoyment and respect.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to have the conversation? It's about honesty and setting boundaries. If the author is straightforward but respectful, it's not necessarily wrong. The alternative is to keep the group unhappy and continue the uncomfortable situations. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more tactful way to approach it without directly telling the friend that others don't like his girlfriend. The author's suggested approach is to mention the group dynamic has changed and suggest a guys-only night. That's a plausible explanation without being personal. \n\nSo, the author's intention is to address the problem, which is valid. The method is to communicate the group's preference, which is not inherently wrong. The issue is whether the author's method is appropriate. Since the author is being honest and respectful, and the group is justified in their discomfort, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). The key is that the group has a right to set boundaries for their social events, and the author is acting to protect the group's interests.\n"
