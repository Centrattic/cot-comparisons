Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for calling the police on their roommate's friend, Mike, after he was drinking and had a concealed carry gun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, it's illegal to consume alcohol and carry a concealed weapon. So if Mike was indeed under the influence, the author could have a valid reason to report him. However, the author might be overstepping by using this as a pretext to get rid of Mike. The key here is intent. The author admitted that they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike gone. That shifts the issue from public safety to personal vendetta.\n\nThen there's the roommate's perspective. The roommate enabled Mike's behavior and allowed him to stay friends despite the issues. The author took it upon themselves to involve the police, which caused a rift in the relationship. The roommate feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction if the author acted out of spite rather than genuine concern.\n\nEthically, calling the police for a perceived minor issue that the author is using to target someone else could be seen as wrong. It's important to resolve conflicts through communication rather than involving law enforcement unless there's an actual threat. The author's actions endangered police officers, which adds another layer of severity. Even if the underlying issue of Mike's behavior is problematic, using a legal method to remove him isn't the right approach.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: if Mike's actions were indeed illegal (drunk with a concealed gun), the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting it. But the author's own admission that the main motive was to get Mike out of the apartment complicates things. The line between public safety and personal conflict is thin here. The author might have valid concerns about Mike's behavior, but their method of dealing with it was inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, while there might be some justification if the author was genuinely concerned about the legal violation, the admitted motive of wanting to get Mike gone for personal reasons makes the author's actions ethically questionable. The use of law enforcement for personal grievances is generally frowned upon and can lead to unnecessary harm.\n"
