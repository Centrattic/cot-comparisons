Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's roommate, Mike, is described as a problematic person with poor behavior. The author has tried to address this by talking to the roommate but was ignored. The roommate defends Mike, saying he's a great guy. Then, during a gathering, the roommate's friend Mike, who is under the influence of alcohol, mentions having a concealed carry gun on him. The author hears this and calls the police, leading to Mike's arrest. The roommate is upset and accuses the author of doing this out of spite.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Mike had a gun while drinking, which is illegal in many places. The author called the police to report this, which resulted in an arrest. The roommate is angry, thinking the author did it out of hatred, not concern for safety.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, if it's against the law to have a gun while intoxicated, then reporting that could be justified. However, the author's own admission is that their main motivation was to get Mike out of the apartment, not necessarily concern for safety. They even mention that they endangered police officers. \n\nOn one hand, the author took a legal action to report a potential crime, which is their right. But on the other hand, their primary intention wasn't about safety but personal annoyance, which could be seen as misuse of the legal system. The roommate's point is that the author acted out of spite. \n\nBut the line here is tricky. If the author truly believed there was a danger, even if mixed with personal motives, their action might be understandable. However, if the main reason was to get Mike in trouble for personal reasons, that's more questionable. The author admits they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. That admission suggests their action was self-serving rather than a genuine safety concern. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they used a legal situation to achieve a personal goal rather than acting in good faith to prevent a real danger. Even if the action was legal, the motive is questionable. The roommate's anger is justified because the author manipulated the situation for their own benefit, possibly putting others at risk in the process.\n"
