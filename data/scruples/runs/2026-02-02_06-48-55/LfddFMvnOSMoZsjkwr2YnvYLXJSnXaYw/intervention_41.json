Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. The situation involves a lot of annoying and possibly illegal behavior from Mike, a friend of the roommate.\n\nFirst, Mike's behavior seems really problematic. He does things like spilling drinks, messing with the roommate's Xbox, being unhygienic, and even putting a whole roll of toilet paper in the toilet. The roommate defends Mike and refuses to keep him out. Then, after a conversation about Mike having a gun while drinking, the author calls the police to get Mike arrested. The roommate is upset, thinking the author is just trying to get rid of Mike out of spite.\n\nNow, the key points here are legality and intent. In many places, it's illegal to possess a concealed firearm while under the influence of alcohol. If Mike had a gun and was drinking, the author might have had a legitimate reason to report it. However, the author's own admission is that their main motivation was to get Mike out of the apartment, not genuine concern for public safety. They even admit that they didn't really care about the gun and ended up endangering police officers. That's a major red flag. \n\nCalling the police to get someone arrested for a potential crime is a serious action. If the author's primary motive was personal vendetta rather than genuine public safety, then they might be in the wrong. Even if there was a valid legal issue, the method of addressing it could be problematic if it's seen as a misuse of police resources or an attempt to harass someone. \n\nAlso, the roommate's reaction\u2014that the author only called the cops out of irrational hate\u2014adds another layer. If the author's actions were more about personal dislike than a real threat, then they might be at fault. The fact that they endangered police officers (maybe by creating a false situation) could make their actions more malicious.\n\nOn the flip side, if Mike was indeed in violation of the law (drunk with a concealed weapon), then the author might have a point in reporting it. But the author's own admission about not caring about the gun and just wanting Mike gone undermines that. \n\nSo considering all this, the author's intent seems questionable. They used a legal issue as a pretext for their personal annoyance, which can be seen as the wrong thing to do. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
