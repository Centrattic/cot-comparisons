Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who called the police) is in the wrong. So first, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe roommate's friend, Mike, is described as very inconsiderate and rude. He's done things like spilling drinks, deleting games, being messy, and even dropping a full toilet paper roll into the toilet. The roommate defends Mike, saying he's a great guy. The author, frustrated, wants Mike to stop coming over but the roommate refuses.\n\nThen, during a party, Mike drinks alcohol and mentions having his concealed carry gun on him. The author hears this, decides to call the police, pretending to go for a walk to do so. The result is Mike gets arrested, and the roommate is upset, accusing the author of snitching and acting out of spite. The author now questions if they did the right thing, considering they might not have been motivated by concern for safety but just wanting Mike gone, and maybe even endangered the police.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to call the police? Was Mike actually violating the law? In many places, having a concealed carry permit allows someone to carry a gun, but if they're under the influence, that could be illegal. So if Mike was drunk and had a gun, the author might be justified in reporting that. However, the author's own admission that their motivation wasn't just about safety but also about getting rid of Mike complicates things.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author's actions were necessary. Maybe they could have addressed it differently, like confronting Mike directly first. But given Mike's past behavior, the author might feel justified in seeking external help. However, using the police as a threat to enforce their own rules could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the potential danger to police if there was a misunderstanding. If Mike was legally carrying the gun, the police might have been put at risk unnecessarily. The author's own doubt here is important\u2014they mention they endangered the officers. That suggests they might have acted impulsively without verifying the situation fully.\n\nThe roommate's reaction is also a factor. The author's action disrupted their relationship, which adds to the complexity. The roommate might feel betrayed, even if Mike was in the wrong. The author's method of resolving the conflict (calling the police) might not be the best approach, especially if there were other ways to handle it without legal consequences.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the author had some valid reasons due to Mike's past behavior and the potential legal issue with a drunk person carrying a gun. However, their primary motivation might have been personal frustration, and the method of calling the police could be seen as excessive or manipulative. The line between self-defense/protecting property and using the law as a tool for personal vendettas is thin here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author admitted they weren't entirely motivated by safety and maybe acted out of spite, that suggests they might be in the wrong. Also, using the police in a way that could endanger others or create unnecessary legal issues might tip the scales towards them being at fault.\n"
