Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their roommate's friend, Mike, who was drunk and had a concealed carry gun. The author's roommate is upset because they feel the author snitched, and the author is questioning their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., open carry laws vary by state, but concealed carry permits generally allow individuals to carry a concealed weapon, provided they follow the laws of the state. However, if someone is under the influence of alcohol and carrying a gun, that might be a separate issue. Some states have laws against being under the influence while possessing a firearm. So the author might have had a legitimate reason to report that, depending on local laws.\n\nBut the problem here is the author's intent. The author mentions that they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. They also admit to potentially endangering police. This raises questions about their motives. If the call was made out of spite rather than genuine concern for safety, that could be seen as malicious.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using the legal system to get someone in trouble for something that might not be a crime (if Mike had a valid permit and the alcohol wasn't a factor) could be considered wrong. The author's roommate might feel that this was an overreaction, especially if the main issue was Mike's annoying behavior rather than a real threat. The author also took a drastic action without resolving the issue through communication first, which could be seen as escalation rather than problem-solving.\n\nHowever, if there was a genuine safety concern\u2014like Mike being drunk with a gun\u2014it's a different matter. The line here is whether the author overstepped by using the law as a tool for personal grievances. Given that the author admits they were more about getting rid of Mike than actual safety, it leans towards them being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the impact on the situation: the roommate is now upset, and the author might have caused unnecessary legal trouble for Mike. Even if the law technically allowed the call, the social and personal repercussions suggest that the action was taken inconsiderately.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author's primary motivation seems to be personal annoyance rather than a legitimate safety concern. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
