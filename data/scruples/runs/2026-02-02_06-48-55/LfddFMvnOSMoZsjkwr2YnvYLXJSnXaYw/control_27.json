Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Mike is a problematic friend of the roommate. He does a bunch of annoying and inconsiderate things, like spilling drinks, messing with the roommate's stuff, and the toilet paper incident. The roommate keeps inviting Mike over despite the author's complaints. Then, when Mike is there drinking and mentions having a concealed carry gun, the author calls the police to get him arrested for drinking alcohol and having a gun.\n\nThe author is conflicted, thinking maybe they acted out of spite rather than concern for safety. The roommate is angry, saying the author snitched out of hate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? Legally, in many places, it's illegal to have a concealed weapon while under the influence of alcohol. If Mike was indeed drunk and had a gun, the author is within their rights to report that. The law is clear on that. But the author's motivation is in question. They admit they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike out. So maybe there's an intent to harm or get revenge.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce the law to remove someone they find intolerable. On the other hand, using a legal technicality for personal vendetta could be seen as misuse of the justice system. Also, calling the police in this situation might have been an overreaction if Mike wasn't actually a threat. The police were endangered, which is a serious consequence.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, if the author truthfully reported a potential violation, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they lied or exaggerated the situation to get Mike arrested, that's different. The story says the author heard Mike mention having a concealed carry gun while drinking, so if that's accurate, the report is legitimate. But if the author was lying to get him in trouble, that's a problem.\n\nThe roommate's perspective is that the author is being irrational and using the law as a weapon. The author's own admission that they weren't concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike out suggests a personal vendetta. That's a key point. Even if the action was technically legal, the intent might be morally questionable.\n\nSo, in terms of legal responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong if they reported a genuine violation. However, morally, using the police for personal reasons without a genuine concern for safety could make them an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the intent and whether the report was a legitimate concern or a prank.\n\nGiven the author's own doubts and the fact that they admit their motivation was to get Mike out rather than safety, this could be seen as misuse of the legal system. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
