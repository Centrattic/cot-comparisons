Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their roommate's friend was in the wrong. The scenario involves Mike, who has a history of annoying and destructive behavior. The roommate enables Mike, and the author tries to get him kicked out by calling 911 when Mike mentions having a gun while drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If Mike was indeed under the influence and had a concealed carry permit, there might be laws against carrying a firearm while intoxicated. But in many places, as long as you're not actively impaired to the point of being unable to handle the weapon safely, it might not be illegal. The author's intent here is questionable\u2014was it a legitimate safety concern or a prank?\n\nThe author admits they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. That suggests the call might have been malicious. Even if there's a legal basis, the intent matters. If the call was made to get Mike arrested without genuine threat, it's likely a false report, which is illegal. Also, endangering police officers by making a false call is a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author believed there was a real risk, even if mistaken, maybe there's some justification. But the key points are Mike's actions (drunk with a gun) and the author's admission of wanting Mike out. The roommate's frustration makes sense because the author's actions led to legal trouble for Mike without resolving the underlying issue. The author might be in the wrong for using the police to solve a personal conflict rather than addressing it through proper channels like talking to the roommate or landlord.\n"
