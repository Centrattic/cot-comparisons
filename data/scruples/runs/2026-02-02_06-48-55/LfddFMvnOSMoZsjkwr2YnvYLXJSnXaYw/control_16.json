Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about their roommate's friend, Mike, who's really rude and destructive. The roommate enables Mike's behavior, and the author is fed up. Then, when Mike is drinking and mentions having a gun, the author calls the police, leading to Mike getting arrested. Now the roommate is angry, and the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. Mike's behavior is clearly inappropriate and inconsiderate, as described. The author has tried to talk to the roommate but didn't get support. The key event is when Mike is under the influence and has a concealed carry permit. The author calls 911, which results in Mike's arrest. The roommate argues that the author was motivated by personal dislike rather than genuine concern for safety.\n\nThe main issue here is whether calling the police was the right action. Legally, it's a crime to possess a firearm while under the influence of alcohol in many jurisdictions. If the author knew Mike was drunk and had a gun, reporting it could be a responsible action. However, if the author's primary motivation was to get Mike in trouble rather than genuine safety concerns, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author admits they were not really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. This complicates things. Even if the action was legally justified (if it's illegal to have a gun while drunk), doing it for personal reasons might still be morally questionable. The author may have endangered police officers, which adds another layer of responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is enabling Mike's bad behavior and not protecting the shared living space. The author felt they had no other recourse. However, using the law as a tool for personal vendettas is generally frowned upon. \n\nSo, the author's action might have been legally correct but morally wrong due to the intent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering both legal and ethical aspects. Since the author's main motive was to get rid of Mike rather than safety, it's more likely they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
