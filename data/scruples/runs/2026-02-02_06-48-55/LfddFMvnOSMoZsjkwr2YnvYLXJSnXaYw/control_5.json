Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves getting the roommate's friend arrested for having a gun while drunk. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The roommate's friend, Mike, has a history of being a terrible guest\u2014spilling stuff, messing with belongings, etc. The roommate is okay with Mike being around, but the author wants him out. After Mike mentions having a concealed carry gun during a drinking session, the author calls the police, leading to Mike's arrest. Now the roommate is upset, accusing the author of snitching and not caring about actual danger.\n\nThe key points here are the legality of calling the police and the author's motives. Legally, in many places, it's against the law to possess a firearm while under the influence of alcohol. So the author might have had a valid reason to report Mike. However, the roommate feels betrayed and believes the author's main motive was personal dislike rather than safety.\n\nBut the author admits that they weren't actually concerned about the gun's danger but wanted Mike gone. That complicates things. Even if the action was legal, the intent might be seen as vindictive. Also, involving the police in a social situation can lead to legal consequences, even if the initial report is true. The author might have overstepped by using the legal system to remove someone they dislike, which could be considered an abuse of the system.\n\nAnother angle is the roommate's responsibility. If the roommate is okay with Mike's behavior, the author might have overreacted. However, the roommate's enablement of Mike's actions could be a separate issue. But in terms of the arrest itself, the author's action was technically legal, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Yet, the motivation is questionable. Even if the act was legal, using the police as a tool for personal vendettas isn't right. The author's admission that their primary motive was to get Mike out rather than safety concerns might make them the asshole for using the law as a weapon rather than a genuine concern for public safety.\n\nAlso, the part about endangering police officers: if the call led to a dangerous situation because Mike had a gun, but the author wasn't genuinely concerned, that adds another layer. But the author might be overestimating the danger. However, the act of calling 911 is a serious matter and shouldn't be taken lightly, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the intent is considered malicious. If the author's main goal was to get Mike gone, not out of safety, then it's manipulative. The roommate's enablement is a problem, but the author's method might be inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they used the legal system for personal reasons rather than a genuine safety concern.\n"
