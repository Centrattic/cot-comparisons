Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by calling the police on their roommate's friend, Mike. The situation involves Mike being extremely annoying and rude, and the author felt pushed to get him arrested when Mike was drinking and had a concealed carry gun.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality. In the US, carrying a concealed weapon is legal under certain conditions. However, if someone is under the influence of alcohol while carrying a firearm, that's a criminal offense. The author heard Mike mention having his gun on him during a drinking session. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might have a valid reason to report this. But wait, the author had personal grievances with Mike, which might have influenced their decision.\n\nNext, the roommate enables Mike's behavior. The author tried to address the issue before, but the roommate didn't take action. The author's frustration likely led them to take matters into their own hands. However, using the threat of arrest as a way to get rid of someone they dislike could be seen as misuse of the legal system. The key question is intent: was the call to the police genuinely about public safety, or was it a way to get rid of Mike due to his annoying behavior?\n\nThe author admits they might have called out of \"irrational hate\" rather than genuine concern for the gun situation. They even endangered police officers, which is a serious consideration. If the call was a prank or done without evidence, it's illegal and unethical. But if there was a genuine belief that Mike was violating the law by having a gun while drunk, then it's a valid report. However, the author's history with Mike complicates this.\n\nIn legal terms, falsely reporting someone with intent to deceive is a crime. If the author knew Mike was not violating the law but still reported him to get him arrested, that's wrong. But if there was a reasonable belief that Mike was in violation, it might be justified. The problem here is that the author's admission that their main motivation wasn't the gun but wanting Mike gone suggests bad faith. Intentionally misusing the police to remove someone they dislike, even if they are a jerk, crosses a line. It's a form of vigilantism and can have serious consequences for others involved, like the police officers.\n\nSo, the author's actions were probably driven by personal vendetta rather than legitimate safety concerns, making them the one in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
