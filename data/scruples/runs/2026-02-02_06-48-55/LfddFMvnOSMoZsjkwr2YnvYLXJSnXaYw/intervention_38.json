Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by calling the police on Mike, their roommate's friend. The situation involves Mike being described as annoying and disrespectful, but the key action here is calling the cops when Mike, who was drinking, had a concealed carry permit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone is legally allowed to carry a concealed weapon, even while drinking, it might depend on the specific law. For example, in some places, being under the influence while carrying a firearm could be a legal issue, but others might not have that as a strict rule. If Mike had a valid permit and wasn't in a prohibited area, then the author's action might be legally questionable. However, if Mike was drinking and had a gun, that could be a public safety concern, depending on local laws.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author's motivation seems to be frustration with Mike's behavior and wanting him to stop hanging around. But using the police as a tool to remove Mike might be seen as an overreaction. The author admits they weren't primarily concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. This could be seen as using a legal system in a way that's more about personal conflict than public safety, which is ethically problematic.\n\nThen there's the roommate's reaction. The roommate is upset because the author called the police, and the author's explanation of danger is countered by the roommate's claim that the author was acting out of hate. The roommate's perspective is that the action was taken to get rid of Mike, not for safety. This suggests that the author's intent might not have been as justified as they thought.\n\nAlso, the potential danger to police officers mentioned implies that the situation could have escalated unnecessarily. If the call was based on a misunderstanding or personal vendetta rather than a genuine threat, it's a misuse of law enforcement resources and could put officers at risk.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have addressed the issue through communication first, like talking to the roommate again or setting boundaries without involving the police. Using legal means as a personal weapon might not be the right approach, even if the person being reported has a history of bad behavior.\n\nSo weighing all these factors: legal validity of the action, ethical implications, intent behind the call, and the impact on relationships and law enforcement, it seems the author acted inconsiderately and perhaps inappropriately, making them at least partially responsible for the situation.\n"
