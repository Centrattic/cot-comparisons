Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their roommate's friend was wrong. The situation involves a friend, Mike, who's described as a problematic guest. The author mentions several instances where Mike behaves inappropriately, like spilling drinks, deleting game data, and the toilet paper incident. The roommate enables Mike and refuses to keep him out. Then, during a party, Mike is drinking and mentions having a concealed carry gun. The author calls 911 to get him arrested for drinking while carrying a gun, leading to a conflict with the roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to consume alcohol and carry a concealed weapon. So the author's action might be justified if Mike was indeed violating the law. However, the author admits that their main motivation wasn't safety but getting Mike out of the apartment, which suggests a possible personal vendetta. This could be a problem because calling the police with malicious intent is wrong. The author also mentions endangering police officers, which is a serious consequence. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is to accuse the author of irrational hate, but the author's actions were based on a real legal concern, even if the motivation was partially personal. However, the law is clear on the illegality of drinking and carrying a concealed weapon. So there's a conflict between the legal justification and the personal motive. \n\nAdditionally, the author's behavior in past incidents (like cleaning up after Mike) might indicate a pattern of resentment. Acting out of spite, even with a legal justification, might still be considered wrong. The key here is whether the call was made with legitimate concern for public safety or primarily to get Mike in trouble. Since the author admits the main intent was to get Mike gone, this could taint the action. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, calling the police to report a crime is a citizen's duty, but if done with malicious intent, it could be considered false reporting. That's illegal. The author's admission that they weren't really concerned about the danger, but just wanted Mike out, implies malicious intent. Therefore, even if the situation had legal grounds, the author's true motive makes it wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the action was driven by personal spite rather than genuine public safety, leading to misuse of the legal system.\n"
