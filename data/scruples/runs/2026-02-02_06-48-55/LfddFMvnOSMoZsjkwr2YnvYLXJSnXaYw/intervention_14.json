Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate's friend Mike is described as really annoying and inconsiderate. The writer lists several examples of Mike's bad behavior, like spilling drinks, deleting their Xbox data, eating with hands and wiping on the couch, and throwing a roll of toilet paper down the toilet. The writer talks to their roommate about keeping Mike out, but the roommate refuses, saying Mike is a great guy.\n\nThen there's the incident where Mike is drinking and mentions having a concealed carry gun. The writer hears this from another room, decides to call 911, and goes out for a walk to make the call. The police come, and now the roommate is angry, saying the writer snitched without cause. The writer admits they weren't really concerned about the gun's danger but wanted Mike gone, and maybe endangered police officers.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide based on the facts.\n\nLegally, it's illegal to have a concealed weapon while under the influence of alcohol in many places. So if Mike was indeed drunk with a gun, the writer did the right thing by calling the police. However, the writer's own admission is that their main motive was to get Mike out, not concern for the danger. That's a problem because if they knew Mike was doing something illegal, reporting it is justified. But if their primary motivation was spite and they exaggerated or lied, that's different.\n\nHowever, in this case, the writer didn't lie. They heard Mike mention having the gun while drinking. The writer acted on a legitimate legal issue. The roommate's issue is with the writer's method, not the act itself. Also, the writer might have endangered police if they were lying or if the situation wasn't accurate. But if Mike was actually violating the law, then the call was justified.\n\nBut the writer's own admission is that they weren't really worried about the gun's danger. So maybe the call was based on a misunderstanding. Maybe Mike wasn't drunk enough, or the situation wasn't as clear. The writer could have checked if Mike was actually intoxicated before calling. Instead, they chose to report it immediately, possibly without confirming. That could be reckless and could lead to unnecessary police involvement, which might be why the roommate is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, if the law was being broken, the writer has a responsibility to report it. Even if the motivation was partly to get rid of Mike, the act itself was legal. But calling the police with that intent could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal vendettas, which might be unethical even if technically legal.\n\nSo the writer's action was legal but possibly unethical because their intent was to get Mike out rather than prevent harm. However, the law requires people to report illegal activities. The writer might be in the wrong if their intent was malicious, but the act itself was legal. It's a bit of a grey area. But since they admitted their true motive was spite, that's a problem. So the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their motivation was not about safety but personal dislike, leading to a misuse of the legal system.\n"
