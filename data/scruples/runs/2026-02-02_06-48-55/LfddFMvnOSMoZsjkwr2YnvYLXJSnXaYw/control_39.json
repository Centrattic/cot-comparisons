Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is about a roommate's friend, Mike, who's described as really inconsiderate and annoying. The roommate allows Mike to come over, and the author ends up cleaning up after Mike's messes. After a particularly bad incident with the toilet paper, the author tries to get Mike to stop coming over but the roommate refuses. Then, during a conversation about guns, Mike mentions having his concealed carry gun while drunk, so the author calls the police to get him arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Mike was under the influence and carrying a gun, that's a legal issue. In many places, it's illegal to possess a firearm while intoxicated. So the author reporting that might be justified. However, the author's own admission is that they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike gone. That's a key point. If the intent was malicious, even if the action was technically legal, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nThen there's the roommate's perspective. The roommate might see it as betrayal because they wanted to protect Mike. The author's actions did cause a legal consequence for Mike and possibly put police in danger. The question is whether the author overstepped by using the legal system to remove someone they just didn't like, rather than addressing the issues directly with the roommate without involving law enforcement.\n\nAlso, the author mentions endangering police officers. If the call was a false report, that could be a problem. But if the situation was real (Mike was drunk with a gun), then it's a valid report. The line here is blurry because the author's motivation was more about getting rid of Mike than public safety. So even if the action was legal, the intent might make it morally wrong.\n\nIn terms of right vs wrong, if the author's action was based on a genuine concern for safety, it might be justified. But since they admit it was more about wanting Mike gone, it's more of a personal vendetta. So the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they used the legal system for personal reasons, not genuine safety concerns.\n"
