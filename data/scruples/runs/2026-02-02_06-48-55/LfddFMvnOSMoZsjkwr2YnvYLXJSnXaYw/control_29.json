Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. \n\nFirst, the situation: The roommate's friend, Mike, is described as very inconsiderate and destructive. The author tried to get him to stop visiting, but the roommate refused. Then, during a gathering where Mike mentioned having a concealed carry gun while drinking, the author called the police to get him arrested. The author now feels conflicted because maybe their real motive was to get Mike out, not safety concerns, and now the roommate is angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to call the police, or was it a personal vendetta? In many places, it's illegal to carry a firearm while under the influence of alcohol. If Mike was indeed drinking and had a concealed weapon, the author might have a legitimate safety concern. However, if the author's main motivation was to get rid of Mike rather than safety, that's a different matter. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of false reporting. If the author exaggerated or lied about Mike's actions to get him arrested, that's illegal. However, if Mike was genuinely violating the law (drunk with a gun), then reporting it is within the public's right to do so. \n\nThe author's roommate argues that the call was out of personal dislike, not safety. The author themselves acknowledges that maybe their concern wasn't genuine. So, the question is whether the author misrepresented the situation to the police, which would make them at fault. If they truthfully reported what they heard (Mike having a gun while drunk), then it's a valid report. But if they fabricated details to get an arrest, that's wrong.\n\nIn this case, the author says they heard Mike mention having a concealed carry gun while drinking. If that's accurate and true, then calling the police was a legal and responsible action. However, if the author knew Mike wasn't drunk or didn't have the gun, then it's a false report. The post doesn't clarify if Mike was actually drunk, but the author mentions \"he's drinking,\" which might not necessarily mean he was over the legal limit. Also, some places have different laws about carrying while under the influence, even if not legally drunk.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intent. Even if the action was legally valid, if the primary motive was to annoy or get rid of Mike, and not out of safety concern, some might argue it's unethical. But legally, the right to report a crime is there regardless of intent, as long as the report is truthful and not malicious.\n\nThe author also mentions endangering police officers. If the officers were put in danger because Mike had the gun, then the author's action was justified. However, if the situation was misrepresented, leading officers to believe there was a danger that wasn't real, then the author is at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on the accuracy of the report and the author's intent. Since the post says the author heard Mike mention having the gun while drinking, and assuming that's a true statement, the report was valid. However, the author might have had ulterior motives, which could make them at fault in the eyes of their roommate, but not legally. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong in general. Since the act of reporting a possible crime isn't inherently wrong, even if the motive is questionable, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the report was a false or exaggerated one, then A (in the wrong). The post doesn't confirm if Mike was actually violating the law at that moment. If the author is unsure or misrepresented the situation, then they are at fault. \n\nGiven the information provided, the author might be in the wrong if their report was based on a misunderstanding or personal dislike rather than a genuine safety threat. Since they admit their primary motive was to get Mike out, not safety, this could be seen as malicious intent, making them the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
