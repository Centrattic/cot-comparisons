Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate's friend, Mike, who's described as really annoying and destructive. The roommate enables Mike's behavior, and the author, frustrated, decides to call the police when Mike is drinking and has a concealed carry gun.\n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The user mentions that Mike was drinking and had a gun, which in some places is illegal. If the author's action led to Mike being arrested for that, then maybe it's justified. However, the author admits that their main motivation wasn't concern for the gun but wanting Mike gone. That could be a problem because if the call was made with malicious intent rather than a genuine safety concern, it might be considered wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the legal aspect. In many states, it's illegal to possess alcohol while carrying a concealed weapon. If the author provided accurate information to the police, leading to a lawful arrest, maybe they were in the right. But if they lied or exaggerated to get Mike arrested, that's a different story. The user says they heard the conversation and acted on that, so maybe the information was truthful.\n\nBut the roommate is upset, thinking the author snitched out of spite. The author's own admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike out complicates things. It suggests ulterior motives. Even if the action was legally sound, the intent might make it morally wrong. Also, putting police in danger by possibly providing incorrect info could be a factor, but the user doesn't say they lied.\n\nSo, the key points are: legal justification vs. personal vendetta. If the law was correctly applied, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the main motive was spite and not safety, that could make it wrong. Also, the consequence of endangering officers\u2014if the call was a prank or false, that's definitely wrong. However, the user doesn't mention lying. They just called based on what they heard. \n\nIn some places, it's legal to report such a situation even if you have a grudge. But if the person's intent is to get someone in trouble without a valid reason, that's a problem. The author's own words indicate they were more about getting Mike out than actual safety. So maybe the answer is A, because the intent was not about safety but revenge or irritation, which makes the action wrong, even if the legal outcome was correct.\n"
