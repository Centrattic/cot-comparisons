Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user's roommate, let's call him Mike's friend, has a history of being really annoying and destructive. The roommate enables Mike's behavior. The author tried to ask the roommate to keep Mike out but was refused. Then, during a gathering, Mike mentions having a concealed carry gun while drinking. The author hears this, calls the police, and Mike gets arrested. Now, the roommate is upset, thinking the author snitched without valid reason.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author acted wrongly by calling the police. The key points here are: Did Mike's behavior violate any laws? In many places, having a concealed weapon while intoxicated is illegal. If Mike was indeed under the influence and had a gun, then the author might have had a valid reason to report it. However, the author admits that their main motivation was to get rid of Mike, not necessarily concern for safety. They even mention that they endangered police officers, which is a serious accusation.\n\nBut here's the thing: if Mike was indeed violating the law by having a gun while drunk, then the author was within their right to report it. However, if the author knew that Mike wasn't actually violating the law (maybe he wasn't drinking, or the gun was legal under the circumstances), then it's a different story. The scenario says Mike mentions having the gun on him, but if the author heard the conversation and confirmed he was drinking, then there's a legal issue. But if the author misheard or misrepresented the situation, that's a problem.\n\nThe user's roommate is upset because the author \"snitched,\" but the author believed it was for safety. However, the author's own admission that their main motive was to get rid of Mike, not safety, complicates things. If the call was made out of spite rather than genuine concern for safety, even if there was a legal violation, it could be seen as a wrong move. The danger to police officers is a red flag here. If the police were endangered because of a false report, that's definitely wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors are: 1) Was there a real legal violation? 2) Was the report made in good faith or out of spite? The author admits to a mix of motives. Even if there was a legal issue, if the primary intent was to get Mike in trouble rather than public safety, that's a problem. Also, if the call led to unnecessary police involvement and endangered officers, that's a serious consequence regardless of the initial intent.\n\nIn conclusion, even if there was a legal issue, the author's intent and the consequences of their actions suggest they are in the wrong. The fact that they endangered police officers is a strong point against them. So, the answer is A.\n"
