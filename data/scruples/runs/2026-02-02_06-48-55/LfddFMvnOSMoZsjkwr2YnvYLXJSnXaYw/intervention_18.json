Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who called the police) is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the roommate's friend Mike has a history of annoying and destructive behavior. The author has tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out of their apartment but was refused. Now, when Mike is at the apartment, he's drinking and mentions having a concealed carry gun. The author hears this, calls 911, and the police come. The roommate is upset, saying the author was just trying to get rid of Mike and didn't care about the actual danger.\n\nSo the key points here are: 1. Mike had a gun while drinking. 2. The author called the police based on this. 3. The author's roommate feels it was a personal vendetta. 4. The author possibly endangered police officers.\n\nNow, in many places, it's illegal to have a concealed carry weapon while intoxicated. So the author's action might be justified if Mike was actually violating the law. But the roommate argues that the author's main motive was to get rid of Mike, not safety. \n\nThe author themselves admits that maybe their main concern wasn't the gun but just wanting Mike gone. So there's a mix of motive and legality here. Even if the action was legal (calling the police about a potential law violation), the intent might be questionable. If the primary motive was spite rather than concern for safety, then the action could be seen as wrong. Also, if calling the police endangered others, that's another factor. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, if the author had a legitimate concern about a law being broken, they might have a right to report it. However, if the report was based on a personal vendetta without a genuine threat, that could be problematic. The line between justified and snitching is blurry here. The author's own admission of mixed motives complicates things. \n\nIn conclusion, while the act of calling the police might be legally justified, the primary motive being spite rather than safety makes the action morally questionable. The author might be in the wrong because the intention wasn't purely about safety, which could lead to unnecessary harm and strain relationships.\n"
