Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's roommate has this friend, Mike, who is described as really inconsiderate and destructive. The author has had multiple incidents where Mike messes up their apartment, like spilling drinks, deleting games, eating with hands and making a mess, and throwing a whole roll of toilet paper into the toilet. The roommate keeps inviting Mike over, and the author tries to talk to them about it, but the roommate says they can't control who Mike is.\n\nThen, there's a night when Mike is at the apartment, drinking, and mentions he has a concealed carry gun on him. The author hears this and decides to call the police, pretending to go for a walk. The police come, and Mike ends up getting arrested. Now, the roommate is angry, saying the author snitched out of hate. The author is conflicted, realizing maybe they weren't as concerned about the gun as they thought, just wanted Mike gone, and even endangered the police.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors here. First, Mike's behavior is clearly problematic. The author has legitimate grievances about the mess and destruction. The roommate isn't helping, so the author feels like the only option left is to take drastic action. But the method used was calling the police because Mike had a gun while drinking. \n\nNow, in many places, it's illegal to be under the influence of alcohol and in possession of a firearm. So the author is reporting a potential legal violation. However, the author admits that their main motivation wasn't concern for public safety but a desire to get rid of Mike. That's a key point. If the call to the police was based on a genuine safety concern, it's understandable. But if it was a pretext to remove Mike, it's more of a personal vendetta.\n\nAlso, by calling the police, the author is using legal authorities to handle a personal dispute. While reporting a crime is generally a civic duty, if the report is false or exaggerated, that's a different scenario. The author claims Mike was drinking and had a gun, which might be true, but if the author exaggerated the situation or fabricated parts, that would be bad. The story doesn't mention that the author lied, just that they might have had ulterior motives.\n\nAnother angle is the roommate's reaction. The roommate feels the author overstepped, and the author acknowledges that their main motive was personal. The roommate's enablement of Mike's behavior is also a factor here. The author might feel frustrated and see this as the only way to make the roommate listen.\n\nBut the problem with the author's action is that they took a drastic step without addressing the issue through other means first. Maybe they could have involved a landlord or a mediator instead of calling the police. Also, using the legal system to remove someone from their own home (if Mike is a guest, not a tenant) might be problematic. The author could have faced legal consequences if the call was considered a false report.\n\nIn the end, while Mike's behavior is deplorable, the author's method of dealing with it was extreme and possibly based on personal dislike rather than genuine safety concerns. The author's admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike gone is a red flag. So, even though the intent might have been to stop a potential danger, the underlying motivation was self-serving, which makes the action questionable.\n"
