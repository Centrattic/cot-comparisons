Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) did something wrong by getting their roommate's friend arrested.\n\nFirst, the situation: Mike is described as obnoxious and destructive, doing things like spilling drinks, deleting Xbox content, and putting a whole roll of toilet paper in the toilet. The roommate is okay with Mike being a guest despite these issues. The author tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out but was refused. \n\nThen, during a party, Mike has a concealed carry gun and is drinking. The author hears this, calls the cops to report him for carrying while intoxicated, leading to Mike's arrest. Now, the roommate is upset, saying the author snitched out of spite and not genuine safety concerns. The author is questioning if they were right to do so, especially since they admit they weren't really concerned about the gun's danger but just wanted Mike gone.\n\nKey factors: Was the author justified in calling the police? In many places, carrying a concealed weapon while under the influence is illegal. So, if Mike was indeed drinking and had a gun, the author might have a legal basis to report. However, if the author was motivated by personal dislike rather than safety, it could be seen as malicious. The author admits that their main motivation was wanting Mike out, not concern for the police or public safety. Also, they mention endangering officers, which complicates things.\n\nLegal vs. moral angle: Legally, if the situation was a violation, reporting it isn't wrong. But morally, if it's a setup or done with malice, it's problematic. The roommate's side is that the author acted out of hatred, not safety. The author's own admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun's danger suggests ulterior motives. \n\nAnother point: The author might have overstepped by using a legal violation as a pretext for personal grievances. Even if the act was illegal, using the law as a tool for personal vendettas can be unethical. The police's involvement led to potential danger for officers, which reflects poorly on the author's judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the act of reporting a legal violation isn't inherently wrong, the author's admitted lack of concern for safety and the personal motivation behind the call makes their actions morally questionable. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
