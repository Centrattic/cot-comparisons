Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a roommate's friend, Mike, who is described as very annoying and destructive. The author tried to get Mike arrested by calling 911 when he had a gun while drinking. The roommate is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. Mike's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014spilling drinks, messing with belongings, etc. The roommate enables Mike, which adds to the tension. The author's main issue is trying to get Mike out of the apartment, leading to the phone call to police.\n\nThe legal aspect is important here. If Mike had a concealed carry permit, he's allowed to have a gun, even while drinking. But there's a law against carrying a firearm while under the influence. So the author's action might be legally justified. However, the author admits they were more motivated by wanting Mike out rather than genuine concern for public safety. That could be seen as using the law for personal reasons, which is a problem.\n\nThen there's the consequence: endangering police officers. If the author called the police without a legitimate threat, maybe that's a problem. But if Mike was actually under the influence and carrying a gun, maybe the author was right to act. However, the key point here is intent. The author's primary motive was to get Mike out, not public safety. That's a big red flag because it's using false pretenses to get someone arrested.\n\nAlso, the roommate's perspective matters. The author endangered others (the officers) and violated the roommate's trust by calling the police. The roommate sees it as betrayal, which complicates the situation. Even if Mike's actions were illegal, using that as a pretext for a personal vendetta could be unethical.\n\nSo, even if the author had a legitimate legal issue (like Mike being under the influence with a gun), the primary motivation was to remove Mike, which makes the action wrong. The author didn't address the situation through other means, like legal avenues or confronting the roommate directly, instead opting for a more drastic and potentially unlawful approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
