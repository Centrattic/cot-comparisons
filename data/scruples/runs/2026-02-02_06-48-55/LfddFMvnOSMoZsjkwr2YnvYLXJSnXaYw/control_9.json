Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author calling the police on their roommate's friend, Mike, because Mike had a gun while drinking. The roommate is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to possess a firearm while under the influence of alcohol. If Mike was indeed drinking and had his concealed carry gun with him, the author did the right thing by reporting it. Public safety is a concern here, so preventing someone from having a weapon while intoxicated is a valid reason to involve authorities.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they weren't really concerned about the gun; they just wanted Mike gone. That complicates things. If the author's primary motivation was personal dislike rather than genuine safety concerns, that could be seen as malicious. The police officers might have been endangered if the call was a false alarm. That's a serious issue because it wastes resources and could put officers at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate's friend has a history of destructive behavior, as described. The author tried to address it before by talking to the roommate, but it didn't work. So maybe the author felt desperate and saw this as a way to make Mike leave. However, using the legal system as a tool for personal grievances can be problematic. Even if Mike was acting badly, calling the police to get him arrested might be an overreach unless there was a clear and present danger.\n\nThe roommate's reaction is also a factor. He feels betrayed and thinks the author acted out of hatred. While the roommate's enabling of Mike's behavior is an issue, the author's method of dealing with it could have been handled differently. Maybe confronting the situation without involving law enforcement next time would be better, unless there's an immediate threat.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: legal justification for reporting a drunk person with a gun versus personal vendettas. The author had a legitimate legal issue to report, but their true motivation was to get rid of Mike, which could taint the action. So whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between the valid concern and the personal motive.\n"
