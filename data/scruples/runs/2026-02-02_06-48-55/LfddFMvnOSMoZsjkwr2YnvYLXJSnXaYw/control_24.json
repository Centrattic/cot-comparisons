Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate's friend, Mike, is described as a really obnoxious person who does a lot of inconsiderate things. The author has tried to address this with the roommate but was ignored. Now, during a conversation about Mike having a gun while drinking, the author calls the police to get him arrested. The roommate is upset, saying the author did it out of spite, while the author claims it was for safety.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to report Mike, or was it just to get rid of him? The author mentions that Mike was under the influence and had a concealed carry weapon. Legally, some places have laws about open container of alcohol in public or being under the influence while in possession of a firearm. So maybe the author did have a legitimate reason. However, the intention might be in question. The author admits they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone. That raises the issue of using the law as a tool for personal gain rather than public safety.\n\nBut wait, even if the author was motivated by annoyance, if Mike was actually violating laws, then the action might still be justified. The problem is the author's own admission that their primary motive wasn't safety. That could make it a false report or a snitching for personal reasons. However, the consequences are that the police were endangered, which complicates things.\n\nIn legal terms, if the author knew Mike wasn't committing a crime, then it's a false report. But if there was a real violation (like drinking and having a gun where prohibited), then it's a valid report. The answer might depend on the specific laws in their area. But since the author's intention was more about getting Mike out than safety, that could tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. Also, the roommate feels betrayed, and maybe the author overstepped by involving police in a personal dispute.\n\nSo, considering the mix of legal justification and personal motive, the answer is leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they used the police as a tool to resolve a personal issue rather than a legitimate safety concern. Even if there was a legal violation, the primary intent was to get rid of Mike, which could be seen as misuse of authority. So, the answer is A.\n"
