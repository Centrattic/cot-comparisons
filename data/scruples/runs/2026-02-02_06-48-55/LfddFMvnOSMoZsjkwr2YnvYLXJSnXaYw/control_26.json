Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their roommate's friend, Mike, has been acting really inconsiderate and rude. The author tried to get Mike to stop coming over, but the roommate wouldn't listen. Then, when Mike was there, drinking and mentioning he had a concealed carry gun, the author called the police. Now the roommate is upset, thinking the author snitched just to get rid of Mike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In the US, if someone is drinking and has a gun, that's a problem because it's illegal to be under the influence while carrying a firearm. The author called 911, which is the right thing to do if they believe someone is breaking the law. However, the author admits they might not have been motivated by concern for the officers' safety but rather just wanted Mike to leave. That's a key point. \n\nBut even if the motivation was to get Mike out, if Mike was indeed violating the law by having a gun while drunk, then calling the police is a legal action. The author isn't supposed to know the exact laws, but if they believed there was a violation, reporting it is their duty. However, the article mentions that the author endangered police officers. Maybe they didn't provide accurate information, leading to a dangerous situation for the officers? If the police arrived and it turned out Mike wasn't a threat, that could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the roommate argues that the author acted out of irrational hate. But the author's actions were based on Mike's previous behavior, which was disruptive and inconsiderate. The author felt it was the last straw. However, using the police as a tool to remove someone from the apartment could be seen as misuse of legal resources. \n\nSo, the main points are: 1) Was there a genuine legal violation? If yes, then the author is justified. If not, then maybe not. 2) The author's motivation\u2014personal gain vs. public safety. 3) Did their actions lead to unnecessary police involvement or danger? \n\nIn the US, it's generally legal to report suspected illegal activities. If Mike was indeed violating the law by being drunk with a gun, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author fabricated a situation to get Mike arrested, that's different. The author says Mike mentioned having a concealed carry gun while drinking. If that's a legal violation, then the report is valid. \n\nHowever, the author's admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike gone might make them question their own justification. Using the law as a weapon for personal issues could be problematic. Also, calling the police as a prank or for personal reasons is wrong. \n\nBut in this case, the author heard Mike talking about having a gun while drinking, which is a real concern. Even if the motivation was mixed, the action itself might be justified if there was a real legal issue. The problem is that the author might have misused the situation to achieve a personal goal. \n\nI think the line here is blurry. Legally, if there was a violation, then the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, if they used it as a means to get rid of Mike, it's questionable. But since the question is about being in the wrong, likely the answer is A (Yes) because the author's actions, while possibly legal, were based on personal vendetta rather than genuine safety concerns, leading to misuse of police resources.\n"
