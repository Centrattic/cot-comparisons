Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. \n\nFirst, the background: Mike is described as very inconsiderate and destructive. The author tried to get him to stop coming over, but the roommate wouldn't listen. Then, when Mike was drinking and mentioned having a concealed carry gun, the author called 911. The police arrived, and now the roommate is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether calling the police was justified. Mike was under the influence and had a gun, which could be a public safety concern. However, there's also the aspect of the author's possible ulterior motives. The author admits they weren't really concerned about the gun but just wanted Mike gone. \n\nIn many places, it's illegal to carry a concealed weapon while under the influence of alcohol. If Mike was drinking and had his handgun, the author might have had a valid reason to report it. However, the author's admission that they were more motivated by Mike's annoying behavior than actual safety concerns complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author took a legal action that could prevent a potential danger. On the other hand, using the police to remove someone based on personal annoyance could be seen as an abuse of the system. Also, the roommate feels betrayed, and the author acknowledges that they endangered police officers. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The law might side with the author if they had a genuine safety concern, but the author's own admission that it was more about getting rid of Mike might make their actions seem vindictive. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because their primary motivation wasn't safety but personal dislike, which could be seen as misuse of the legal system.\n"
