Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by getting their roommate's friend arrested. The situation involves Mike, who's described as annoying and destructive. The author tried to talk to their roommate about keeping Mike out but was refused. Then, when Mike was drinking and had a concealed gun, the author called 911 to report him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, it's illegal to have a concealed weapon while under the influence of alcohol. The author's action of reporting Mike might have been a legal move to prevent a dangerous situation. However, the author admits they were more motivated by getting rid of Mike than actual concern for safety, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, there's a difference between preventing a potential crime (which could be seen as responsible) and using a legal technicality to remove someone they dislike (which might be seen as vindictive). The roommate's argument is that the author's action was out of personal dislike, not genuine safety. The author did mention endangering police, which adds another layer of consequence.\n\nI should also think about the context of prior incidents with Mike. If Mike's behavior was really as disruptive as described, maybe the author felt pushed to extreme measures. But the method used was calling the police for a legal violation, which might be seen as misuse of the system if the primary intent wasn't public safety.\n\nIn some legal systems, reporting a crime is a civic duty, even if the person is disliked. However, if the author fabricated reasons or exaggerated the situation, that would be wrong. Here, the author did report a real violation (drunk with a concealed gun), so legally they might be in the right. But the intent to get Mike out of the apartment complicates the moral judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, using the police to address personal grievances could be seen as misuse of authority. The author's roommate might feel betrayed, and the author might have overstepped by involving law enforcement for what they perceive as personal issues.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the answer could hinge on intent. If the author genuinely believed there was a public safety issue, they might not be wrong. But if it was primarily to get rid of Mike, then maybe they are. The author's own admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone suggests the latter. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
