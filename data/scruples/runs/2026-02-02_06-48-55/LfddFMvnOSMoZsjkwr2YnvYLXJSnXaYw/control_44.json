Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate's friend, Mike, who is described as very inconsiderate and rude. The author has tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out, but the roommate wouldn't let them. Then, when Mike is at the house, he's drunk and mentions having a concealed carry gun. The author hears this, calls 911, gets Mike arrested, and now the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the question is whether calling the police was justified. Let's break it down. Mike had a concealed carry permit, so if he's legally allowed to have a gun, then it's okay for him to have it unless it's prohibited under certain circumstances. Now, if Mike is drinking alcohol while carrying a concealed weapon, that could be a problem. In many jurisdictions, open container laws or drinking in public might apply if he's in a public place, but if he's in a private residence, the situation is different. However, even in private, being under the influence while carrying a gun could be a safety issue.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author's main motivation, as they admit, wasn't really about the danger of the gun. They say they were trying to get Mike out of their apartment. So they used the gun and alcohol as an excuse, even though they weren't really concerned about the safety. That's a key point. If the author had a genuine concern about public safety or illegal activity, that's one thing. But if it's a setup or a prank to get Mike arrested, that's another.\n\nAlso, calling the police on someone for a legal activity (if Mike was allowed to carry the gun and was in his own home, or the roommate's home where he was a guest) might be a misuse of police resources. The police were endangered, as the user mentions, which complicates things. If the officer had responded and there was a threat, but if it turned out to be a false alarm based on the author's spite, then that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the roommate's right to have guests. The author tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out, but the roommate said it's their choice. The author didn't get that, but maybe the roommate has a right to have friends over. Using a false or exaggerated threat to get rid of a guest could be seen as interfering with the roommate's rights or privacy.\n\nSo, the author's actions were based on personal dislike and trying to remove Mike, rather than a genuine public safety concern. Even if Mike was doing something illegal, if the author's intent was malicious, then it's problematic. However, if the author had a valid concern, even if not their main motivation, that could be a defense. But since they admitted the primary reason was to get Mike out, that's where the line is drawn.\n\nIn many cases, false reports to law enforcement can lead to charges, like making a false report or obstructing justice. The author might have acted recklessly, endangering police and wasting resources. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
