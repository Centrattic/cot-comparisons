Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their roommate's friend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the roommate's friend, Mike, has a history of being inconsiderate and destructive. The author tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out but was refused. Now, during a gathering, Mike mentions he has a concealed carry gun while drinking. The author hears this, calls the police, leading to Mike's arrest. The roommate is upset, saying the author did it out of spite.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Mike had a history of bad behavior. 2) The author felt their living environment was being violated. 3) The author used the gun situation as a reason to get Mike arrested, but admitted it was more about getting him out.\n\nLegally, calling the police when someone is drinking and has a gun could be justified if there's a risk. However, the author's main motivation wasn't safety but getting rid of Mike. This might taint the action, making it more about personal vendetta than public safety. Also, the roommate's enablement of Mike complicates things. The author's actions might be seen as an overreaction, especially since they were the only one cleaning up after Mike. But Mike's actions (like the toilet paper incident) show a pattern of disregard for others' property.\n\nHowever, the act of calling the police was to prevent a legal violation (drunk with a gun), which is a valid concern. But the author's admission that they were more upset about Mike's behavior than the actual safety might make it look like a snitching move. The roommate's anger is understandable, especially if the author's action put police in danger, as mentioned.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be in the wrong because they used a legal technicality to achieve a personal goal, not because of genuine safety. But if the law was actually being broken, then it's a gray area. The line is between legitimate concern and using the law as a tool for personal gain. The author's own admission that their primary concern wasn't the gun but Mike's presence could tip the scales towards them being in the wrong.\n"
