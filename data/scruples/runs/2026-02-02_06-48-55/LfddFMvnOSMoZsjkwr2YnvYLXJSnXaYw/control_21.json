Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their roommate's friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, Mike, is described as really annoying with some pretty obnoxious behavior\u2014spilling drinks, messing with belongings, being messy in the bathroom. The roommate is okay with this, but the person in the post is the one who always ends up cleaning up.\n\nThen comes the key incident: during a gathering where Mike mentions having a concealed carry gun, the person calls 911 while Mike is presumably under the influence of alcohol. The police are called, leading to Mike's arrest for drunk in public with a weapon. Now the roommate is upset, thinking the person called the cops just to get Mike out, not because of a real safety concern. The person is now questioning if they did the right thing, admitting they were more motivated by wanting Mike gone than actual danger.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are: \n\n1. **Was the person justified in calling the police?** If the law was being broken (like having a gun while intoxicated in public), then maybe they weren't in the wrong. But if it's not illegal, then it's a problem.\n\n2. **Intent vs. Outcome** The person's intention was to get Mike out by using the drunk with a gun angle. But if there was a genuine safety concern, the action could be seen as responsible. However, if it's a false accusation, that's another issue.\n\n3. **Endangering police officers** The person mentions that they might have endangered lives. This is a red flag. If the call to the police was based on a false report, then it's a crime (like making a false police report), which is a serious issue. However, if the person genuinely believed there was a threat, maybe not. But in this case, the person admits they weren't really concerned about the gun, so it's possible the report was exaggerated or false.\n\n4. **Roommate's Perspective** The roommate might have a point if the police were called without legitimate cause. The friend could have been intoxicated, but that doesn't automatically make it illegal. Depending on the jurisdiction, having a gun while intoxicated might not be a crime unless the person is a danger to others. So if the person fabricated the reason for the call, that's an issue.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations** Even if the action was legally permissible, ethically, calling the police to get someone in trouble for something they're not doing (or something that's not a real threat) could be seen as wrong, especially if it's a way to force the roommate's hand.\n\nNow, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user's question hinges on whether the action was justified. The author admits that their primary motive was to make Mike leave, not genuine concern for public safety. Even if there was a legal technicality about the gun and alcohol, the fact that the author's intent was to harm Mike's presence in the apartment could make the call a malicious one. Also, if the police officers were endangered because the situation wasn't as dangerous as the author made it out to be, that's a problem. Legally, if the author made a false report to the police, that's a crime. Ethically, manipulating a law enforcement situation for personal gain (kicking Mike out) is questionable. The roommate's point about it being a false police report based on irrational hate might be valid here.\n\nSo, considering the intent to get Mike out by fabricating or exaggerating a danger, and the potential legal repercussions of a false report, the answer would be A. The author acted unethically and possibly illegally by using the police to deal with a personal annoyance, not a genuine threat.\n"
