Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who called the police on their roommate's friend is in the wrong. The situation starts with Mike being described as really annoying and inconsiderate. The roommate is enabling him, and the narrator feels like the only one cleaning up after him. Then there's the incident where Mike was drinking and had a concealed carry gun. The narrator called the cops, leading to Mike's arrest. Now the roommate is upset, saying the narrator called out of irrational hate, and the narrator is questioning if that's true.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to have a firearm while under the influence of alcohol. So if Mike was indeed drinking and had his concealed carry gun on him, the narrator's call might be justified. But wait, the narrator admits they weren't really concerned about the gun; they just wanted Mike gone. Also, they mention endangering police officers. That could mean they didn't provide enough info or lied to the police, making the situation more dangerous.\n\nThen there's the moral side. Even if Mike was annoying, intentionally getting someone arrested might be crossing a line. The narrator's actions could be seen as prank calling or using a legal technicality to get rid of someone they dislike, which is unethical. The roommate's reaction is also valid because he's upset about the betrayal and the legal trouble for his friend.\n\nBut there's the part where the roommate allowed Mike to stay despite the narrator's complaints. The narrator tried to communicate their discomfort but was ignored. So maybe there's some responsibility on the roommate to protect their roommate's living space. However, the narrator's method of dealing with it was extreme.\n\nThe key here is whether the narrator had a legitimate concern about the gun and alcohol or if they were just trying to get Mike in trouble. Since they admit they weren't really worried about the gun, it seems more like a vendetta. Even if the act of calling the police was technically legal, the intent and the consequences (like endangering officers) make the action morally questionable. So the answer is likely that the narrator is in the wrong.\n"
