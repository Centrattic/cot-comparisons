Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for getting their roommate's friend arrested. The friend, Mike, is described as really annoying with a bunch of inconsiderate behaviors. The roommate keeps inviting Mike over despite the complaints. \n\nThen there's the incident where the author overhears Mike talking about having a concealed carry gun while drinking. The author calls 911 to report him, leading to his arrest. Now, the roommate is upset, and the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to have a concealed weapon while under the influence of alcohol. So if Mike was indeed drinking and carrying a gun, the author might have a legitimate reason to report him. However, the author admits they were more motivated by wanting Mike out of their apartment than genuine concern for safety. They even mention endangering police officers, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, calling the police as a prank or out of spite can have serious consequences. Even if the initial report was based on a real violation, if the intent was to get Mike in trouble for personal reasons, that could be problematic. The author's actions led to an arrest, which might be seen as an overreaction if the primary motive wasn't safety.\n\nThe roommate's reaction is also a factor. The roommate feels betrayed by \"snitching,\" even though the author's actions were based on a real legal issue. However, the author's admission that they weren't primarily concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone suggests ulterior motives.\n\nSo, balancing the legal justification against the personal motive, the author might be partially in the wrong for using the law as a tool for personal grievances. But if the initial report was accurate, there's a legal basis. However, the intent to remove Mike rather than genuine concern could make the author the asshole for exploiting a legal situation for personal gain.\n"
