Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their roommate's friend was in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. The roommate's friend, Mike, is described as very inconsiderate and rude, doing things like spilling drinks, messing with the Xbox, and throwing toilet paper into the toilet. The roommate enables Mike's behavior. After a particularly bad incident, the person tried to talk to the roommate about keeping Mike out, but the roommate refused. \n\nThen, during a party, Mike mentions he has a concealed carry gun and is drinking. The person overhears this and calls the police, leading to Mike's arrest. The roommate now is upset, saying the person did it out of spite, not concern for safety. The person is questioning their own motives, admitting they wanted Mike gone and might have endangered police officers.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether calling the police was justified. Legally, in many places, it's illegal to be under the influence of alcohol and carry a concealed weapon. If Mike was indeed drinking and had a gun, then calling the police could be a legitimate action. However, the person's motivation might be in question. They admit they were more focused on getting Mike out rather than the safety aspect. \n\nBut even if their motive was partly personal, the act itself of reporting a potential illegal activity might still be legally correct. However, using the police for personal reasons could be seen as misuse of police resources. Also, if the person exaggerated or lied about the situation, that would definitely be wrong. But in this case, they just reported what they heard.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate's friend's actions (drinking with a gun) are a legitimate concern. Even if the person was annoyed, the potential danger of an intoxicated person with a gun is real. So there's a valid public safety angle here.\n\nBut the person's own admission that their primary motivation was to get Mike out, not safety, complicates things. It's possible they had good cause to be concerned about safety, given Mike's past behavior, but their personal vendetta might have influenced the decision. \n\nIn terms of the law, if Mike was indeed violating a law (concealed carry while intoxicated), then calling the police is a citizen's duty. However, if the person made a false report or misrepresented facts, that's a problem. The story doesn't mention that they lied, just that they reported what they heard. \n\nThe roommate being angry is understandable because it's a personal conflict. The line between a justified legal action and a personal vendetta is blurry here. The person might have acted on both concerns, but their own admission of not really caring about the gun at the time adds to the question of their intent.\n\nSo, legally, they might not be in the wrong for reporting a possible crime. Morally, if their primary intent was to get Mike out rather than safety, that could make it seem like they're in the wrong. However, the potential danger of an intoxicated person with a gun is a valid public safety issue. The person's actions might have been justified, even if their motives were mixed. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of using the police for personal reasons. That could be seen as wrong because it's a misuse of law enforcement. However, in the US, citizens are generally encouraged to report illegal activities regardless of personal feelings. Unless there was malicious intent or a false report, it's a gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's actions might be legally justified, but morally, there's a question because of their admitted personal motives. The answer could depend on the specific laws in their area regarding reporting crimes and the circumstances under which someone can carry a concealed weapon while drinking. Since the scenario is hypothetical and we don't have all the legal specifics, but based on general principles, the person might not be in the wrong for reporting a potential illegal act, even if their motives were mixed. However, the fact that they admit they were more focused on getting Mike out than the safety aspect could make them at least partially responsible for the conflict with the roommate. The answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because of using the police for personal reasons, but B if it's about legal duty. It's a tough call.\n"
