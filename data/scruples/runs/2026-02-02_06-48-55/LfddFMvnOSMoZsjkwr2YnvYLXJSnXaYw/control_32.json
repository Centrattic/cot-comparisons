Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The roommate's friend, Mike, is described as extremely inconsiderate and destructive. He does things like spilling drinks, messing up the Xbox, eating messily, and even throwing a whole roll of toilet paper into the toilet. The roommate enables Mike, so the author feels like they have to clean up after him.\n\nThen, the main incident: The author overhears Mike talking about having his concealed carry gun while drinking. The author calls the police to report this, leading to Mike's arrest. Now the roommate is upset, thinking the author had bad intentions and only wanted Mike gone. The author is questioning their own motives, realizing maybe they weren't as concerned about the safety as they thought.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to call the police, or were they acting out of spite?\n\nIn the US, it's illegal to be under the influence of alcohol while carrying a concealed weapon. So if Mike was indeed drinking and had his gun on him, the author did the right thing by reporting it. However, the author's own admission that their primary motive was wanting Mike gone, rather than genuine concern for safety, complicates things.\n\nCalling the police in a situation where there's a potential legal violation is generally a civic duty. But if the person making the report has ulterior motives, like wanting to get someone in trouble for personal reasons, that could be problematic. The author seems to acknowledge that their motive might have been more about getting rid of Mike than safety. They also mention endangering police officers, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nHowever, the actual act of reporting a possible illegal activity isn't inherently wrong. The line between a legitimate report and a malicious one depends on intent. If the author believed Mike was breaking the law, even if partially motivated by annoyance, the report could be justified. But if the author lied to the police or exaggerated the situation, that would be different.\n\nIn this case, the author heard Mike mention having the gun while drinking. If that's a factual statement, then the report was truthful. The police would handle it based on their assessment. The author's own doubts about their motives might make them question their actions, but legally, they might not be in the wrong if the report was accurate.\n\nBut socially, the situation is different. The roommate might feel betrayed, and the author's ulterior motives could make others think they acted out of spite. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering both legal and social contexts.\n\nLegally, reporting a possible crime is okay. Socially, the method and intent matter. If the author did this to spitefully get Mike arrested rather than for safety, that's where the moral judgment comes in. The author's own admission that they weren't really concerned about the gun but wanted Mike gone suggests that their social judgment is being questioned.\n\nSo, in terms of AITA, the community might lean towards the author being an asshole if their primary intent was to get Mike in trouble for personal reasons, even if the legal action was technically correct. But technically, the act itself might not be wrong. However, given the mixed motives, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their intent wasn't purely about safety but rather getting rid of someone annoying, which could be seen as malicious.\n"
