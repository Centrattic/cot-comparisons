Mike is a bit of a dick and a horrible guest. He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for getting their roommate's friend arrested. The situation involves Mike's annoying and destructive behavior, leading the author to call the police when Mike had a gun while drinking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, having a concealed carry gun while under the influence of alcohol is illegal. If that's the case here, then the author might have done the right thing legally. However, the author's motivations are in question. They admit they weren't really concerned about the gun's danger but just wanted Mike gone. That could imply ulterior motives, like revenge or spite, which might make the action ethically questionable.\n\nThen there's the roommate's perspective. The roommate is upset because the author called the cops, leading to Mike's arrest. The roommate might feel that the author overstepped by involving the police, especially if there was no immediate danger. The roommate's defense of Mike also suggests that the author's actions might have been a breach of trust or a violation of shared living agreements, even if Mike's behavior was problematic.\n\nThe ethical angle is tricky. While Mike's actions were clearly annoying and inconsiderate, using the law as a tool to get someone arrested for personal reasons can be seen as manipulative. The author's own admission that their main goal was to remove Mike implies that the legal justification might have been a pretext. This could make the author's actions morally wrong, as they used a legal system for personal gain rather than genuine public safety.\n\nAlso, the consequences of the police being endangered are mentioned. If the author's call put officers at risk, that adds another layer of wrongdoing. Even if the initial action was legal, causing unnecessary harm to others could be seen as unethical.\n\nHowever, from a legal standpoint, if the author provided accurate information about Mike having a gun while drinking, the police were doing their job. The author's mistake was likely not verifying the legality of the situation beforehand or considering if there were other ways to address Mike's behavior without involving the law.\n\nIn summary, while Mike's behavior was bad, the author's intent to get him arrested out of spite, rather than a genuine concern for safety, might place them in the wrong. The ethical judgment here hinges on the motivation and the proportionality of the response.\n"
