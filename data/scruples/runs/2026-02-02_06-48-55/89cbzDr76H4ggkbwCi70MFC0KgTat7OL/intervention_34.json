After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them shaming someone for poor hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the person noticed a foul body odor from another player in two consecutive weeks. They tried ignoring it the first time, thinking it was a one-off, but the second time, even the store owner refused to address it. The writer then publicly called out the person, leading to some backlash. The owner and some players were upset, and the person left.\n\nThe key points here are: the writer's approach was public shaming, which can be harsh. They tried to approach the owner first, but he didn't act. The problem persisted, so they took matters into their own hands. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and while it's a valid concern in shared spaces, how you address it matters. Public shaming can be hurtful and may not encourage the person to improve. It could also make the person feel embarrassed instead of motivated to change. The writer might have thought they were helping their friends and others by addressing it, but the method might have been too direct.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner not taking action might have left the writer feeling they had no choice. But instead of confronting the person privately, they went public. That's where the issue might lie. Public shaming can lead to social exclusion and might not be effective. The person who was shamed left quickly, which could mean they felt humiliated rather than corrected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's approach was probably inappropriate. They should have tried to address the person privately first or maybe used a more tactful method. Publicly calling out someone's hygiene in front of others is likely to cause hurt feelings and isn't the most effective way to handle it. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
