After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who posted the AITA question is wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed someone with a very bad body odor during an event. They tried to ignore it initially, assuming it was a one-time mistake. But when it happened again, they went to the owner, who didn't help. Then the problem got worse, leading the author to publicly call out the person, which made them leave. Now, people are divided on whether the author was right or wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: public shaming, the right to address personal issues, and the impact on others. The author's action was loud and public, which might have been harsh even if the intent was good. Hygiene is a personal issue, and while it's a valid concern, the method of addressing it matters. The owner didn't take action, so the author took it upon themselves, but in a way that was direct and possibly humiliating.\n\nI should consider whether there were other ways to handle it. Maybe approaching the person privately first, or working with the owner more effectively. Public shaming can be seen as cruel and might have caused embarrassment. However, the author's friends and others were uncomfortable, and the owner wasn't helping. So the author might have felt they had no choice.\n\nBut is that a valid excuse? Public shaming can damage someone's reputation and self-esteem. It's possible the person had a valid reason, like a medical issue or a difficult situation, and wasn't aware. The author didn't give them the chance to address it privately. Also, the owner's reaction suggests that maybe the approach was inappropriate in the store's context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to create a comfortable environment for everyone. The line between standing up for oneself and being considerate of others' feelings is tricky here. The fact that others were also affected might support the author's stance, but the method was confrontational and public.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might have been in the wrong for choosing a public and harsh method instead of a more private and compassionate approach. However, the situation was uncomfortable for many, so there's some understanding for the author's actions. But overall, the public shaming aspect probably makes the author responsible for the negative outcome.\n"
