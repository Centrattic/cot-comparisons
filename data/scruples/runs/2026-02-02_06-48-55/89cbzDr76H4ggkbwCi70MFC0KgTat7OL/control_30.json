After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story was in the wrong for publicly shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. So, the situation: the person noticed a foul smell, tried to ignore it at first, but when it happened again, they confronted the owner who didn't help, so they publicly called out the person in front of everyone. The guy left, some people appreciated it, but the owner and a few others were upset.\n\nHmm, so the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address a hygiene issue that was affecting others. The smell was so bad that people were stepping outside for fresh air. That's a clear discomfort. The owner didn't help, so the author took matters into their own hands. But they did it publicly, which is where the problem might lie. Public shaming can be harsh, even if the issue is valid.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to create a more comfortable environment for everyone. Hygiene is a personal responsibility, and the person emitting the odor was affecting others. The author's approach might be seen as a justified stand against something unpleasant. But on the other hand, publicly calling someone out in a loud and direct manner could be hurtful and embarrassing. It's possible that the individual had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical issue or a bad day, and the public shaming was overly harsh without giving them a chance to address it privately.\n\nThe owner and some players disapproved because public confrontation isn't always the best approach. Maybe a private conversation would have been more effective. Also, the person in question left quickly, so maybe the message was heard, but at the cost of public humiliation. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, public shaming is generally frowned upon because it can damage someone's dignity. Even if the issue is real, the method of addressing it matters. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned but the approach was confrontational. So, while the problem exists, the way it was handled could be considered inconsiderate or cruel, as one person mentioned. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the issue itself was valid. The answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the public shaming was the problem, not the issue itself.\n"
