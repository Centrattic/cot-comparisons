After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. They had a situation where someone at a Magic: The Gathering event had a strong body odor, and after two weeks of this, the author publicly shamed the person. The owner didn't help, and the author's friends were stepping outside due to the smell. The author then made a loud announcement, which caused the person to leave and got mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and etiquette. Publicly shaming someone, even if the issue is about personal hygiene, can be seen as harsh and potentially humiliating. It's possible that the person had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical issue or a one-time situation. The author tried to get the owner involved first, which is good, but when that didn't work, they took direct action.\n\nBut was there a better way to handle it? Maybe addressing the person privately instead of in front of everyone. Public shaming can lead to embarrassment and might not be the most effective or kind approach. However, the author might have felt that the situation was affecting their experience and others', so they felt compelled to act.\n\nThe owner's reaction and others' disapproval suggest that the method was too confrontational. The key points here are the public nature of the shaming vs. the intent to improve the situation. Even if the intent was good, the method could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author might be in the wrong because a more private and diplomatic approach would have been better.\n"
