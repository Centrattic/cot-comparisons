After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by publicly shaming someone for their hygiene at an MTG event. The scenario involves the author addressing the issue loudly in front of others, which led to the person leaving and some backlash.\n\nFirst, the problem is about poor hygiene. The author tried to talk to the owner first, but the owner didn't help. Then, they took matters into their own hands by publicly calling out the person. Public shaming can be a sensitive issue. Even if the intention was good, the method might be harsh. \n\nThe key points here are the approach and the public nature of the confrontation. The person might have a valid reason for their odor that others don't know about, like a health issue or a difficult situation. Publicly humiliating someone could be seen as cruel, regardless of the justification. The alternative might have been to approach the person privately, maybe with compassion, to avoid embarrassment. \n\nAlso, the owner's reaction suggests that the store had a policy against such confrontations. The author's action might have disrupted the event and made others uncomfortable, even if others initially appreciated it. The person being shamed left quickly, but the impact on their dignity is a factor here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, direct public criticism without a private approach first is often frowned upon. While the hygiene issue is a legitimate concern, the method used could be considered inconsiderate. The author might have been right to address it, but the approach was wrong. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
