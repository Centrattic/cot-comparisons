After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic The Gathering event. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They're at a card shop with friends and other players. The person in question has a foul body odor that's noticeable and causing others to step outside to get fresh air. The owner didn't take action, so the poster publicly called out the individual in a loud and shaming manner, leading the person to leave quickly. Now, people are divided on whether the poster was right or wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me consider the factors involved here.\n\nHygiene is a personal matter, but in public spaces, it can affect others. The person with the odor might have a valid reason, like a medical issue or lack of resources. Publicly shaming someone, even if the intent is to help, can be hurtful and humiliating. The poster tried to address the owner first, which is a good step, but when that failed, they took it to the group. But the method was loud and direct, without private confrontation.\n\nThere's a balance between addressing a problem and respecting someone's dignity. Shaming can be counterproductive, especially if the person doesn't realize their odor is an issue. The owner's reaction and others' disapproval suggest that the approach was too harsh, even if the problem exists. Maybe a better approach would be to address it with the person privately, or find another solution like moving seats, or using air fresheners. Public shaming might lead to social exclusion and could be seen as cruel, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the poster was trying to protect their friends and others from discomfort. The owner's refusal to act might have left them feeling they had to take matters into their own hands. But the method used was confrontational and public, which could be seen as tactless. The key issue here is whether the public shaming was the appropriate response.\n\nConsidering all angles, it seems that while the problem of the odor is valid, the way it was handled was not respectful or considerate of the other person's feelings. So the author is in the wrong because they chose a public and shaming approach instead of a more private and compassionate one. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
