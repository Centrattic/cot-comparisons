After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone over their hygiene at a Magic The Gathering event. The writer says they did it because the body odor was really bad and others were affected. They approached the owner first, but the owner didn't help, so they decided to speak up publicly.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether publicly shaming someone like that is wrong. Well, from a social standpoint, public shaming can be harsh and might not be the best approach. Even if the issue is valid, there are more considerate ways to handle it. For example, maybe approaching the person privately, offering help, or working with the store owner to address it without humiliation. The writer did approach the owner first, but when that didn't work, they went public. But the loud announcement in front of everyone might have been a bit much. The person in question left quickly, so maybe the message got through, but the method could have been more compassionate. The owner's disapproval and others finding it cruel suggest that there's a social expectation to handle such matters more discreetly. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They had good intentions but the method was inappropriate.\n"
