After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene at a Magic The Gathering event. The author tried to talk to the store owner first, but the owner didn't help. Then, in frustration, the author publicly shamed the person, leading to the guy leaving quickly and some backlash.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public shaming versus addressing the issue discreetly. The author's intention was to make the environment more comfortable for everyone, but the method was confrontational and public. Even though the issue was recurring and others were affected, using a loud announcement might have been harsh. The owner and some players felt it was cruel, which suggests that the approach might not have been the best way to handle it. There are better ways, like approaching the person privately or involving the owner in a different manner. Public shaming can be hurtful and may not respect the person's dignity. So, even if the problem was real, the method used was probably not appropriate. The author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the issue existed.\n"
