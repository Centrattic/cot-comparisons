After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for publicly shaming someone over bad hygiene during an MTG event. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed someone's bad odor twice, tried to ignore it, approached the owner who didn't help, and then finally publicly called the person out. They caused the person to leave and got mixed reactions. The owner and some others were upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to hear my take.\n\nSo, the key points here. Public shaming is a strong move. The person tried to handle it privately first by talking to the owner, which is good. But when that didn't work, they went public. But maybe there were other options? Like approaching the person directly but privately? Or maybe suggesting they talk to the person in front of others but in a less confrontational way?\n\nThe main issue here is the method. Publicly calling someone out for their hygiene in front of others could be seen as harsh and embarrassing. Even if the problem existed, the way it was handled might have been unkind. The author's intention was to address the issue, but the method might have breached social boundaries. People often don't respond well to public shaming, and it could have hurt the other person's feelings or dignity. The fact that the owner was upset and others called it cruel suggests that the approach was not well-received.\n\nHowever, the author did try to handle the issue before escalating, so maybe there's some nuance. But in the end, the public confrontation was the problem. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They could have tried to talk to the person privately instead of making a loud announcement.\n"
