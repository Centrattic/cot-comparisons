After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for publicly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. \n\nFirst, the context: The author noticed a strong odor from another player, which affected their experience. They tried ignoring it, approached the owner, but the owner didn't help. Then, in frustration, they publicly called out the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving and some backlash.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Public shaming, even if the issue is unpleasant, can be harsh. While the author had a valid concern about hygiene affecting their enjoyment, the method they used was direct and public. That might have been embarrassing for the person involved. It's possible the person had a legitimate reason for the odor, like a medical issue or financial hardship preventing proper hygiene, but the author didn't address it privately first.\n\nThe owner's refusal to act might have been frustrating, but the author's solution was to confront the issue in a way that publicly humiliated someone. Even if others initially appreciated it, the negative reactions from the owner and some players suggest that the approach was problematic. A better approach might have been to try talking to the person privately or finding another discreet way to address the issue, maybe through the owner again but with more sensitivity.\n\nSo, while the author had a grievance, the method of handling it was likely inconsiderate and could be seen as cruel. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
