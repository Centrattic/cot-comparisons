After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic The Gathering event. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person noticed a foul odor from another player, which was noticed by others too. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was an accident. The second time, it got worse, and even the store owner refused to address it. The writer then publicly shamed the person, leading to others stepping out and the person leaving quickly. The owner and some players were upset, and one called it cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are public shaming versus protecting others from discomfort. The writer's intention was to make the person take hygiene seriously, but the method was loud and direct in front of everyone. Public shaming is generally seen as harsh, even if the issue is valid. The person might have had a valid reason (like a medical issue or personal situation) that wasn't known. The writer didn't approach the person privately first, which could have been a more respectful way to handle it. The owner's refusal to act might have been due to not wanting to embarrass the person, but the writer took matters into their own hands. \n\nPublicly calling someone out can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. Even if hygiene is important, the method used here was confrontational. The fact that others were upset and the owner was upset suggests that the approach was too harsh. A better approach might have been to speak to the person privately or find another way to address it without public shaming. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong because they chose a confrontational method that caused embarrassment, even if the problem existed.\n"
