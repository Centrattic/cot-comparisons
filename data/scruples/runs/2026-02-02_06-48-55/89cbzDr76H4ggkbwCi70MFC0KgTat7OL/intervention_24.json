After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone over bad hygiene during a Magic The Gathering event. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author noticed a foul body odor during the event, which they found offensive. They tried to ignore it initially, thinking it might be a one-time issue. The problem persisted the next week, and when they approached the store owner, he didn't help. So the author decided to publicly shame the person by announcing that they should take a shower and learn basic hygiene. The result was the person leaving, some people appreciating the action, but others, including the owner and some players, disapproving.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Public shaming is a sensitive topic. On one hand, the author was dealing with a personal discomfort (bad odor) and tried to address it. On the other hand, the method they used was public and confrontational. \n\nThe key points here are about the approach taken. Publicly calling someone out in front of a group, especially in a place where others are trying to enjoy an event, can be seen as harsh and potentially humiliating. Even if the intention was to solve a problem, the method might have been unkind or disproportionate. The author didn't approach the individual privately first, which is usually a more socially acceptable way to address such issues. \n\nThe store owner's refusal to act might have been frustrating, but the author's response escalated the situation. The fact that others found the approach cruel suggests that there's a social norm against public shaming. Even if the person's hygiene was indeed an issue, the author's loud announcement could have been damaging to the person's dignity. The person left quickly, so maybe they were aware of the problem and felt embarrassed, but the public confrontation might have been unnecessary or harsh.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were trying to protect the comfort of others and that the owner's inaction forced their hand. But from a social standpoint, the method of addressing it is questionable. There's a difference between advocating for one's own comfort and publicly humiliating someone else. The line between standing up for oneself and being considerate of others' feelings is thin here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values empathy and the method of conflict resolution. Public shaming, even for a seemingly minor issue like hygiene, is usually frowned upon because it can lead to embarrassment without giving the person a chance to improve. The author could have tried talking to the person directly or finding another way to address the issue without making it a public spectacle. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for the method they used, even if the intent was to solve a problem.\n"
