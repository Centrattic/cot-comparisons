After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone over their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author noticed a foul odor from another player, which happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, assuming it was a one-off. The second time, they went to the store owner, who told them to ignore it. Then, when the situation got worse, the author publicly called out the person in front of everyone, causing the person to leave quickly and the owner to be upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions were public shaming, which can be harsh. Even if the issue was real and annoying, the method of addressing it was confrontational and unprivate. Public shaming can be hurtful and may not be the best approach, even if the intent was to help.\n\nThe owner's reaction is also a clue. He didn't want to address it directly, perhaps to maintain a welcoming environment or avoid confrontation. The author going against the owner's wishes and taking a public approach might have overstepped. Also, the person in question left quickly, which suggests they were embarrassed or upset. The fact that others found it cruel adds another layer\u2014publicly calling someone out for their hygiene can be seen as harsh, regardless of the situation.\n\nAlternatives could have been discussed. Maybe the group could have approached the person privately, offered help or a suggestion, or the store owner could have handled it behind the scenes. Public shaming, especially in a group setting like a store event, can lead to social discomfort and may not be effective in solving the problem long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent might have been to improve the environment for everyone. But the method used was confrontational and public, which is where the issue lies. Hygiene is a sensitive topic, and addressing it in a public, shaming manner is likely to backfire, causing the person to feel attacked rather than helped.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because the approach was inappropriate. The right approach would have been a private and respectful way to address the issue, if possible.\n"
