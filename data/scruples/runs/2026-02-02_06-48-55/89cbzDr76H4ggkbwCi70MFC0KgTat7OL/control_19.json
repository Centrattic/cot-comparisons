After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was at a card shop where a regular player had a really bad odor. It happened twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. The second time, others started leaving the store in between games. The author confronted the person in front of everyone, publicly shaming them, which led to the person leaving quickly and some backlash from the owner and others.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Public shaming is generally frowned upon because it's confrontational and humiliating. The author's intention might have been to address the issue, but their method was public and loud. The owner didn't want to intervene, maybe to avoid conflict or discrimination issues. The author's friends did appreciate the action, but others, including the owner, thought it was too harsh. \n\nThe author's approach could have been more compassionate. Instead of making a public announcement, perhaps a private conversation would have been better. Also, the person's hygiene could have a valid reason (like a medical issue or limited access to showers), which the author didn't consider. Public shaming doesn't allow for that nuance and can cause emotional harm. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had a right to address a situation that was affecting their comfort and that of others. But the method used is questionable. The owner's refusal to act might have been to protect the employee or avoid legal issues, but that's speculative. \n\nSo, the author's action was inappropriate because they chose a public and shaming approach instead of a more private and empathetic solution. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
