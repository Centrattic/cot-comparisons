After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene at an MTG event. The situation is that the person had a really bad odor, which others noticed. The first time, they tried to ignore it, but the second time, the author confronted the person publicly. The owner didn't want to address it, and the author did it themselves. Now they're getting mixed reactions.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. Public shaming someone for hygiene issues... is that the best approach? Hygiene is a personal matter, and while it's a valid concern, the way they addressed it was very public and confrontational. The owner didn't want to handle it, maybe to avoid embarrassment or conflict. The author took it upon themselves, but maybe there were other ways to address it. Like, maybe approaching the person privately first? Or talking to the owner again to find a different solution. \n\nBut the user argues that the owner already said to ignore it, so maybe they felt they had no choice. However, publicly shaming someone in front of others could be seen as harsh and unkind. It's possible that the person has a valid reason for their hygiene, like financial issues, health problems, or just not having access to showers. The author made an assumption that it was the person's fault. Also, the public confrontation might have humiliated the individual, which isn't a great way to solve the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to make a point about basic hygiene and the impact on others. The situation was affecting their comfort and that of others. But maybe there's a balance between addressing the issue and respecting the person's dignity. So, while the issue is valid, the method might be what's problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the approach taken. So I think the answer is A.\n"
