After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who loudly shamed someone for poor hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person (AITA) noticed a foul body odor from a regular player at the card shop. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-time thing. But the next week, the smell was back, causing others to step out for fresh air. The owner didn't help, so the AITA publicly shamed the person, leading to the guy leaving quickly. The owner and some players were upset, and someone called it cruel.\n\nNow, the key points here are: public shaming versus addressing a genuine hygiene issue. The AITA's intention was to make the environment more comfortable for everyone, but the method was confrontational and possibly hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether this response was appropriate. On one hand, the AITA felt it was necessary to address a persistent and unpleasant situation that others were also affected by. On the other hand, publicly calling someone out in a loud and shaming way could be seen as harsh and unkind, especially in a social setting where people might be trying to enjoy their hobby.\n\nI should consider if there were other ways to handle it. The AITA tried to talk to the owner first, who didn't help. Maybe they could have approached the person privately, though they might have been worried about confrontation or if the person wouldn't take it seriously. But public shaming can lead to embarrassment and might have negative consequences for the person's self-esteem or social standing at the shop.\n\nThe owner's disapproval and others' reactions suggest that the method was not well-received. The person who called it cruel is highlighting the harshness of the approach. Even if the intention was good, the execution might have been wrong. The AITA might have overreacted, especially if the person wasn't aware of the issue. Maybe a more private, direct approach would have been better, like telling the person in question directly but respectfully, without involving everyone else.\n\nHowever, the AITA could argue that they were standing up for their comfort and that of their friends, and that the owner's refusal to address it left them with no choice. But public shaming might not be the best solution even in that case. \n\nIn conclusion, while the AITA had a valid concern, the method used was likely inconsiderate and harsh. The shame and public embarrassment caused could be seen as unnecessary, even if the intent was to improve the environment. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the approach taken was inappropriate, even if the issue itself was valid.\n"
