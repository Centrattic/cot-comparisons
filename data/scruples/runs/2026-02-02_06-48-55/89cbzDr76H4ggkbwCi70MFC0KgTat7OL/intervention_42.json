After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone for their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person noticed a foul odor from another attendee two weeks in a row. They tried to ignore it at first but eventually confronted the issue by publicly calling out the person in front of everyone, leading to the individual leaving quickly. The owner and some players were upset, and the person is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are public shaming versus addressing a hygiene issue. The author's intention was to stop the unpleasant situation for others, but the method was confrontational and public. \n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and while it's understandable that people might be uncomfortable, the approach taken here was direct and in front of a group. Public shaming can be hurtful and may not be the most effective or respectful way to handle the problem. The owner tried to ignore it, but the author took it upon themselves to address it in a way that caused the person to leave abruptly.\n\nAlternative approaches could have been more private, like approaching the individual directly with a non-confrontational message, or discussing it with the owner to find a solution without embarrassing the person. By making a loud announcement, the author likely caused emotional distress, which is why some people criticized the method as cruel.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to improve the environment for everyone. The line between standing up for oneself and being respectful to others is thin here. Public shaming often leads to negative outcomes without solving the underlying issue, especially if the person isn't aware of the problem or is dealing with personal circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the author's action was well-intentioned but poorly executed. The right approach would have been to handle it discreetly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if the issue deserved attention.\n"
