After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The author's situation is that they noticed a foul odor from another player two weeks in a row. They tried to ignore it at first, asked the owner to address it, but the owner refused. Then the author publicly called out the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving. Now, the owner and some others are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The key points here are the method the author used (public shaming) versus the problem (another person's hygiene). The author's intention was probably to address a problem that was affecting others' comfort and experience at the event. However, the method involved publicly calling someone out, which can be seen as harsh or inconsiderate.\n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and while it's understandable that a foul odor is offensive, addressing it in a public, loud manner might not be the most effective or respectful approach. The author tried to talk to the owner first, which is a good step, but when that failed, the next option was direct confrontation. However, publicly shaming someone could lead to embarrassment and might not encourage the person to improve their hygiene. Instead, it could make them defensive or upset without solving the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the situation was urgent and that others were also uncomfortable, so they took action. The owner's refusal to address it left the author with limited options. The question is about whether the method was appropriate. Public shaming is generally frowned upon because it can be hurtful and doesn't give the person a chance to respond or correct the issue privately. A more diplomatic approach, like speaking to the person directly and privately, might have been better, even though that's harder in the moment when emotions are high.\n\nAlso, considering the social dynamics of a regular event like MTG, maintaining a welcoming environment is important. Publicly calling someone out might create tension or a hostile atmosphere, which could affect the community. The owner's disapproval suggests that the method wasn't considered appropriate in that context. The person who approached the author after the event called it \"cruel,\" indicating that others might not see it as a proportionate response.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to improve the environment for everyone. The key is whether the means justified the ends. Even if the goal was to help, the method used might have been too confrontational. There's a difference between advocating for a comfortable environment and public humiliation.\n\nIn summary, while the author had a valid concern and tried to address it, the method of loud public shaming was likely inappropriate. The right approach would be to address the issue privately and respectfully, even if it's more challenging. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the method used, even if the intent was good.\n"
