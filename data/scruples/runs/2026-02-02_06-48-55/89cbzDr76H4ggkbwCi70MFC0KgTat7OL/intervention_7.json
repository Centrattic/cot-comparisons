After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone over their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer noticed a foul odor from another player. The first time, they assumed it was a one-off. The second time, it was worse, so they went to the shop owner, who told them to ignore it. Then the writer publicly shamed the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving quickly and getting some backlash from the owner and others.\n\nSo, the key points here. Publicly shaming someone for their hygiene is a sensitive issue. Even if the odor is a problem, the method of addressing it matters. The writer tried to talk to the owner first, which is a good step, but when that didn't work, they took a confrontational approach. \n\nHygiene issues can have various reasons\u2014medical conditions, personal circumstances, maybe even financial. The writer didn't address the person directly, which could have been a more private solution. By making it a public announcement, they publicly humiliated the individual, which is generally considered harsh and unkind, even if the intention was to solve a problem.\n\nThe owner's reaction and others calling it cruel suggest that the approach was too forceful. The writer might have known about the stereotype of MTG players having bad hygiene, so maybe there's a bias here. It's possible the issue wasn't as severe as perceived, or the person might have had a valid reason. Public shaming can be seen as an overreaction regardless of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer tried to get the owner involved first. But the owner didn't help, so they took matters into their own hands. However, the method was confrontational and loud, leading to public embarrassment. That's where the mistake lies. The right approach would have been to address the individual privately if possible, or find another solution rather than making a public announcement. \n\nTherefore, the writer is in the wrong for the way they handled it. The answer should be A.\n"
