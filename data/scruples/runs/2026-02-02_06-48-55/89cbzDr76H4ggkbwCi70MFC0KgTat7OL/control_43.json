After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person was at an MTG event and faced with someone's bad hygiene. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. The second time, the odor was worse, and even the store owner didn't help. The person then publicly shamed the individual, leading to the person leaving and some backlash from others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: public shaming, the owner's refusal to act, others stepping out, and the consequences. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms and appropriate conflict resolution. Public shaming can be harsh and might not be the best approach. Even if the hygiene issue was a problem, calling someone out in front of a group could be seen as harsh and potentially embarrassing. The owner didn't want to handle it, which might mean they don't want to confront customers. The author's approach might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Also, the person left quickly, so maybe they were already uncomfortable. The friends appreciated the action, but others thought it was cruel. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author tried to address a legitimate issue that was affecting their experience. They might not have known another way to handle it. However, there might have been a better approach, like privately talking to the person or involving the owner more directly.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to solve a problem, but the method was confrontational. Public shaming can lead to social discomfort and might not encourage the person to improve. The owner's reaction suggests that they wanted to avoid confrontation, so the author's action might have gone against the store's environment. \n\nIn many social situations, addressing issues directly but respectfully is preferred. The author's approach was direct but not respectful in a public setting. The fact that others found it cruel indicates that the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using public shaming instead of a more private or diplomatic approach.\n"
