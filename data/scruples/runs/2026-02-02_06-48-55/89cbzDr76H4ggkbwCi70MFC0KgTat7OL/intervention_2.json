After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer mentions that the person's body odor was so bad it was affecting others, causing people to step outside for fresh air. They tried to ignore it initially, approached the owner who didn't help, and then took direct action by publicly shaming the individual. The person left after that, but the owner and some players were upset. \n\nPublic shaming is a tricky area. On one hand, the writer was trying to address a problem that was impacting the environment and other players' experience. The hygiene issue was significant enough to disrupt the event. On the other hand, publicly calling someone out in front of others could be seen as harsh and potentially humiliating. The writer didn't address the person directly first, instead making a loud announcement that might have been embarrassing for the individual. \n\nHygiene is a personal matter, and while it's important to respect others, the approach matters. A more private approach, like confronting the individual respectfully or working with the store owner to find a solution, might have been more appropriate. The writer's method could have violated the person's dignity, which is a key aspect of social etiquette. \n\nThe owner's refusal to intervene and the subsequent backlash from some players suggest that the writer's method was not the most tactful. The fact that someone called it \"cruel\" indicates that their approach was seen as overly harsh. Even though the intention was to improve the situation, the method used might have been inappropriate. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the writer probably is in the wrong for not handling the situation more privately and respectfully. Public shaming, even with good intentions, can cause harm and might not address the root issue. The writer should have considered alternative solutions before making a public announcement.\n"
