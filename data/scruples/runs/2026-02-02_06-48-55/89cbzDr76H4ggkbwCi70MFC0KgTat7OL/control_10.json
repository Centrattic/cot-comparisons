After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for loudly shaming someone for poor hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person and their friends noticed a foul odor from another player twice. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. The second time, the smell was so bad that others were stepping outside for fresh air. The owner didn't help, so the person confronted the individual publicly, leading to the other leaving. Some people thought it was cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent, method, and consequences. The person's intention was to stop the bad smell affecting everyone. They tried to get the owner to act first, but he didn't. Then they used a public shaming approach. The question is whether this was the right way to handle it.\n\nOn one hand, the person was trying to address an issue that was affecting others' comfort and health. Hygiene is a personal responsibility, and the other person's behavior was clearly impacting others. The owner's refusal to act might have forced the person to take matters into their own hands.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly shaming someone, even in a group setting, can be hurtful and potentially humiliating. The method used was loud and direct, leading to immediate backlash from some players. The owner and others felt it was cruel, which suggests that the approach might have been too harsh. Also, the person didn't try a more private approach first, like speaking to the individual directly or suggesting a more diplomatic solution.\n\nBut, considering that the owner didn't act and the smell was affecting multiple people, the person might feel they had no choice. The alternative could be leaving the store or enduring the bad smell. However, the public confrontation might have been the wrong method. A more appropriate approach could have been discussing it privately with the person, asking the owner again to address it, or using a more respectful tone.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public shaming is generally discouraged because it can damage someone's reputation and self-esteem without addressing the root issue. Even if the person had the right intention, the method might have been inappropriate. The fact that others found it cruel supports that.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the person might be in the wrong for their approach, even if the problem was real. The right action would be to address the issue without public humiliation, perhaps through more subtle or private means.\n"
