After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone over their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. The author went to the store owner first, but the owner didn't help. Then, the author loudly called out the person in front of everyone, leading the person to leave. Others were upset, and the owner gave dirty looks.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author was wrong. Let me think about the factors here. Public shaming can be hurtful and might lead to embarrassment. Even if the hygiene issue was a problem, addressing it in a public and confrontational way could be seen as harsh. The author tried to talk to the owner first, which is a good step, but when that didn't work, maybe a more private approach would have been better. However, the author's friends and others were uncomfortable, so they felt it was necessary to act. But was there a better way? Maybe confronting the person privately instead of publicly?\n\nAlso, the story mentions that the person hadn't had the issue before, so maybe there was a valid reason. Public shaming might not be the most effective or kind way to handle it. The owner might have felt it was up to them to handle, and the author overstepped. On the other hand, the author was trying to protect the environment for everyone else. It's a tricky balance between being considerate and addressing a personal issue.\n\nI think the key here is the method used. While the intention might have been good, the approach was confrontational and public, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the issue was valid. So maybe answer A.\n"
