After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for publicly shaming someone at an MTG event due to poor hygiene. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person mentions that the smell was so bad that others were stepping outside for fresh air. They tried ignoring it first, then approached the owner, who didn't help. Then the author publicly called out the person, leading to the man leaving and some backlash.\n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and while it's valid to be concerned, the method of addressing it matters. Public shaming can be harsh and may not be the best approach. The owner's reaction and others' disapproval suggest that the public confrontation was seen as rude or inconsiderate. The person might have felt humiliated, which could affect their feelings about the community.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to address a problem that others were also bothered by. The owner's refusal to act might have left them feeling like they had to take matters into their own hands. However, there might have been more private ways to handle it, like confronting the individual directly instead of in front of everyone.\n\nSo, while the issue of hygiene is real and the situation was uncomfortable, the method used was confrontational and public. That's likely why some people thought it was cruel. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the problem existed.\n"
