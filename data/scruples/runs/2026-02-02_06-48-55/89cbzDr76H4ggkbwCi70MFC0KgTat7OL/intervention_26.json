After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for publicly shaming someone at a Magic: The Gathering event for bad hygiene. The situation is that the person smelled bad twice, and after the second time, the author confronted them in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving quickly. The owner and some others didn't like the approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author tried to talk to the owner first, who didn't help. Then the problem persisted, causing others to step outside. The author felt it was necessary to address it publicly. But was that the right approach?\n\nPublic shaming can be harsh. Even if the intent was good, doing it loudly in front of others might be considered cruel or unkind. The person might have had a legitimate reason for the odor, like a medical condition or a bad week. Publicly calling them out could be seen as humiliating. The owner's refusal to handle it doesn't give the author the right to take matters into their own hands in such a confrontational way. Maybe a more private approach, like approaching the person directly without others hearing, would have been better. Alternatively, finding another way to address it with the owner again or suggesting they leave the premises. The fact that others stepped outside suggests the situation was bad, but the method used by the author might have been too direct and public. So, the author's actions were probably inconsiderate, even if the problem was real. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
