After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone for poor hygiene during a Magic the Gathering event. \n\nFirst, the situation: there's a recurring issue with a player's bad odor. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. The second time, it's the same, and the owner won't address it. The author confronts the person publicly, leading to the guy leaving and some backlash.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether public shaming in this context is appropriate. On one hand, the author was trying to address a problem that was affecting their experience and others'. The owner didn't help, so maybe they felt it was the only option. People were stepping outside because of the smell, which is uncomfortable and possibly health-related. \n\nBut on the other hand, publicly shaming someone in front of a group could be seen as harsh and disrespectful. The person might have had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical issue or personal circumstances. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method was direct and confrontational. The owner's reaction and the feedback from another player suggest that others might not have agreed with the approach. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe approaching the person privately, using a kinder tone, or working with the shop owner to enforce some hygiene policy without shaming. But the author didn't do that; they chose a public announcement. \n\nI need to consider social norms and the balance between personal hygiene and public confrontation. Hygiene is a social expectation, but how to address it. Public shaming often leads to embarrassment and can be counterproductive. The person might have been hurt or felt targeted, even if the comment was about their odor. The author's action might have been justified in their eyes, but the method was wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that the guy left quickly after the comment might indicate that he wasn't given a chance to respond or improve. The author's words were loud and direct, which could come off as cruel, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, in summary, while the issue of poor hygiene is understandable, the way the author addressed it publicly and in a shaming manner is likely what caused the negative reactions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
