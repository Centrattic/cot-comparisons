After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author mentions that there was a recurring issue with a foul body odor at the event, which other people found unbearable. They tried to ignore it the first time but when it happened again, they went to the owner, who refused to address it. Then, the author publicly confronted the person in front of everyone, leading to the person leaving. The owner and some players were upset, with one calling it cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention to address a problem that affected others, the method they used (public shaming), and the consequences (the person left, mixed reactions). \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. In terms of ethics and social norms, public shaming is often seen as harsh and inappropriate, especially in a public setting. Even if the problem was real, the way the author addressed it might have been unkind. The person might have had a legitimate reason for the odor (e.g., medical condition, personal circumstances), and publicly humiliating them could be seen as violating their dignity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to improve the environment for everyone else. The owner didn't take action, so the author felt compelled to do something. However, there are more constructive ways to handle this, like approaching the person privately or encouraging the owner to address it without public humiliation.\n\nThe fact that the owner and some players disapproved suggests that the method was off-putting. The author might have overstepped by using such a direct and public approach, which could have caused the person to feel embarrassed and leave abruptly. \n\nSo, while the problem of poor hygiene is a valid concern, the method used by the author may be considered wrong because it involved public shaming, which is generally unkind and ineffective compared to more private or compassionate approaches. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
