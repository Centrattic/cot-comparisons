After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person was at an MTG event, and there was a guy with really bad body odor. The first time, they tried to ignore it, thinking it was a one-off. But the next week, the same guy showed up with the same smell. The owner refused to address it, so the author publicly shamed the guy in front of everyone at the store. The guy left, and some people appreciated it, but others were upset, and the owner was mad. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: the author tried to address a hygiene issue that was affecting others, but did so publicly and bluntly. The owner didn't want to intervene, maybe to avoid confrontation. The problem is that the author took matters into their own hands in a way that was publicly shaming. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, public shaming is usually not considered the best approach. It can be hurtful and embarrassing, even if the intention is to help. There might be other ways to handle it, like approaching the person privately, maybe giving a subtle hint, or involving the owner in a more diplomatic way. The author's method led to the person leaving quickly, but at the cost of public humiliation. The owner and some players disapproved, which suggests that the method was seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the person had a right to be in a comfortable environment. The smell was affecting others, so there was a valid concern. But the approach taken might not have been the most considerate. The answer probably depends on whether the ends justify the means. Even if the intention was good, the method could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they chose a public and confrontational method instead of a more private or diplomatic one. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
