After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author was in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The situation is that there was a guy with really bad body odor, and the author publicly called him out in front of everyone, leading the guy to leave quickly. The owner and some others were upset.\n\nHmm, so first, the hygiene issue is a real problem when it affects others. The guy had a foul smell that made people want to step outside. The author tried to talk to the owner first, but the owner didn't help. But then, the author chose to publicly shame the person, which is pretty harsh. \n\nPublicly calling someone out like that can be hurtful and embarrassing. Even if the issue was valid, the method might be inappropriate. The author could have handled it in a more private way, maybe approached the guy directly instead of shaming him in front of everyone. \n\nAlso, the guy might have had a legitimate reason for the odor, like a medical issue or personal circumstances he wasn't able to share. The author didn't give him a chance to explain or address it privately. Plus, the owner's reaction suggests that the method wasn't acceptable in the store's environment. \n\nSo while the problem exists, the approach taken by the author was probably too confrontational and public, which is why others found it cruel. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it.\n"
