After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story was wrong for loudly shaming someone over poor hygiene during an MTG event. I need to decide between A or B. \n\nFirst, the situation: the person did something that caused others discomfort. The author tried to address it by publicly calling out the guy's hygiene. The owner didn't want to involve, and others had mixed reactions. Some appreciated the action, others thought it was cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are about handling someone's personal hygiene issue in a public setting. The author's approach was direct and public. But is that the right way? Public shaming can be harsh and might humiliate the person, even if the issue is legitimate. The guy might have had a valid reason for the odor, like a medical condition or a bad day. The author didn't approach the person directly or privately first, which is usually a more respectful way to handle such issues. \n\nThe owner and some players criticized the approach, suggesting that it wasn't the best method. Even if the intention was good\u2014to make the environment more comfortable for everyone\u2014the method used could be seen as harsh. The person might have felt embarrassed and left the store, which could have been avoided with a more private approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had tried ignoring it first, then asked the owner, who didn't help. So their frustration is understandable. But the public confrontation escalated the situation. The right approach might have been to speak to the person directly, offer a polite suggestion, or involve the owner in a better way. Since the owner didn't act, maybe there's some blame there too, but the question is about the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's public shaming was probably inappropriate, even if the issue was valid. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
