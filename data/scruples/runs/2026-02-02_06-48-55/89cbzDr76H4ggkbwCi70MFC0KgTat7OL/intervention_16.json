After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The writer tried to handle it by talking to the owner first, but the owner refused to act. Then, when the problem persisted, they publicly shamed the person, which caused the guy to leave and some negative reactions from others.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I should consider is the method they used. Public shaming is a strong approach. Even if the issue was real and bothering others, the way they addressed it was confrontational and loud. That might be why the owner and others didn't appreciate it. The writer's friends and other players were stepping outside, which is a valid reason for the smell being a problem. But yelling it out in front of everyone could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the guy had never had this issue before. Maybe there was a medical reason or something else. The writer assumed it was a lack of hygiene, but maybe they didn't have all the facts. Publicly calling someone out without knowing the full story might not be the best approach. Even if the writer's intention was to improve the environment, the method was aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer did try to approach the owner first, which is good. The owner didn't help, so they felt pushed to take action. However, alternatives could have been considered, like talking to the person privately if they were known to the group. Since the guy didn't interact much, maybe the writer didn't know how to approach him, but making a loud announcement might have been too direct and hurtful.\n\nI think the key points here are the public confrontation and the lack of empathy. Even if the action was justified in intent, the method was inconsiderate and could be seen as cruel. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They should have handled it more discreetly, maybe by suggesting to the owner again or using a more private approach. The fact that others found it cruel supports that.\n"
