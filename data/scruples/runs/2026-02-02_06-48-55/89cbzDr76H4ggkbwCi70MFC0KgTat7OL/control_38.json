After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during a Magic: The Gathering event. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person noticed a foul odor from another participant in the MTG event. They tried to ignore it the first time, thinking it might be a one-off. But the problem persisted the next week, leading to others also being affected. The author approached the store owner, who didn't help. Eventually, the author publicly shamed the person in front of everyone, which made the situation worse and caused the person to leave quickly. The owner and some others were upset, calling the action cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's approach was public shaming, which could be harsh. The question is whether that was the wrong thing to do. \n\nPublic shaming in a social setting can be seen as aggressive and potentially hurtful. Even if the intention was to address a problem, the method might not be the best. The author had already tried to address it by talking to the owner, who didn't act. But then taking it public might have been a last resort, but it's possible that a more private approach, like directly confronting the person (if feasible), or maybe escalating through the store's management, could have been better. \n\nHowever, the person's hygiene was affecting others' comfort, and the store owner didn't help. The author might have felt that public shaming was necessary to stop the situation, but it's a judgment call. The outcome was that the person left, but others were upset with the author. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider whether the action was both necessary and proportionate. Publicly calling someone out for hygiene in front of others can be seen as harsh, even if the issue is valid. There might be a better way, like a private conversation. Since the author didn't try to approach the person directly, maybe that's where they went wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method of addressing the issue was public shaming, which is more hurtful and could have been handled more sensitively.\n"
