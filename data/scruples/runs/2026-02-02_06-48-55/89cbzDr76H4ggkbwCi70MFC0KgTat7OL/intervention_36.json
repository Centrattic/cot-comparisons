After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the wrong thing by loudly shaming someone for their bad hygiene during the MTG event. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the person was playing Magic: The Gathering at a shop with friends. They noticed a strong body odor from another player in the first week, tried to ignore it, and the second week it happened again. The owner didn't help, so the author publicly shamed the person, leading to the guy leaving and mixed reactions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the method used and the consequences. The author chose to publicly call out the person in front of everyone, which led to the guy leaving quickly. The owner and some players were upset. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to address a genuine issue that affected their comfort. Bad hygiene can be a valid concern, and it's understandable they wanted to speak up. But the approach was public shaming, which might have been harsh. Publicly humiliating someone, even if the issue is real, can be seen as cruel or inconsiderate. The guy might have had a legitimate reason, like a medical issue or personal hardship, that wasn't obvious. Also, the owner's refusal to intervene might have been a sign that the store wanted to avoid conflict, which the author didn't respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to handle it by talking to the owner first. When that didn't work, they escalated. Maybe they felt it was necessary for their own well-being and that of others. But the method of public announcement could have been more tactful. Perhaps a private approach, like confronting the person directly but respectfully, would have been better. Public shaming can lead to embarrassment and might not encourage the person to improve their hygiene; instead, it might make them defensive.\n\nThe fact that others stepped outside due to the smell shows it was affecting the environment. The author might have felt it was a last resort. However, the backlash from the owner and some players suggests that the approach wasn't well-received. The person who called it \"cruel\" indicates that the method was too harsh, even if the intent was to improve hygiene.\n\nIn terms of social norms, direct and respectful communication is usually preferred over public shaming. The author's action might have been justified in intent but flawed in execution. So, while the issue exists, the way it was handled could have been more considerate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the concern was valid.\n"
