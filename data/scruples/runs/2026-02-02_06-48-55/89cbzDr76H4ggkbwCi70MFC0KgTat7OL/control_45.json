After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So the situation is about MTG events where someone had a really bad body odor, and the author publicly shamed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in question had a foul smell that was noticed by multiple people. The first time, it was a one-off, but the second time, the smell was so bad that others were stepping outside. The author tried to talk to the owner, who didn't help, so they took matters into their own hands by making a public announcement. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Public shaming can be a sensitive issue. On one hand, the author was trying to address a problem that others were also experiencing. Maybe they felt it was necessary since the owner didn't act. On the other hand, publicly calling someone out in a loud manner could be seen as harsh and potentially humiliating, especially if the person didn't realize their smell was an issue. \n\nI should think about alternatives. Was there a more private way to handle it? Like approaching the person directly without shaming others. But the author mentioned that the owner didn't help, and the situation was affecting multiple people. Maybe the author felt there was no other option left. \n\nAlso, the owner and some players disapproved, considering it cruel. Public shaming can create a hostile environment, even if the intent was to solve a problem. The person who left might have felt humiliated, which could have a negative impact on their feelings and participation in future events. \n\nBut then again, the author was trying to protect the group's comfort. There's a balance between addressing an issue and respecting someone's dignity. The method used here was loud and public, which might be crossing a line. Maybe a better approach would be to confront the person privately, or maybe the owner should have addressed it, but since they didn't, the author felt compelled to act. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while being inconsiderate by not showering is a problem, the way the author addressed it could be seen as inconsiderate in return. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nI think the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because publicly shaming someone, even in a group setting, is a harsh response that could be avoided by more private methods. The intent might be understandable, but the method was inappropriate.\n"
