After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone shaming another person for their hygiene at a Magic The Gathering event. The user wants to know if the person who posted the story (the author) did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they and their friends noticed a foul body odor during the event. The same person had this issue in two consecutive weeks, and the owner refused to address it. The author decided to publicly shame the person by making a loud announcement about their hygiene, which led to the person leaving quickly. Some people appreciated it, but the owner and others were upset. One person called it cruel.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Public shaming is generally considered harsh and can be seen as bullying. Even if the issue is about personal hygiene, which is a personal responsibility, the method used here was public and confrontational. The owner didn't want to address it, maybe because it's a delicate situation, and the author took it upon themselves to handle it in a way that embarrassed the person in front of others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were standing up for themselves and others who were uncomfortable. The situation had gotten so bad that people were stepping outside for fresh air. Hygiene is a personal issue, and the person in question might not be aware of their smell. However, shaming them in public isn't the most effective or kind way to approach it. A more private approach, like directly talking to the person or perhaps suggesting a solution without public humiliation, might have been better.\n\nThe owner's reaction is also a point. Since the owner didn't want to intervene, the author's actions could have made things worse for the store's environment. The person who was shamed left quickly, which might have been the intended outcome, but it could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author's intent was to address a problem that others were also facing, the method used was public shaming, which is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the issue is valid, the way it was handled could have been more tactful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they chose a confrontational and public approach instead of a private and respectful one.\n"
