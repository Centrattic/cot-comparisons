After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. The writer tried to handle it by approaching the owner first, but the owner didn't take action. Then they publicly called the person out, which led to the person leaving, but the owner and some others were upset.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out if that's wrong. Well, the key points here are about addressing a problem in a respectful way. The writer says the odor was so bad that people were stepping outside for fresh air. That's a serious issue because it affects the environment for others. But instead of approaching the individual privately, they made a loud announcement. Shaming someone in public, even if the issue is real, might not be the best approach. It's possible that the person was unaware of their odor, maybe had a personal issue or couldn't shower due to circumstances. Public shaming could be hurtful and not effective.\n\nThe owner didn't act on the first complaint, so the writer took matters into their own hands. But maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the person directly, if possible, or find another way to handle it without embarrassing them. The fact that others found the approach cruel suggests that it was harsh. The writer intended to solve the problem but did so in a way that was confrontational. While the issue of poor hygiene is valid and affects the group, the method of addressing it is important. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because the public shaming was inappropriate, even if the situation was unpleasant.\n"
