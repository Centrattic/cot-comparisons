After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for shaming someone about their hygiene at a Magic: The Gathering event. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their friends noticed a strong body odor from a regular player. The first time, they assumed it was a one-off. The second time, the owner didn't help, and the author decided to publicly call out the person, leading to the person leaving. The owner and some others were upset.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments for and against.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to address a problem that was affecting their comfort. The person's hygiene was causing others to step outside, so maybe the author felt it was necessary to speak up. But doing it publicly and shaming them could be seen as harsh. Public shaming can be hurtful and might not be the best approach. The owner didn't want to handle it, but the author took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt there was no other recourse since the owner refused to act. The issue was persistent and affecting their experience. However, a private approach or suggesting the owner to talk to the person in a more discreet way might have been better. Publicly humiliating someone, even if the intention is to solve a problem, can be seen as cruel, as one of the players pointed out.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a community event, the author's actions might have created a hostile environment for the other person. It's possible that the person had a valid reason for their hygiene issues, and the public shaming could have been embarrassing and unkind.\n\nSo, balancing the need to address the issue with the method used, the author's approach was probably too direct and public. They might have been trying to help but didn't consider the social dynamics and the potential harm to the other person. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for handling the situation in a shaming manner instead of seeking a more private and compassionate solution.\n"
