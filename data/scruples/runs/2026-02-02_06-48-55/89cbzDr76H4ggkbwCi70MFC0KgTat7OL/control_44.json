After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for shaming someone at an MTG event due to poor hygiene. The situation involves two instances where the odor was a problem, and after the owner didn't act, the author publicly called out the person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was part of a regular group at the store, and the hygiene issue was a repeat. The owner refused to address it, so the author took a public approach. Publicly shaming someone can be harsh, even if the issue is valid. The key points here are the method used\u2014loudly and in front of everyone\u2014which might have been hurtful and unprofessional. \n\nHygiene is a sensitive topic because it can relate to personal issues or even medical conditions. The author assumed poor hygiene was intentional, which might not be fair. Also, confronting someone publicly without a private conversation could escalate the situation. The owner's disapproval and others' reactions suggest that the method was problematic. \n\nHowever, the author might have felt they were protecting others from discomfort, but there are more constructive ways to handle it, like speaking to the person privately first or working with the owner more effectively. The outcome was that the person left quickly, but the approach might have been too harsh. \n\nSo, considering the method and potential for harm, the answer leans towards the author being wrong. They could have handled it more tactfully, which would have been more respectful and effective.\n"
