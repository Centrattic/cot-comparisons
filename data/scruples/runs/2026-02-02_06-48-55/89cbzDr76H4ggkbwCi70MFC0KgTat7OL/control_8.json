After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was at a Magic: The Gathering event where another player had a bad body odor. They tried to ignore it the first time, but the second time, the smell was so bad that people were stepping outside. The owner didn't help, so the author publicly shamed the person in front of everyone. Now, they're being criticized for it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to address a genuine issue that affected everyone's comfort. Public events should be pleasant for all, and poor hygiene can be a problem. On the other hand, the method used was loud and public, which could be seen as shaming and disrespectful. The owner and some players disapproved, which suggests that the approach might have been too harsh.\n\nThe key points here are intent and method. Was the author's intent to help or to humiliate? They wanted to address the hygiene issue, but the public confrontation might have been unnecessary. There might have been more private ways to handle it, like talking to the person directly or involving the owner more effectively. The fact that the owner refused to act could imply that the shop isn't enforcing its policies, but that doesn't justify public shaming.\n\nAlso, the person they targeted didn't know about the issue until the shaming. That's a privacy issue. Publicly calling someone out without a private warning could be seen as cruel, as mentioned by one of the players. The author might not have considered the person's potential circumstances (like if they had a rough time, couldn't shower, etc.) that led to the odor.\n\nSo, while the problem of hygiene is valid, the method used was harsh and public. There are more considerate ways to handle such situations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of how they chose to address the issue.\n"
