After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is at fault for shaming someone about their hygiene during an MTG event. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed a foul odor from another player twice. The owner didn't help, so they publicly called out the guy, leading to the guy leaving quickly. Some people appreciated it, but others thought it was cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to address a problem that was affecting others' experience. But they did it in a public, shaming way. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nHygiene is a personal issue, and while it's valid to be concerned about health and comfort, how you address it matters. Public shaming can be hurtful and might not be the best approach. The owner didn't want to handle it, maybe because it's sensitive. The author took matters into their own hands, but maybe there were better ways, like a private conversation or involving the owner again more assertively. \n\nAlso, the person might have a valid reason for the odor that others aren't aware of. Publicly calling them out could be embarrassing and disrespectful. The fact that some people thought it was cruel suggests that the method was harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was standing up for their friends and others who were uncomfortable. It's a balance between respecting someone's dignity and addressing a real issue. Maybe the author's intention was good, but the approach was flawed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because the public shaming was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid. The right approach would have been more empathetic and private.\n"
