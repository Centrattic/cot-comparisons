I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite someone suggesting otherwise.\n\nFirst, the person made it clear it was their birthday and they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat and said it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their choice for their birthday. The person then backed out and stopped participating. \n\nThe key points here are: the author had the right to choose their own celebration, made it optional, and the other person decided not to attend. The author didn't force anyone to come. The person who left chose not to participate after being told it's the author's decision. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone hosts a birthday, they can make the choices unless others are being excluded or not given options. Here, the author did offer to see another movie on another day, but for their own birthday, they wanted this one. The others weren't forced to attend. The one person who left might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author wasn't obligated to change their plans. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made it clear it's their event and their choice. The other person's reaction is a bit harsh, but the author did nothing wrong by standing by their decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
