I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested picking a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really want to see that movie, then the person backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the movie. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated that it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They made it optional, so people could opt out. The person who suggested a different movie might have wanted a different movie, but the author had the right to choose their own preference for their birthday. The author also offered to see another movie another day, which shows they were open to compromise in the future but wanted to stick with their choice for their birthday.\n\nThe other person's reaction of not attending and stopping communication seems a bit harsh. If they really wanted to attend a different movie, maybe they should have clarified their preferences earlier or accepted that the birthday person has their own choice. The author did nothing wrong by asserting their own preference for their special day. The friends who agreed probably had no issue, and those who didn't attend were free to opt out. The author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
