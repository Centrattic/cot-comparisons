I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not being happy with that choice.\n\nFirst, the user made a post in a group chat about seeing a specific movie on their birthday, saying it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped participating. The author is now wondering if they should have compromised.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author planned the event, specified it was optional, and the friend had a different preference. The author didn't force anyone to come but wanted to see their chosen movie. The friend left because they didn't agree. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Did the author overstep by not allowing a different movie? Well, it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they celebrate. The author made it clear it's optional, so the friends weren't obligated to attend. The friend's reaction seems like they expected the author to change their preference, which might be a reasonable expectation in some social contexts, but if it's optional, maybe not. \n\nThe author's response was polite and offered an alternative for another time. The friend didn't like that and left. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their choice when they made it clear it was optional. Compromise is good, but the author isn't required to do so when it's their own event and everyone was invited on a voluntary basis. The friend might have had unrealistic expectations of the author changing plans, which could be their issue, not the author's. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They had the right to choose their movie, and the friend's choice to leave is on them, not the author. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
