I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some group members not liking it.\n\nFirst, the author invited people to a movie of their choice, making it clear it's optional. They mentioned it's their birthday and they wanted to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3.\" When someone suggested a different movie, the author stood by their choice, and then those people left the group chat.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set the event as optional, communicated their preference clearly, and the others chose not to participate. The author wasn't forcing anyone to come; they just wanted to enjoy their own birthday with the movie they wanted. The others had the choice to attend or not. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that the person who suggested changing the movie felt their preference wasn't considered. However, the author did offer that they could watch another movie on another day, showing some flexibility. The fact that the others didn't come after that suggests they weren't interested in attending the birthday movie as planned. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author wasn't coercing anyone and made it clear it's their birthday choice, then they aren't at fault. The responsibility for attending lies with the group, not the host. So the answer would probably be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
