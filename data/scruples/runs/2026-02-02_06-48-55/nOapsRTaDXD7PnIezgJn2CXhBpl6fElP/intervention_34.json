I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The question is whether the author who didn't change the movie for their birthday is at fault.\n\nSo, the situation is: The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They invited friends via group chat, said it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and the chosen movie. Then that person left the chat and didn't come.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A or B.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author made it clear it's their birthday celebration, which is a valid reason to have autonomy over the plans. They also mentioned it's optional to join, so people should know that attending is not required. The friend who wanted a different movie is disappointed, but the author had already stated their preference. The friend then decides not to attend, which is their choice. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author had the right to choose their birthday movie, especially since it's their event. They didn't force anyone to attend, and the friend left because of the movie choice, not because of some other issue. The author might have considered compromise, but since it's their birthday, it's reasonable to prioritize their own preference. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the friend felt strongly about the movie choice, but the author had already communicated their decision. The friend's reaction is a bit harsh, but the author isn't obligated to change their plans. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They made it optional, set the terms, and the friend chose to leave. The author's right to choose their celebration isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
