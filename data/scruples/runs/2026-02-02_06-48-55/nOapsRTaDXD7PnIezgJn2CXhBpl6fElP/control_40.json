I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" and invited friends, who mostly agreed. But one person suggested another movie, and when the user refused, that person backed out.\n\nFirst, the user made it clear the movie was optional. They invited others but emphasized it wasn't mandatory. So, they had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday. The friend who objected had the option to decline the invitation if they didn't want to watch that movie. The user wasn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else preferred a different movie. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. If they didn't want to see that movie, they could have politely declined to attend. The user's response was reasonable\u2014they explained it's their birthday and they wanted to see that specific movie. The friend's decision to stop talking in the group chat might indicate something else, like they felt upset or maybe they thought the user was being too rigid. But the user didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. \n\nAlso, the user offered an alternative\u2014maybe another movie on another day. That shows they were considerate. The problem here isn't with the user but perhaps with the friend's sensitivity. Birthdays are personal, and having some control over one's celebration is normal. The user isn't in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
