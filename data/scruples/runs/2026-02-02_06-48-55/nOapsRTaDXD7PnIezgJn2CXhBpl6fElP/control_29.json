I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not changing the movie for their birthday.\n\nSo the situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via group chat, saying it's optional. Most agreed, but one friend suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they really want that movie. Then the friend backed out and stopped talking. The author is now unsure if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author clearly stated it's their birthday celebration, they made it optional, and they chose the movie. The friend suggested another movie, but the author refused, which led to the friend not coming.\n\nIs the author wrong for not changing the movie? Well, it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they want to spend it. They also made it clear that participation is optional. The friend could have chosen not to come if they didn't want to see that movie. The author didn't force anyone to attend. The friend might have felt their suggestion was dismissed, but the author was within their rights to stick to their choice for their own celebration.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have been more considerate? But they did say they'd be happy to see another movie another day. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author isn't at fault here. They made it clear, optional, and it's their special day. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
