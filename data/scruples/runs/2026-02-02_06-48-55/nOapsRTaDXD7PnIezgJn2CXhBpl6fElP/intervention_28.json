I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend suggesting a different one.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person invited friends to a movie as their birthday treat, specified it's optional, and most agreed. One friend suggested changing the movie, but the author refused, and the friend then backed out. The author is now questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The main factors here are about respecting others' preferences and the context of a birthday celebration. The author made it clear it was their choice and their birthday, so they have a right to decide. The friend could have chosen not to come if they didn't want to see that movie. The author wasn't forcing anyone to attend, and since most people agreed, it seems the majority was okay with it. The friend who objected might have had a preference, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to stick with their choice. \n\nHowever, one might argue that being considerate of others' feelings is important. But the author did mention it's their birthday and that they can watch another movie another time. The friend's response of not attending and stopping the conversation seems like an overreaction. \n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong because they made their intentions clear, the event was optional, and the majority of the group was okay with it. The friend's decision to withdraw is their own choice, not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
