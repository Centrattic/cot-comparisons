I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when a friend suggested a different one. The person didn't force others to come, said it was optional, and then the friend backed out when they couldn't get their way.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author organized a movie for their birthday, invited friends, made it clear it's optional. When a friend wanted a different movie, they stood their ground, and the friend left. Now the author is questioning if they should have caved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nWell, considering that it's the author's birthday, they have the right to choose their own celebration. They did make it optional, so the friend choosing not to attend isn't the author's fault. The friend might have been expecting the author to compromise, but the author wasn't obligated to. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend felt hurt or wanted to be included in the decision more. But the author had already stated their preference and was clear it was their choice. The friend's reaction was to leave, which is their choice as well. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they followed through with their plan as stated. They didn't force anyone to come, and the friend had the option to attend or not. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
