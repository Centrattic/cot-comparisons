I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie, and when the author refused, that person backed out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the user specified it was their birthday party/gift to themselves. They had the right to choose what they wanted to do. The person who objected later probably had their own preferences, but the user made it clear it's their event. The user also offered to do another movie another day, which is a reasonable compromise. \n\nThe person who backed out might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the user wasn't wrong for sticking to their choice. The user didn't force anyone to come; they made it optional. So the responsibility is on the person who wanted to go to another movie to either accept or decline. The user's actions seem fair. \n\nI think the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong here. They had the autonomy to choose their own birthday movie, and the other person's withdrawal was their own decision. No harm done.\n"
