I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, the person decided to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat inviting friends, making it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and the chosen movie. The person who wanted a different movie then opted out and left the conversation.\n\nHmm, the key points here are that the author made it optional, communicated their choice upfront, and the other person didn't show up. The author isn't forcing anyone to come. They even offered to see another movie another day. The other person might have felt disrespected, but the author had the right to choose their own celebration. \n\nI think it's important to note that the author didn't pressure anyone. Since it was optional, those who wanted to come did, and the one who didn't could leave. The author isn't at fault here. The person who left might have had their own reasons unrelated to the movie choice, but the author isn't wrong for sticking to their plan. So the answer should be B.\n"
