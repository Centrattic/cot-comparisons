I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie and invited friends. When one friend suggested a different movie, the user refused, explaining it was their choice for their birthday. The friend then backed out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's actions. They clearly stated their preference and made it optional for others to join. They even offered to see another movie another day. The friend's reaction seems a bit abrupt. The user isn't being unreasonable here; it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose their celebration. The friend's decision to not attend might stem from not being okay with the choice, but that's their own responsibility. The user isn't obligated to change their plans if they've communicated it's optional. So, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
