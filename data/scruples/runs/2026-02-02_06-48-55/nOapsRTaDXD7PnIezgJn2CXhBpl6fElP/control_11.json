I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole in this situation. So the scenario is they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday, posted in a group chat, said it's optional, most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie, the user said it's their choice, and that person backed out and stopped talking.\n\nHmm. The user is wondering if they should have changed the movie. The key points here: They were hosting their own birthday, asked friends to join, made it clear it's optional. They had the right to choose the movie as their own gift. The friend who objected then didn't come and stopped participating. \n\nSo, if you're the one celebrating your birthday, it's your event. You get to decide the activities. The friends who agreed were being considerate. The one who wanted a different movie could have said, \"I prefer another one, but maybe next time. Happy birthday!\" Instead, they just left. That's probably their issue. The user didn't have to change the movie, especially since they made it optional. The friend chose not to attend, but that's their choice. The user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
