I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday.\n\nSo the situation: The author wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via a group chat. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused because it was their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The person who suggested the change ended up not coming and stopped participating in the chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. It's the author's birthday, so they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. They made it clear the movie was optional, so attending wasn't required. The friend had the choice to come or not. The author didn't force anyone to attend, just extended an invitation. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems a bit harsh. If they didn't want to see that movie, they could have politely declined the invitation without making the author feel guilty. The author was firm but respectful in their response, explaining that it's their birthday and the movie is what they wanted. Offering to see another movie another day shows consideration for others' preferences in the future.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made their choice clear, kept it optional, and stood by their decision. The friend's decision to not come isn't the author's fault. The author isn't obligated to change their plans based on someone else's preference if it's their own celebration. So the answer should be B.\n"
