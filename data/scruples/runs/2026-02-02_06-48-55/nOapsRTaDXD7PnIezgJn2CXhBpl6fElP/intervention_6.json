I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday was in the wrong when they refused to change the movie despite a group member's request.\n\nFirst, the author organized their own birthday celebration and chose the movie. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. When the author stood by their choice, that person left the chat.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms, when you host your own event, you have the right to make the decisions. The author didn't force others to come; they just invited people who could choose to attend. The other person's objection wasn't a strong reason\u2014they just wanted a different movie. The author's response was polite and reasonable, suggesting another time for an alternative movie. The person who left chose to not attend, which they were entitled to do. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were clear about the plans, and the others had the choice to participate. The person who left took issue with the movie choice, but that's a personal preference, not a valid reason to call the author an asshole. The key points are the author's autonomy in their own celebration and the optional nature of the invite. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
