I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. They mentioned it was their birthday and the movie was their choice. Then one friend suggested a different movie, and when they refused, the friend didn't show up.\n\nHmm. Well, it's their birthday, so they had the right to choose what they wanted. They also said it was optional for others to come. The friend didn't like the movie choice and chose not to attend. The person is wondering if they were wrong for not changing the movie.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the author isn't in the wrong. They made it clear it was their birthday, and the movie was their choice. They also said others didn't have to join. The friend who left the group chat seems to have taken it as a rejection, but the author didn't force anyone to come. People have different preferences, and if someone prefers a different movie, they can choose not to attend. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else doesn't like the choice. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
