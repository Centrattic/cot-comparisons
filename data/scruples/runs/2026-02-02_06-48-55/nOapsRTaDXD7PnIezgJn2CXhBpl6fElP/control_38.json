I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. Here's the situation: They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted the time and asked if others wanted to join, said it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, and offered to watch another time. Then that person backed out and stopped chatting.\n\nSo, the key points here. The user chose a movie for their own birthday, made it clear it's optional. Others joined, but one person disagreed. The user didn't budge, and the person left. Now they're wondering if they should have compromised.\n\nFirst, birthdays are personal. The user is celebrating their own special day, so having some control over the plans is reasonable. They asked others to join but emphasized it's optional. The fact that most agreed supports that their choice was acceptable to the majority. \n\nThe one person who wanted a different movie could have declined if they weren't happy with the choice. The user offered an alternative, which is good. The person's reaction seems a bit strong. If it's a one-time event and the user is firm in their choice, it's their right to do so. \n\nHowever, maybe the person felt respected or included if their suggestion wasn't considered. But the user didn't force them to come, and it was their birthday. The responsibility here might be on the person who left, as they could have either accepted the choice or chosen not to attend. \n\nThe user's actions don't seem wrong. They communicated clearly, were flexible in the future, and it was their own celebration. The person who backed out might be overreacting or not respecting the user's autonomy. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
