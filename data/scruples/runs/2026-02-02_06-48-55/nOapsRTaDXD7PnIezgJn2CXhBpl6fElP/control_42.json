I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else not coming because they wanted a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person planned their birthday movie as a gift to themselves. They posted in a group chat and said it's optional. Most people agreed to join. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped talking. \n\nSo, the key points here: the author made it clear it's optional and their choice. They didn't force anyone to come. The other person had a different preference but the author wasn't obligated to change it. The person who left chose not to attend because their preference wasn't met. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made their intentions clear and it was optional. The other person's reaction seems like they weren't comfortable with the choice and decided to not attend. The author isn't at fault here because they didn't coerce anyone, and it's their birthday. They had the right to choose what they wanted for their celebration. The person who left is the one who didn't follow through, not the author. So the answer is B.\n"
