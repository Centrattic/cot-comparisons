I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via a group chat. They said it's optional if others want to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, adding that they could do another movie another day. Then the person who suggested the change decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are autonomy and social dynamics. The author made a personal choice for their birthday movie, which is their right. They also made it clear it's optional for others to join. The friend who wanted a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but the author had already stated it's their choice. However, maybe the friend felt slighted because the author didn't accommodate their preference, leading them to leave the group chat. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't force anyone to come. They said it's optional. So if someone doesn't like the chosen movie, they can just not come. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their choice for their own birthday. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top\u2014opting out of the event and stopping communication in the group chat could be seen as their own issue. The author didn't do anything to prevent others from attending; they were free to stay or go. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more accommodating by suggesting a compromise, but the author already offered an alternative (another day for a different movie). So the author isn't being unreasonable. The friend's response is the problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing their preferred movie for their birthday. The friend's choice to not attend is their own decision, and the author shouldn't be held responsible for that. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
