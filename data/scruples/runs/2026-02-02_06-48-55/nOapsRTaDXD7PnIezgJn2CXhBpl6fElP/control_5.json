I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via group chat, saying it's optional. Some agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and their choice, and the person who suggested it then backed out and stopped talking.\n\nFirst, the user made it clear that attending was optional. They didn't pressure anyone. The friend suggested a different movie, but the user had already made their choice. The user's response was polite, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The friend then decided not to come, which is their right. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Probably not. They were upfront about the plan being optional. They didn't force anyone to come. The friend had a different preference and chose not to attend, which is a common occurrence. The user isn't obligated to change their own plans for someone else's preference unless they agreed to compromise beforehand. The user's choice was respected by those who attended, and the one who left is within their right to do so. \n\nSo the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
