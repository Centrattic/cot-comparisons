I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it even when a friend suggested another option.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person planned their birthday movie as How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, making it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The person stood by their choice, and the friend then decided not to come and stopped talking. Now the person is wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not changing the movie was wrong. Let's consider the context. The birthday is their own celebration, so they have the right to choose how they want to spend it. They did communicate that it was optional, so friends were aware. The friend who suggested another movie might have had a preference, but the person was clear that it was their choice for the birthday. The friend didn't have to attend if they didn't agree, but maybe the abrupt withdrawal and silence was the issue here.\n\nThe person did offer an alternative: maybe another movie on another day. That shows they were open to other times but wanted this specific movie for their birthday. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh if they just stopped talking because the movie wasn't changed. The person didn't force anyone to come; they were just making a choice for their own celebration.\n\nPossible angles: Was the person inconsiderate by not compromising? But it's their birthday, so they have the right to prioritize their preference. The friend might have felt disrespected, but the person explained that it's their day. However, if the friend had a strong reason (like not liking the movie or conflicting with their schedule), maybe there's more to it. But the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone hosts an event (even for themselves), others are expected to respect the host's choices, especially when it's optional. The friend had a choice not to attend but the way they left might be the problem. The person in the story didn't do anything to exclude others; they were inclusive and optional.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made their choice clear, kept it optional, and offered alternatives. The friend's response was their own choice, but the author isn't at fault for not changing the movie. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
