I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation where they didn't change the movie choice for their birthday. The scenario is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie, and when the author didn't agree, that person backed out.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear it was their birthday and they chose the movie, with others agreeing. The key points here are autonomy and communication. The author set the terms: it's their choice, and others could opt in or out. The dissenting person might have been disappointed, but the author isn't obligated to change their preference just because someone else prefers a different movie. The author was respectful in their response, suggesting another time for a different movie. The other person's reaction of walking away is their own choice. \n\nPossible angles to consider: was the author considerate? Yes, by making it optional. Did they overrule someone's preference? Maybe, but it was their birthday, so they have the right to choose. The person who left might be oversensitive or had a different expectation. The author isn't in the wrong because they communicated clearly and others were aware it was optional. So the answer should be B.\n"
