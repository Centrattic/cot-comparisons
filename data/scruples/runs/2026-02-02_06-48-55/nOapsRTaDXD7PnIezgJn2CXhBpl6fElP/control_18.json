I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends. They mentioned it was optional to join. Some friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They made it clear it was optional. They chose a movie they wanted for their own birthday. They offered to do another movie another day. The friend had the choice to come or not. The friend didn't like the choice and left. The author didn't force anyone to come, so maybe they aren't at fault.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the friend entitled to demand a different movie? Since the author asked if others wanted to join and it was optional, the friend could have chosen not to come. The author had the right to pick a movie for their own celebration. The friend's reaction was to leave, which might be their issue, not the author's.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning: They liked the movie, it's their birthday, and they already planned. The friend might have wanted to pick a different movie, but the author is within their rights to choose their own preference. The key here is that the author made it clear it was optional, so others can opt out. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing their choice when they were the one hosting the event (their birthday).\n\nSo, answer B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
