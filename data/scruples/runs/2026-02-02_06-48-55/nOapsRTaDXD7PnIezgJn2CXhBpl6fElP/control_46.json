I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their 20th birthday movie choice.\n\nSo, the user wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday. They posted in a group chat with the time and asked if others wanted to join, making it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground because it's their birthday and they like the movie. The person who suggested a different movie then backed out and stopped participating. The author is now wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the author made it clear it's optional, they chose the movie for their own birthday, and when someone suggested a different movie, they refused. The other person then didn't come. The question is whether the author was wrong to not change the movie.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main factors are intent and fairness. The author's intent was to have their birthday movie, which they had the right to do. They made it optional, so others weren't obligated to come. The one person's suggestion to change the movie might have been a respectful attempt to include others, but the author has the right to prioritize their own preferences on their birthday. The fact that most others agreed supports that the author's choice was acceptable. The person who left might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author didn't force anyone to come. Since the author was clear it's optional and it's their birthday, they're not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
