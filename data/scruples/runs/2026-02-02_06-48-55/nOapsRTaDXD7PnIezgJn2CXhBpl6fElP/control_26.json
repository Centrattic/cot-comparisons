I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So the situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The user stood their ground, and that person left, not attending.\n\nFirst, the user made it clear the movie was optional and they were inviting others to join. They even offered to watch another movie another time if the others wanted. But the one person who suggested a different movie then decided not to come. The user is now questioning if they should have changed the movie instead of sticking with their choice.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the user had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday. They didn't force anyone to come, just invited them. The person who objected had the option to not attend if they didn't like the choice. The user didn't act out of line by not changing the movie, especially since they had already committed to it. The other person's reaction of walking out might be more about their own preferences or expectations, not the user's fault. So the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
