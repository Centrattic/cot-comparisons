I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they are the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The user refused, and that person stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the user organized the event, made it clear the movie is optional, and the person in question didn't have to come if they didn't want to. The user's response was polite, offering to go to another movie another day. The friend might have felt excluded or that their preference wasn't considered, but the user was within their right to choose their own birthday movie. Friends can be free to attend or not, especially if it's their own choice. The user wasn't forcing anyone to come, so they might not be in the wrong. But maybe the friend felt hurt, and the user could have been more considerate. However, the friend also had the option to accept or decline. So probably, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
