I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after one friend suggested changing it.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, making it optional for friends to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested picking a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the friend then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider the key points. The author clearly stated it was their birthday and that they chose the movie, emphasizing it was optional. The friend who objected might not have liked the movie choice or maybe wanted a different movie. However, the author didn't force anyone to come\u2014they made it optional. The friend had the choice to not attend if the movie didn't appeal to them. \n\nBut maybe the friend felt slighted because the author didn't consider their preference. However, since it's the author's birthday, they have the right to choose their celebration. The friend's reaction of not showing up and leaving the group chat might be overreacting. The author isn't obligated to change the movie just because one person didn't like it, especially when others were okay with it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend felt excluded or that their opinion wasn't respected. But the author did offer to watch another movie another day. So, the author was compromising in a way. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author was inconsiderate. Since they made it clear it was optional and their choice, they aren't in the wrong. The friend's reaction seems too harsh. So the answer is B.\n"
