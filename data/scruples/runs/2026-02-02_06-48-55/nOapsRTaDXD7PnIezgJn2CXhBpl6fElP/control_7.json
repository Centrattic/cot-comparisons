I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their 20th birthday and not changing it despite a friend's request.\n\nSo, the person organized a movie night for their birthday, picked \"How to Train Your Dragon 3,\" and invited friends through a group chat. They mentioned it's optional. Most agreed, but one friend suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are about respecting the birthday person's choice versus the friend's preference. The author had the right to choose their own celebration, especially since they invited others and made it optional. The friend had the option to attend or not. The author didn't force anyone to come. The friend might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author isn't obligated to change their own plans. The response from the friend seems like they took it personally, maybe expecting the movie to be changed, but since it was optional, the author isn't at fault. So the answer should be B.\n"
