I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're an asshole for not changing the movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie, and when the author refused, that person backed out.\n\nFirst, the author did ask if others wanted to join and made it clear it was optional. The person who suggested a different movie might have expected the author to change their choice, but the author had already decided. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just shared their plan. The other person chose to leave the group chat, which is their right. The author isn't in the wrong because they were clear about their preference and didn't pressure others. The person who left might have felt their opinion wasn't respected, but the author had every right to choose their own movie for their birthday. So the answer should be B.\n"
