I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching How to Train Your Dragon 3. They invited friends via group chat, mentioned it's optional, and most agreed. Then one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really want to see that movie. The person who suggested changing the movie then backed out and stopped communicating.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The author's perspective: it's their birthday, they chose the movie, and they made it clear it's optional. They offered to do another movie another day. The other person didn't like that and left. The author is questioning if they should have given in.\n\nFrom the other person's side, maybe they wanted a different movie and felt their preference wasn't considered. But the author is the one whose birthday it is, so they have the right to choose. The key points here are the author's right to their own celebration and the option others have to opt out. Since the author made it clear it's optional, those who don't want to go can leave, but the author isn't wrong for sticking to their choice. The other person's reaction seems over the top. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
