I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So the situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, they announced it in a group chat, said it's optional, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie, and when the author refused, that person bailed and stopped talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is celebrating their birthday, which is a personal event. They had the right to choose how they want to celebrate. They made it clear the movie was optional, so people could opt out. The majority agreed, so it's not like they forced others. The one person who objected decided not to come after the choice wasn't changed. \n\nThe key points here: The author didn't force anyone to come. They were invited, but it was optional. The person who left was unhappy with the movie choice, but the author had the right to pick their own movie for their birthday. The person could have chosen not to attend, which they did. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, maybe not. They were clear about their choice, and it was their birthday. The other person might have expected a different movie, but since it was optional, they could have attended anyway or just left without making a scene. The author isn't wrong for sticking to their preference. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural aspect. In some cultures, group decisions are more important, but the user did make it clear it was optional. The person might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author's choice for their own event is valid. \n\nSo the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to choose, others were free to opt out. The person who left is the one who might be at fault for not respecting the author's choice and making a big deal about it.\n"
