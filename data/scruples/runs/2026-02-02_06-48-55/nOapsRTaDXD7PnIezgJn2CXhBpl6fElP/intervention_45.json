I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else not joining after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person organized the movie as their birthday event. They asked if others wanted to come, making it optional. When someone suggested a different movie, the author stood by their choice. The other person then decided not to attend and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal choices. The author had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday celebration. They clearly stated it was optional, so others weren't obligated to attend. The person who suggested a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author wasn't required to change their plans. \n\nHowever, maybe the other person felt excluded or that their opinion was ignored. But the author wasn't forcing anyone to attend. The responsibility is on both sides: the author had the right to choose, and the other person had the choice to either accept the plan or not attend. It's possible the other person overreacted. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made it clear it was optional and explained their choice. They didn't have to accommodate someone else's movie preference for their own event. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
