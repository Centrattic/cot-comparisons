I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday, inviting friends, and then one friend suggesting a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the friend didn't come, leading to the author's uncertainty.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it's their birthday and mentioned the movie choice, making it optional. They invited people to join but kept the choice of movie. When a friend suggested changing it, the author politely declined, explaining it's their birthday choice. The friend then backed out. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they made it clear it's their choice and it's optional. The friend had the option to come or not. The author didn't force anyone to attend. The friend's decision to not come because they didn't get their movie choice might be about personal preference. The author isn't obligated to change their plans for someone else's preference, especially when they set the terms upfront. \n\nPossible angles: Some might think the author should be more accommodating, but the friend didn't commit until the last minute. The author had the right to make it their own celebration. Also, the friend could have chosen to attend anyway or suggested another movie earlier. The author isn't in the wrong here because they made it optional and clear it's their choice. The friend's reaction seems extreme, so the answer is B.\n"
