I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing the movie for their birthday.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional to join, and most people agreed. But one person suggested a different movie. The author refused because it was their choice for their birthday, and the person who suggested it then didn't come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Well, the author did mention it was their birthday and that they chose the movie. They also said it's optional, so people could opt out. The other person didn't like the choice and decided not to attend. \n\nIs the author wrong for not changing the movie? Well, it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. The friend had the choice to come or not. Maybe the author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. But maybe they should have been more considerate or discussed it earlier. The person who left could have just not come without making a scene. \n\nI think the key points are: the author made it clear it's optional, the friend had a choice. The author isn't wrong for not changing the movie because it's their own celebration. The friend might have felt disappointed, but that's their reaction. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
