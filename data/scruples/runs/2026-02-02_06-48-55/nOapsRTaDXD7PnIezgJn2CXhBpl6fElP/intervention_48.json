I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday party and not changing it despite a friend's request.\n\nFirst, the person planned their own birthday movie outing and invited friends. They clearly stated it was optional for others to join. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it was their birthday and they wanted to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3.\" The friend then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, considering the options. The key points here are about autonomy and social expectations. The author had the right to choose their own celebration since it's their birthday. They made it clear participation was optional. The friend's request to change the movie is a preference, but the author isn't obligated to comply because it's their personal event. The friend chose not to attend, which is their right as well. The author didn't force anyone to come or make them feel bad for declining. \n\nHowever, could there be a social norm expectation to compromise? In some cases, friends might expect flexibility, but it's not a given. Since the author made it optional and the friend didn't attend, the author isn't wrong for not changing the plan. The friend's reaction might be more about personal disappointment than the author's fault. The author isn't in the wrong because they respected others' choice to opt out and maintained their own wishes for their birthday.\n"
