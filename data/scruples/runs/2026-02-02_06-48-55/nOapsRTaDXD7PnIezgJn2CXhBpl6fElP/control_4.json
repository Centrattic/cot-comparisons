I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they wanted for their birthday. They invited friends to a movie, specified it was optional, and when one person suggested changing it, they declined and the person left. \n\nFirst, the user made it clear it was optional for others to join. So, friends weren't obligated to come. The one person who wanted a different movie might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but the user was celebrating their own birthday. It's common for the person hosting or organizing to choose the activity, especially if they're paying or making the effort.\n\nThe user was firm but polite, offering an alternative time for another movie. The friend's reaction of not coming and leaving the group chat seems a bit harsh, but maybe they were disappointed. However, the user isn't wrong for sticking to their choice, especially since they made it optional. The friend had the choice to attend or not. \n\nNo one is entirely in the right or wrong here, but the user isn't the asshole. They communicated clearly and stood by their decision, which is reasonable for their own celebration.\n"
