I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it even when someone objected.\n\nFirst, the person made it clear that the movie choice was optional. They asked if others wanted to join and emphasized it's their birthday. When one person suggested a different movie, the author stood their ground, explaining it's their choice and offered to watch another movie another time. The objector then decided not to come and stopped participating in the chat.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author set the terms, others were invited voluntarily, and the objection came after the initial invitation. The person who objected had the choice to not come. The author's response was respectful, acknowledging the suggestion but firm about their choice. The fact that the objector left the group chat might indicate they were unhappy, but the author didn't force anyone to attend. The movie choice is also a personal preference, and the author's 20th birthday is a significant event where they might want to choose their own celebration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they were clear about it being their event and their choice. The person who objected could have chosen not to attend without making a scene. So the answer should be B.\n"
