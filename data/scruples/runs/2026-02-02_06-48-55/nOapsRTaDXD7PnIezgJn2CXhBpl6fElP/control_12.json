I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about them not changing the movie they chose for their birthday party when someone suggested a different one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The poster stood by their choice, and that person left the group chat and stopped talking.\n\nSo the question is, is the poster in the wrong? The user is asking for a judgment here. Let me think about social norms. When it's someone's birthday, they usually get to choose the plans for their own celebration, especially since they mentioned it's optional. The person who didn't like the movie choice had the option to not join but instead confronted the poster, leading to tension.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the issue is about respecting others' preferences. The person who wanted a different movie might feel their preference wasn't considered. But since the original poster explicitly stated it's their choice for their birthday, that person could have opted out instead of pushing for a change. \n\nI think the main point is that the birthday person has the right to choose their own celebration, especially when others agreed. The person who objected could have just not attended instead of causing a conflict. So the poster isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
