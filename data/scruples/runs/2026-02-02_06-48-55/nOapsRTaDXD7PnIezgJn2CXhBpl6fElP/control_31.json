I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't change the movie for their birthday is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat about the date and time, saying it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person who suggested another movie then backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. The author clearly stated it's their birthday celebration and that the movie choice was optional for others. They even offered to do another movie another time. The other person's reaction was to not attend, which they had the right to do. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was unreasonable. Since it's their birthday, they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. The group was invited, but participation was optional. The author didn't force others to watch the movie, so they aren't wrong for making a personal choice. The other person's disappointment led them to not attend, but that's their own decision. \n\nAlso, the author didn't ignore the suggestion; they acknowledged it and stood by their choice. There's no indication of bad intent. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
