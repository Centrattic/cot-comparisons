I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not being happy about it.\n\nFirst, they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat about the movie, time, and asked if anyone wanted to join. They made it clear it was optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author said it was their birthday and they wanted to see that movie, offered to do another one another day. Then the person who suggested the other movie didn't come and stopped talking in the group. Now the author is unsure if they should have changed the movie.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. \n\nWhen it comes to birthdays, it's common for the person having the birthday to choose what they want. The author made it clear it was optional, so those who wanted to come could. They also offered to do another movie another time. The friend who suggested changing the movie didn't have to come, but instead of dropping out, they tried to change the decision. The author stood their ground, which is reasonable since it's their birthday. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend felt ignored or not heard. But the author was firm in their choice. The friend's reaction might have been overreacting. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing the movie since they were clear it was their choice and optional for others to attend. They didn't force anyone to come. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). They had the right to choose their movie for their birthday, and others could decline if they didn't like the choice. The friend's decision to stop talking might be their own issue, but the author isn't responsible for that. The main point is that the author wasn't wrong in not changing the movie. They followed through with their plan after others agreed initially. The friend's suggestion was a last-minute change, and the author was consistent in their decision.\n"
