I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they wanted to see on their birthday. They chose How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted it in a group chat, said it's optional to join. Most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that person left the group chat.\n\nHmm. The key points here: It's the author's birthday, they specifically mentioned it's their choice, and others were invited but it was optional. The person who wanted a different movie had the option not to come. The author didn't force anyone to come; they just wanted to see the movie they wanted. The other person might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author had the right to choose their own celebration. \n\nWait, but maybe the issue is that someone else wanted to see a different movie and left because their preference wasn't met. But the author didn't say they had to come. If it was optional, maybe the other person just wasn't interested in that movie and decided not to attend. The author isn't wrong for choosing their own movie. People can have different preferences. Unless the group had a prior agreement that they'd all pick movies together, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo in this case, the author is within their rights to choose their own movie for their birthday. The other person can choose not to attend if they don't want to see that movie. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
