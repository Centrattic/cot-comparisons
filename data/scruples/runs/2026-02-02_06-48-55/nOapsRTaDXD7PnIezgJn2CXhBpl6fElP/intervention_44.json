I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday movie choice.\n\nSo the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They mentioned it was optional. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that friend pulled out and stopped talking in the group. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong to not change the movie.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author set up the event, made it optional, and was clear about their preference. The friend wanted a different movie but then decided not to attend. The author's reasoning is that it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose the movie. The friend might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author made it clear it's their choice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they invited people and made it optional. If someone doesn't want to attend because of the movie choice, that's their choice. The author isn't obligated to change plans based on one person's suggestion, especially when it's their birthday. The friend might be overreacting by not attending, but the author isn't the asshole here. They communicated clearly and the friend chose to leave. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
