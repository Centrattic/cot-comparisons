      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking for advice on whether they were an asshole (AITA) for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The scenario is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via a group chat, making it clear it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested picking a different movie. The author then said it's their birthday, they wanted that movie, and offered to watch another on another day. The person who suggested the change then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat. Now the author is wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author made it clear the movie was optional. They chose a movie they liked for their birthday. When someone suggested changing it, the author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend didn't like that and left. \n\nSo, the main question is: was the author in the wrong for not changing the movie? \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's their birthday, and they made the plans with the understanding that others could opt out. They were respectful and even offered an alternative. The friend's reaction seems extreme. On the other hand, maybe the friend expected more flexibility or felt their preference wasn't considered. \n\nBut the author didn't force anyone to come. They invited people but made it optional. The friend had the choice to attend or not. The author's response was reasonable\u2014stating their preference and being clear it's their special day. It's common for people to choose activities they like for their birthdays, especially if they've invited others but made it optional. \n\nThe friend might have felt that the movie wasn't to their taste, but that's their own preference. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else doesn't like the choice. Unless there was some prior agreement about involving everyone in the movie choice, which there doesn't seem to be, the author is within their rights to pick the movie for their own birthday. \n\nIn some cases, being considerate of others' preferences is important, but the author already offered a compromise (watching another movie another day). The friend's decision to back out after that seems their own choice, not the author's fault. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They communicated their preference clearly, respected others' choice to opt out, and stood by their decision for their special day. The friend's reaction, while disappointing, doesn't make the author the asshole.\n"
