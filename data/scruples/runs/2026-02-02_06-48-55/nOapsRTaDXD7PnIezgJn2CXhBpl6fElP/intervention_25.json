I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite someone else's request.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author explained it was their choice for their birthday and that others could watch another movie on another day. The person then decided not to come and stopped talking in the group. Now the author is questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the key points: The author made the movie choice clear before asking if others wanted to join. They specified it was optional. When someone wanted to change it, the author stood by their choice, which is their right since it was their birthday. The other person chose not to attend after that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they organized the event around their own birthday, which is a personal celebration. They should have the autonomy to choose the activity. The friend could have accepted or declined without trying to change the plan. The author didn't force others; they just wanted to see the movie they wanted. The friend's reaction of not attending and stopping communication seems extreme. The author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their decision when it was their time to celebrate. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
