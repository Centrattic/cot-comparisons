I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else objecting and then not showing up.\n\nFirst, the person planned their own birthday movie night, chose a movie they wanted to see. They made it clear it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person who suggested a different movie backed out and stopped participating.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author set the terms, it was optional, and they made their preference known. The other person had the choice to join or not. The author didn't force anyone to come. The person who didn't come might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author wasn't obligated to change their plans since it was their own event.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They had the right to choose their own birthday activity. The other person could have chosen another movie day or just not attended. The author's actions were reasonable given the context. So the answer should be B.\n"
