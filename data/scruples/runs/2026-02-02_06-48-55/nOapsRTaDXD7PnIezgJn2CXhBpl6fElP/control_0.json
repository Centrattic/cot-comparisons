I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, the user planned their birthday movie night and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional, and most agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie, and the user stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nHmm, so the user is wondering if they were wrong for not changing the movie. Let me think about the key points here. The user made it clear the movie was their choice and that attending was optional. They even offered to watch another movie another time. The friend who wanted a different movie could have chosen not to come, but instead of just not attending, they pushed to change the movie and then left when they couldn't. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, they were celebrating their own birthday and had the right to choose the movie. They didn't force anyone to come. The friend had the option to attend alone or not come at all. The user didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their choice. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top. Maybe they were expecting the user to compromise, but since the user had already made it clear it was their choice, the friend's response was unnecessary. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the user isn't in the wrong). They had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday and made it optional. The friend's reaction was their own issue.\n"
