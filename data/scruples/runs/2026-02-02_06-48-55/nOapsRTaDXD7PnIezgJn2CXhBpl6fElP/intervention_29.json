I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that friend backed out. Now the author is questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. When hosting or organizing an event, especially when it's your own event like a birthday, you have the right to make choices. The author was clear it was optional, so those who agreed were on board. The friend who didn't like the movie choice had the option to not attend, which they did. The author didn't force anyone to come or to pick a specific movie. They even offered to watch another movie another day, which shows they were open to other plans, just not for this occasion.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the friend felt left out or that their preference was dismissed. But the author was clear it was their birthday, and the choice was theirs. The friend's reaction might be more about their own preferences and not being able to handle disagreement. The author wasn't inconsiderate; they were firm but polite. Since the attendance was optional, the author isn't at fault here. The friend chose not to participate, which is their right.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They made their intentions clear, respected others' choice to participate or not, and stood by their own choice for their special day.\n"
