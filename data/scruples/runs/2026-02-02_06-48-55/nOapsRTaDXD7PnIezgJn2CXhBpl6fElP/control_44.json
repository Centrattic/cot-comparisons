I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie for their birthday. They wanted to see HTTYD3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional, most people agreed. One person suggested a different movie, the author refused, and that person left and stopped talking in the group.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They emphasized it's optional, so people should come if they want. The person who suggested a different movie was probably expecting the author to change it, but the author stood their ground. The key points are: the author's choice for their own birthday, optional participation, and the other person's reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's their birthday; they should have the right to choose. The other person didn't have to come if they didn't like the movie. The author was respectful by saying others could see another movie on another day. The person who left might be overreacting. So the answer is probably B. They're not in the wrong.\n"
