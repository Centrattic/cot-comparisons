I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Some friends agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted that movie. The person who suggested changing the movie then backed out and stopped talking.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about choice and boundaries. The author clearly stated it was optional, so people could opt out. The person who wanted a different movie could have chosen not to come instead of trying to change the plans. The author had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday. The other person's reaction seems a bit harsh. They didn't have to attend, but they tried to influence the choice and then left when they couldn't. That seems like their issue, not the author's. The author didn't pressure anyone; they just made their choice. So probably, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
