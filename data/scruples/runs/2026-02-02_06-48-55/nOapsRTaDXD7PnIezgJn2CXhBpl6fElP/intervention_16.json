I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after one friend suggested changing the movie.\n\nFirst, the person set up a movie night for their birthday, picking How to Train Your Dragon 3. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then that friend backed out.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it was wrong for the author to stick with their chosen movie despite the suggestion. I need to consider the context. The author was clear it was optional, and they invited others, not forced them. The friend who objected didn't show up anyway. The author's birthday is their time, so they have the right to choose the celebration's details. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a social expectation to consider others' preferences, especially if they're close friends. But since the author emphasized it was optional, the responsibility isn't on them to accommodate everyone. The friend who left might be overreacting, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had the right to choose for their own birthday, and the friend chose not to attend. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
