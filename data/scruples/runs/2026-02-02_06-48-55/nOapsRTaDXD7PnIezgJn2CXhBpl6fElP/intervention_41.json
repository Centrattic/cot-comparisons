I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that the person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday, posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author said it's their birthday and they chose the movie, offered to see another one on another day, but the person then said they wouldn't come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is celebrating their birthday. They chose a movie they wanted to see, which is a personal choice. They made it clear it's optional for others to join. That's important because they didn't force anyone to come. The person who suggested a different movie might have had their own preferences or wanted to pick a different movie for the group. However, the author is the one hosting the event, their birthday, so they have the right to choose the movie. \n\nWhen the person couldn't agree and decided not to come, maybe they were being a bit sensitive or wanted the group to compromise. But the author was clear it's their choice. The fact that after the author refused to change the movie, the person left the group chat. Maybe the person was upset, but the author didn't do anything wrong by sticking to their plan.\n\nAlso, the author offered to watch another movie on another day, which is a good offer. So they accommodated the possibility of the group wanting something else in the future. So the author isn't being inconsiderate, just firm on their own choice for their personal event.\n\nIn social situations, people have the right to make plans for their own events. Unless it's a group event where everyone agrees, one person's preference shouldn't override the host's choice. The group agreed to come, except for one person. The author isn't in the wrong here. The person who left might be overreacting or not respecting the author's choice. \n\nSo the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
