I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person asked if they're the asshole for not changing the movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, saying it's optional. When someone suggested a different movie, the author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that one. The friend then backed out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and boundaries. The author made it clear it's optional for others to join. When someone objected, the author stood by their choice. The friend wasn't happy and left, but was the author wrong?\n\nI think when you invite people to an event you're hosting, you have the right to choose the details, like the movie. The friend's suggestion to change might come from wanting to have a different experience or maybe they're not into that genre. But the author made it clear it's their choice. \n\nBut maybe the friend felt ignored, but the author didn't force them to come. The problem is that the friend wanted a different movie, but the author didn't budge. However, since the author emphasized it's optional, then the friend's choice to leave is their own. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their preference for their own event. The friend's reaction might have been over the top, but the author isn't obligated to change their plans for others. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
