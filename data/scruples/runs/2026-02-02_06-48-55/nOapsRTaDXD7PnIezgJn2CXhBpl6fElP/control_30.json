I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole in the situation where they didn't change the movie they wanted for their birthday. They chose How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted it in the group chat, and said it's optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, and then that person backed out and stopped talking.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to stick with their choice. First, it was their birthday, so they have the right to choose how to celebrate. They made it clear the movie was optional, so people could opt out. The person who suggested a different movie might have had a preference, but the author's response was polite, explaining it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that movie. The friend decided not to come, which is their choice. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to change their plans just because one person didn't like the movie. They even offered to see another movie on another day, which is a good compromise. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but the author isn't at fault here. It's about personal choice and the right to celebrate one's own birthday as they see fit. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
