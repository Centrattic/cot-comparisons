I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not changing the movie for their birthday. \n\nSo the setup: The author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday and invited friends via group chat. They made it clear it was optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped participating. Now the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday. They made it optional, so friends could opt out. The one person who objected could have said no, but instead tried to change the plan. The author stood by their choice, which is reasonable. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh\u2014maybe they were unhappy with the choice, but they were under no obligation to attend. The key points are: the author made it clear it was optional, they explained their preference, and the friend chose to leave. The author isn't wrong here. They had every right to pick their movie, and friends who don't like that choice can opt out. The friend's behavior might be the issue here, not the author's. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
