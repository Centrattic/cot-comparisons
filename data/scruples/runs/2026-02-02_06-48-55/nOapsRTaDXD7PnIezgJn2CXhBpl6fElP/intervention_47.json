I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend's request.\n\nFirst, the author planned to go to \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" and invited others in a group chat, saying it's optional. Most of the group agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they chose the movie, and the other person then decided not to come and stopped talking.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's point is that they wanted to celebrate their birthday with a movie they chose. They made it clear it's optional, so if others don't want to join, that's up to them. The friend who suggested changing the movie might have expected the author to compromise, but the author had the right to set their preference for their own celebration.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend felt hurt or wanted to spend more time together, so suggesting a different movie could be a way to include everyone. But the author shouldn't be forced to change their choice just because someone else wants something else. The key points are that the invitation was optional, the author had the right to choose their celebration, and the friend chose to leave, which is their prerogative too.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being inconsiderate or not respecting others' preferences can be a factor. But here, the author did make it optional, so those who didn't want to go could opt out. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing their plans. The friend's reaction might be a bit harsh, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's disappointment.\n"
