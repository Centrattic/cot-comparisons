I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So, they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, saying it's optional. Some friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal choice and how others reacted. The author made it clear the movie was optional, so the friends who agreed were okay with it. The one who suggested a different movie might have expected the author to be flexible. But the author was clear it's their birthday, so they have the right to choose. However, maybe the friend felt disrespected when the author didn't budge. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't force anyone to come. They invited people but said it's optional. If someone doesn't agree with the choice, they can just not come. The author isn't obligated to change the movie because someone else prefers a different one. On the other hand, maybe the way the author responded could have been more considerate. Like, acknowledging the friend's suggestion but still being firm. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction of not coming and stopping communication seems a bit harsh, but maybe that's on them. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing their plans when they've already set them, especially for their own birthday. They did offer an alternative (another movie another day), which shows they're open to other times. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made it optional, chose their movie, and the friend's disappointment doesn't necessarily make the author at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
