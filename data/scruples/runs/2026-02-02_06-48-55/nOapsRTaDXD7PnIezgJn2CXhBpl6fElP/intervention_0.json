I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it even when someone suggested a different movie. The person ended up not going after the author refused to change the movie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author organized the movie as a birthday party/gift to themselves. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it was optional to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it was their birthday and they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon. The person then backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nSo, the question is: Was the author in the wrong for not changing the movie? The possible answers are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI think the main factors here are the author's right to choose their own celebration and the other person's reaction. The author made it clear the event was optional, so those who chose to come were aware of the movie choice. The person who suggested changing the movie might have had a preference but didn't like the chosen movie, but the author had the right to decide since it was their birthday. The fact that the person left after the author didn't change the movie suggests that the issue was about differing preferences, not something more serious. The author isn't being inconsiderate because they allowed others to opt out and even suggested another day for a different movie. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
