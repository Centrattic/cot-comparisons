I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the person planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday gift. They posted in a group chat, made it clear it's optional, and most friends agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that person backed out.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author made it optional, communicated their choice clearly, and the friend had the option to not attend if the movie wasn't their preference. The author isn't forcing anyone to come. The friend might have felt their suggestion wasn't respected, but the author had the right to choose their own birthday movie. \n\nI think the key here is that the author wasn't being inconsiderate; they offered flexibility for another day. The friend's reaction might be overreacting, but the author isn't wrong for sticking to their choice. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
