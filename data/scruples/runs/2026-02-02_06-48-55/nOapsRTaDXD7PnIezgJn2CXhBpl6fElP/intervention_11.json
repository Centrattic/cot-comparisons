I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat that it was optional, most people agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author refused to change it, and the person backed out.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author clearly stated it was their birthday and they chose the movie. They made it optional, so others weren't obligated. The person who wanted a different movie didn't agree, but the author was firm in their choice. The person then decided not to attend and stopped participating in the chat.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main factors are the author's right to choose their own birthday activity, the optionality of attendance, and the other person's reaction. Since the author made it optional and the person had the choice to attend or not, the author isn't obligated to change their plans just because one person disagreed. The author wasn't forcing anyone to come; they just invited others. The person who left took their option to not attend, which is their right too. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about being considerate. The author could have offered to see another movie at another time, which they did. The person's insistence on changing the movie might have been a way to back out. The author's response was reasonable, maintaining their preference for their birthday. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they organized their own event with optional attendance, and the disinvited person chose to leave. The author had the right to choose their own celebration. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
