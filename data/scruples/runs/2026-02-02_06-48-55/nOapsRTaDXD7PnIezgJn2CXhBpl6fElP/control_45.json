I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person wanted to see \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\" for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat inviting others, mentioned it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, explaining it's their birthday and the movie they wanted. The person who suggested a different movie then said they wouldn't come and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the movie. The user wants a simple answer: A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me consider the dynamics here. The author made it clear it was their birthday and they chose the movie. They even offered to watch another movie another time. The other person's reaction seems a bit harsh\u2014pulling out entirely. The author isn't forcing anyone to attend; they invited people, but it was optional. The person who didn't come might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author had a right to choose their own celebration. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often get upset when they feel their preferences are overridden, but in this case, the author isn't forcing anyone. The movie choice is personal, and the author isn't making it a group decision. The other person might have felt disrespected if they expected a different movie, but the author was clear about it being their choice. \n\nHowever, maybe the issue is that the author didn't consider the group's preference. But since they said it's optional, the author isn't obligated to change their own plans. The other person's response of not attending might be a bit over the top, but the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their choice. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They made it clear it was their birthday, the movie was their choice, and attendance was optional. The other person's reaction is their own issue.\n"
