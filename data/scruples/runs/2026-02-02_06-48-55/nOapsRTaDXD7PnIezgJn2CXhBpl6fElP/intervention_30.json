I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is the asshole in the situation. The setup is that the person decided to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends via a group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused to change the movie, saying it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that one. Then the other person backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but wants to know my take. Let me break this down. The author invited people to their birthday movie, and clearly stated it's optional. The friends who wanted to come did, and one person didn't like the choice and left. The author's reasoning was that it's their birthday, so they should get to choose. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When it's someone's birthday, it's common for them to get to choose the activity, especially if they're inviting others. The author made it optional, so the friends weren't obligated to come. The one person who didn't want to see the movie could have just said they wouldn't come but didn't need to pressure the author to change the movie. However, the other person's reaction was to back out and stop participating in the group chat. That might be seen as a bit dramatic, but maybe they felt uncomfortable or uninterested. \n\nThe key points are: the author set the terms (optional), others agreed, then one person tried to change it. The author stood their ground, which is their right. The other person's response was to not attend and disengage. Is the author at fault here? It depends on context. If the author had made it a party where others were expected to contribute or choose the activity, then maybe. But since it was their idea and they stated it's optional, they have the right to choose. The friend might have been expecting a different movie, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for not changing their plan. \n\nThe user mentioned that the author wanted it to be their birthday gift to themselves, which is a valid reason. The friend's reaction could be a personal choice, not necessarily because of the author's fault. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format often looks at whether the person was considerate. The author was considerate by making it optional and inviting others. The friend didn't have to come, but maybe they were upset because they had different preferences. However, the author isn't in the wrong for not accommodating a last-minute change request when others were already okay with it. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made it clear the movie was optional, others joined, and the one who didn't like it chose to leave. The author had every right to pick their own movie for their birthday.\n"
