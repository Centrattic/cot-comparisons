I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday.\n\nSo, the scenario: The person is turning 20 and decides to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3 as a birthday treat. They invited friends via group chat, mentioned it's optional, most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that specific movie, and that they could do another movie another day. Then the person who suggested the change backed out and stopped talking in the group chat. The author is now questioning if they should have caved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear it's optional, so attending wasn't required. They chose the movie for their own birthday, which is a personal event. The friend suggested a different movie, but the author had the right to pick their own movie. The friend then decided not to come, which is their choice. The author didn't force anyone to attend, so they aren't at fault for not changing the movie. The friend's actions were their own decision, and the author didn't overstep by sticking to their choice. The main issue here seems to be the friend's reaction, not the author's decision. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
