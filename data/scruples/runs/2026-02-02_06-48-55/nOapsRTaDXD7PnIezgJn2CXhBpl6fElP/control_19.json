I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday celebration. They set up a movie night with friends, picked How to Train Your Dragon 3, and when someone suggested a different movie, they refused and the person left.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user clearly stated it was their birthday and they had the right to choose the movie. They made it optional for others to join. The friend suggested a different movie, but the user stood by their choice. The friend then decided not to attend, which is their choice too.\n\nIs the user at fault? Well, they were explicit about it being their birthday and their choice. The friend had the option to come or not. The user didn't force anyone to attend or to watch the movie. The friend's reaction might be about their own expectations, but the user isn't obligated to change their plans for others. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
