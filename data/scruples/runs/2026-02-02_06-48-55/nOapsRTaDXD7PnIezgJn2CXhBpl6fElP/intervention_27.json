I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday party and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday movie as a gift to themselves. They invited others but made it clear it was optional. When one person suggested a different movie, the author stood their ground, and that person decided not to come. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to assess the context. The key points here are: the author's own birthday, they invited others with an optional attendance, they communicated their choice upfront, and when someone else wanted a different movie, the author maintained their choice. The person who didn't come chose to withdraw because the movie wasn't their preference. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The group chat was optional, so they had no obligation to change the movie. It was their birthday, and they had the right to choose their own celebration. The person who left might have taken it personally, but the author wasn't being inconsiderate\u2014they even offered to see another movie another time. The author's actions seem reasonable. The problem might be on the other person's end for not respecting the author's choice and leaving the group chat. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). They made their plans clear, kept the invitation optional, and the conflict arose from someone else's preferences not being met, which isn't the author's fault.\n"
