I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and sticking to it despite a friend's objection.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday. They posted in a group chat, making it optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted to see that movie. The person then backed out and left the group chat. The author is now questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nSo, the key points: The author made it clear it was their choice and emphasized it's their birthday. They offered to do another movie another time. The friend didn't like the choice and left. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong to stick with their movie.\n\nI need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The question is whether it's reasonable to insist on their movie choice for their own birthday. The author made it optional, so if others didn't want to go, that's their choice. The friend could have chosen not to attend instead of pushing for a different movie. The author had the right to pick their own birthday movie. The friend's reaction might be overreacting. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer should be B.\n"
