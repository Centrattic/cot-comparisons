I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone else suggested a different one. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person wanted to celebrate their 20th birthday by watching How to Train Your Dragon 3. They invited friends via group chat, making it clear it's optional. Most agreed, but one person wanted a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it was their choice and the birthday movie. The other person then backed out and stopped chatting. The author is now unsure if they should have compromised.\n\nSo, the key points here are: It's the author's birthday, they made it optional, and they had the right to choose the movie. The friend didn't have to come if they weren't comfortable with the choice. The author didn't force anyone to attend; it was optional. The friend left, which is their choice, but the author is questioning if they were wrong for not changing the movie.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Usually, when someone's hosting an event for their own celebration, they have the autonomy to make the decisions. The friend's reaction might be a bit strong, but the author isn't obligated to change their choice just because one person disagrees. However, maybe the friend felt disrespected? But the author was clear it was their choice from the start.\n\nAlso, the author offered an alternative, saying they could see another movie another day. That seems like a reasonable compromise. The friend's response was to withdraw, which is their right. The author isn't in the wrong here because they had the final say on their own celebration. The friend's actions were their choice after the author explained their stance.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made it optional, were clear about their choice, and the friend left voluntarily. The author can't be blamed for not changing their decision once it's their own event.\n"
