I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the situation is that the author wanted to go see a movie for their 20th birthday, specifically How to Train Your Dragon 3. They posted in a group chat, saying people could join if they wanted, but it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. Then the person who suggested the change backed out and stopped talking to the group.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole here. They think maybe they are, but want another opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author organized the event for their own birthday. They made it clear that attending was optional. The person who objected is a minority of one. The author had the right to choose their own celebration, especially since it's their birthday. However, maybe the person who left felt disrespected? But the author didn't force anyone to come; they just asked if people wanted to join. The dissenting person might have felt their preference wasn't considered, but since the author is the one celebrating their birthday, it's reasonable for them to have the final say. The person who left could have chosen to attend or not, but they might have taken it personally. \n\nAnother angle: the author was respectful by saying it's optional, and when challenged, they explained their reasoning. The other person then decided not to attend. The author isn't obligated to change their plans for someone else's comfort. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that the person who suggested changing the movie might have had a reason\u2014like not liking the movie, or perhaps there was an underlying issue. However, the author didn't have to accommodate that. It's their birthday, so they have the right to choose. The person who left could have just not attended without making a big deal. The author's response was appropriate. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They made it clear it's optional and it's their choice for their own birthday. The other person's reaction seems to be their own issue, not the author's fault.\n"
