I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if they were in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited friends, but when one person suggested a different movie, they refused and that friend didn't come anymore.\n\nFirst, the user set up the movie as their own birthday party/gift to themselves. They posted it in a group chat, made it optional, and most people agreed. Then one friend suggested another movie, and the user stood their ground. The friend then backed out. The user is now questioning if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFrom a social perspective, when you're organizing a personal event, you have the right to choose the details, especially since you're the one hosting. The user made it clear it was optional, so those who came were there by choice. The friend's suggestion might have been a way to compromise, but the user didn't feel the need to change their plan. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, leaving because their suggestion wasn't accepted. \n\nHowever, maybe the user could have asked if the friend wanted to join the movie night first before the suggestion. But the user did make it optional, so maybe the friend was just trying to find a way out. The user's right to choose their own celebration isn't wrong. Friends should respect that unless there's a bigger issue. The user isn't in the wrong here because they made it clear it was their choice and it was optional for others. The friend's reaction is more about their own preferences not being accommodated, which isn't the user's fault.\n"
