I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong (AITA) for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends to join, making it optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then didn't come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: They organized the event, made it clear it's optional, and communicated their preference. They didn't force anyone to attend or agree to a different movie. The friend who objected had a choice not to come, which they did. The author's response was polite, explaining their reasoning without being confrontational.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the group chat the right place for such a discussion? Maybe, but since they were inviting friends to join, discussing the movie there makes sense. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh\u2014stopping talking in the group chat might be an overreaction. The author isn't wrong for wanting to celebrate their birthday on their terms. Compromise was offered (another movie another day), but the friend didn't accept. The author isn't obligated to change their preference just because someone else prefers something else. The key points are the author's right to choose their own celebration and the optional nature of the invitation. The friend's choice to not attend is their prerogative, but it doesn't make the author wrong for not altering the plan. So the answer is B.\n"
