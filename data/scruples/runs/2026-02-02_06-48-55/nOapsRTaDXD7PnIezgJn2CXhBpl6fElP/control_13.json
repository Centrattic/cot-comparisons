I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So the situation is that they wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted it in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie, then the person backed out and stopped talking.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal choice and social dynamics. The user clearly stated it's their birthday and they wanted to pick the movie. They also made it clear that attending was optional. The other person might have felt their suggestion wasn't considered, but the user had the right to choose their own preference. However, maybe the other person felt excluded or that their input was ignored, leading them to leave.\n\nBut the user didn't force anyone to come. They said it was optional. If someone didn't like the choice, they could have not attended without the movie being the reason to stop talking. The user's choice isn't inherently wrong if they made it clear it's their preference. The other person's reaction seems harsh, but the user might need to consider if their response was empathetic enough. But from the description, the user stood by their choice, which is reasonable. So the answer would probably be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
