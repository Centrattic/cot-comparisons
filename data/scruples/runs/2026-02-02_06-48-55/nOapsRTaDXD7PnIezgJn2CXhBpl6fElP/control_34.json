I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it was optional, most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused and the person left the chat.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are that the author made it clear the movie was optional, and it was their birthday. They invited people, and the majority agreed. The one person who didn't like the movie choice decided not to come. The author didn't force anyone to attend or watch the movie; they just chose their own preference. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions often look at whether someone was unreasonable or dismissive of others' feelings. In this case, the author was firm but polite, explaining their choice and suggesting another movie for another day. The other person had the option to not attend if they didn't like the movie. The author didn't shut them down or make it a big issue. \n\nSo, it seems like the author is in the right. They had the right to choose their own birthday movie. The other person's reaction might be a bit harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice. The answer should be B.\n"
