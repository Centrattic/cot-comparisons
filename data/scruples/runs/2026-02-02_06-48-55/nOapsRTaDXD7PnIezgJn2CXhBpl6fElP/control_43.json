I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they planned to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3 as their birthday movie, invited friends, and when one person suggested a different movie, the author refused, leading that person to back out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author explicitly stated it was their birthday and chose the movie. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. The friend suggested changing the movie, but the author stood by their choice. The friend then decided not to attend. The question is whether the author was wrong for not accommodating the friend's request.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about whether the person acted unreasonably. The author's actions seem reasonable because it's their birthday, and they had the right to choose their celebration. They also gave others the option to opt out. The friend's reaction might be more about not getting their way rather than the author being in the wrong. Unless there was some prior agreement or the friend felt forced to attend, the author isn't at fault. The friend's decision to leave is their choice, not a reflection of the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
