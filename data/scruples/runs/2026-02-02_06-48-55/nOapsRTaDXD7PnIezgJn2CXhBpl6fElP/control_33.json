I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday when a friend wanted a different one. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person decided to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday, posted in a group chat, said it's optional to join. Most people agreed, but one friend suggested changing the movie. The person refused, stating it's their birthday and the movie they picked. The friend then didn't come and stopped chatting. Now the person is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The person clearly stated it's their birthday movie choice, and they made it optional. The friend had the option to not come if they didn't like the movie. The person didn't force others to attend, so they aren't obligated to change plans. It's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how they celebrate. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but the person isn't in the wrong for standing by their choice. They even offered to see another movie another day, which is considerate. \n\nNo one is forced to spend time with others, even in group plans. The author made it clear upfront, so the friend who left was free to decline. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're celebrating their own day as they see fit. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
