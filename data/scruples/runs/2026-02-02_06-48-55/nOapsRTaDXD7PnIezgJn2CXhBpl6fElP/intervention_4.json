I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario is about choosing a movie for their birthday and others getting upset when they didn't change it.\n\nFirst, the person planned to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday choice, and offered to watch another movie another time. The person who suggested the change left the group chat.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong for not changing the movie. Let's break it down. The author clearly stated it's their birthday and they chose the movie. They also made it optional, so others weren't obligated to come. The person who wanted a different movie didn't get their way, but the author stood by their choice. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and boundaries. It's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how to celebrate. The others could have chosen not to come, which they did. The person who suggested changing the movie might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author wasn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own choice. The problem here might be the friend who reacted negatively, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for sticking to their plan. They even offered an alternative. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
