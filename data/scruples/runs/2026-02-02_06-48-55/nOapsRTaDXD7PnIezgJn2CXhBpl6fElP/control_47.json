I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends via group chat, making it optional. Most agreed, but one friend suggested a different movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then decided not to come and stopped participating in the chat.\n\nThe key points here are the initial invitation being optional, the friend's suggestion after agreeing, and the author standing by their choice. The friend chose not to attend after the suggestion was declined. The author isn't forcing others to attend; they just wanted to see the movie they chose. The friend's reaction seems to be a personal choice after not getting their way. The author didn't pressure others beyond the initial optional invite, so it's hard to see them as wrong. The friend's decision to leave might be more about their own feelings rather than the author's fault. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
