I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to go see How to Train Your Dragon 3 because it was their 20th birthday, they posted in a group chat inviting others, said it's optional, most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really wanted to see that movie. Then that person decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat. Now the author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear it was optional for others to join. They chose the movie because it's their birthday, which is a personal event. They didn't pressure others but invited them. When someone suggested a different movie, the author stood by their choice. The other person then opted out. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to choose their own celebration. Since they said it's optional, others can choose not to attend if they disagree. The person who suggested another movie might have been trying to get the group to change plans, but since the author was clear it's their event, they have the autonomy. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation of compromise in group settings. However, the author specifically mentioned it's their birthday, so it's a personal choice. The other person's reaction might be overreacting, but the author isn't wrong for not changing the movie. They did offer an alternative (seeing another movie on another day), which shows they're open to future plans but firm on their birthday choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made their intentions clear, the event was optional, and the other person chose to leave. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
