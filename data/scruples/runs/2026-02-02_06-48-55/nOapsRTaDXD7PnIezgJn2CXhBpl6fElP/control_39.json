I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends, who mostly agreed. But one person suggested a different movie, the author refused, and that person backed out.\n\nFirst, the user is turning 20 and wanted to choose their own movie. They made it clear it was optional for others to join. So they had the right to choose their own celebration. The friend didn't like the choice and decided not to come. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else prefers a different movie. The friend had the choice to attend or not. The author didn't force anyone to come. The friend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but the author isn't wrong here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
