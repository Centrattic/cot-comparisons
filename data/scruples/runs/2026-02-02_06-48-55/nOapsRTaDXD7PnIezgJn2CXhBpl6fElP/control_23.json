I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie choice for their birthday.\n\nSo, the situation: They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their 20th birthday. They posted in a group chat, said it's optional, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The person then backed out and stopped chatting. Now the author is unsure if they should have changed it.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author was celebrating their own birthday, so they had the right to choose. They made it clear it was optional, so no one was obligated to come. The person who suggested a different movie might have had their own preferences, but the author was firm in their choice. The person then left, which is their choice too. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for wanting to pick their own movie for their birthday. They also communicated that it's optional, so the others aren't forced to attend. The other person's reaction is a bit harsh, maybe they were expecting the author to compromise, but the author isn't at fault for sticking to their preference. \n\nHowever, maybe the other person felt ignored or disrespected. But since the author made it clear it's their decision and that others can choose to join or not, it's within their rights. The author didn't make it a group decision but their own, which is okay for a personal event like a birthday. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to choose, and others could choose to participate or not. The problem wasn't with the author but with the other person's reaction.\n"
