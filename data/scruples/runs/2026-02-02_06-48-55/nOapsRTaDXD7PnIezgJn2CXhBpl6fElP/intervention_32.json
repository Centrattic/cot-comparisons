I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it when someone suggested a different one.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday, posted in a group chat that others could join if they wanted. Most people agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they wanted that specific movie, then the person who suggested it stopped coming and left the group chat.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong, but now wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI should consider the context. The author made it clear the movie was optional. They invited others, and the majority agreed. The one person who suggested a change didn't like the refusal and left. But the author didn't force anyone to come; it was optional. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's refusal unreasonable? Did they overstep by not changing the movie? The person who left had the choice to not attend. The author's birthday is a personal preference. However, maybe the person who left felt slighted. But in terms of right or wrong, the author wasn't obligated to change their plans since it's their birthday. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about communication. The author should have considered if the movie choice was something others might not like. But since they said it's optional, and most people agreed, the author isn't wrong for sticking to their choice. The person who left made a choice not to come after the author didn't comply with their suggestion. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they set the terms as optional, and the majority went along. The person who left is the one choosing to not participate. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
