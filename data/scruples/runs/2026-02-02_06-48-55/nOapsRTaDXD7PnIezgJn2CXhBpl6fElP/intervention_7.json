I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and someone else wanted to change it.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated it was their birthday and they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3. They made it optional for others to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and that person left the group chat.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are that it was the author's birthday, they made the movie choice clear, and participation was optional. The person who wanted to change the movie had the option to not attend but chose to object instead. The author wasn't forcing anyone to come; they were simply celebrating their own birthday. The other person's reaction seems a bit extreme since it was their own choice to participate. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more accommodating, but the person was in the minority. Since the majority were okay with the choice, and the author made it clear it was optional, it's hard to see how the author is at fault. The other person decided not to show up after realizing they couldn't change the plan. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's their birthday and they have the right to choose how they want to celebrate.\n"
