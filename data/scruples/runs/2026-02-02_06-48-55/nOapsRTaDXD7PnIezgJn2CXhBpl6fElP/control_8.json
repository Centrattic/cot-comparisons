I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional for others to join. Some people agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author refused, saying it's their birthday and they really want that movie. Then that person backed out and stopped talking in the group.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author made it clear it's their birthday choice and that others aren't obligated to come. They stated it's optional. The person who objected might have had their own preferences, but the author was clear it's their choice. The fact that the other person left after not getting their way seems like their own decision. The author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the other person felt ignored or disrespected? The author did offer to do another movie another day, so they weren't being exclusive. The author's actions seem reasonable. It's their birthday, so they have the right to choose how to celebrate. The objection from the other person might be about not liking the movie, but the author isn't required to cater to everyone's preferences. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They set boundaries, made it optional, and stuck by their choice. The other person's reaction might be their own issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
