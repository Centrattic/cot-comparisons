      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully again. \n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends via group chat, saying it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The user then said it was their birthday and it was the movie they picked, and that they could do another movie another time. The person who suggested a different movie then decided not to come and stopped talking in the group chat. Now the user is unsure if they should have changed the movie.\n\nFirst, the user made it clear from the start that attending was optional. So, people could choose to come or not. They did ask if others wanted to join, but it wasn't a commitment. When one person objected to the movie, the user stood by their choice, which is their right since it's their birthday. However, the person who objected then decided not to come. That person might have felt disrespected or that their preference wasn't considered, even though the user had already stated their choice. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The user set the terms as optional from the beginning. 2) The person who objected might have felt that their input was ignored, leading them to withdraw. 3) The user is now questioning if they should have been more flexible. \n\nIn many cases, when planning a social event, especially one that's personal like a birthday, the host usually has the final say on the main details (like the movie in this case). However, if the group dynamic relies on mutual participation and compromise, maybe the user could have considered alternatives. But the user explicitly said it was optional, so maybe the others who agreed knew to come as they are. The one person who objected didn't have to come, but perhaps their suggestion was a way to find a middle ground. \n\nBut wait, the user was the one hosting, and it's their birthday. It's reasonable to expect that others would respect their choice, especially since they made it optional. However, if the person who objected had strong feelings, maybe the user could have asked earlier for movie suggestions instead of picking one and then not being open to discussion. But the user did invite people and gave them the option to join, so maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the person who objected might have felt that their preference was overlooked, leading to tension. If the user had been more open to discussion initially, maybe they could have found a compromise. But the user already stated it was their choice, so they might not be at fault. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they made it optional and clear from the start. They had the right to choose their movie for their birthday. The person who objected didn't have to come. The user isn't obligated to change their plans if others have differing preferences. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
