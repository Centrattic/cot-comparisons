I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they are the asshole for not changing the movie they picked for their birthday. The situation is that they wanted to watch How to Train Your Dragon 3, invited people through a group chat, said it's optional, most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author responded that it was their choice for the day, and then the person didn't come and stopped talking.\n\nHmm. So first, the user set up the movie as their birthday party/gift to themselves. They did ask if others wanted to join, and made it clear it's optional. The majority agreed, but one person disagreed. The author didn't budge, and that person left. Now the user is wondering if they should have changed the movie.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are whether the author was being unreasonable by not changing the movie despite someone's suggestion. Since it was their birthday and they made it optional, they have the right to choose. The person who didn't come was free to decline. The author's response was firm but polite, offering to see another movie another day. The others in the group still came, so the author's choice didn't ruin the party. The person who left seems to be the one who didn't respect the author's choice. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
