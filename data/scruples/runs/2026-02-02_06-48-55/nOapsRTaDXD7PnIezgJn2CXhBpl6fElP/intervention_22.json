I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after being asked to join.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends. They made it clear it's optional. Most friends agreed, but one suggested a different movie. The author stood their ground, saying it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then backed out and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nThe key points here are the context of a birthday celebration, the option given to friends (it's optional), and the friend's reaction. The author didn't force anyone to attend, just extended an invitation. When someone questioned the choice, they clearly stated it's their decision. The friend's choice to not attend is their own decision, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Birthdays are personal, and people often have specific preferences. The author wasn't being exclusive or pushy beyond their own choice. They even offered to see another movie another day, which shows flexibility. The friend might have felt their input wasn't considered, leading to them opting out. But was the author in the wrong? They didn't coerce or make attending mandatory. The friend had the option to accept or decline the invitation as it was presented.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author was clear about their choice and the optional nature. The friend's dissatisfaction might stem from not feeling heard, but the author maintained their stance, which is valid when it's their own event. It's about balancing personal preference with group dynamics. However, the author isn't obligated to cater to everyone's preferences. It's their birthday, so their choice should take precedence unless there was prior agreement otherwise.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have considered the group's preferences more. But the scenario states they asked if anyone wanted to join, making it optional. The friend's suggestion could be a test of the author's resolve. The author was respectful in declining the suggestion and kept the door open for other times. That seems reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they made the event optional, clearly stated their preference, and didn't force anyone to attend. The friend's choice to leave was their own decision. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because one person wanted a different movie. So, answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
