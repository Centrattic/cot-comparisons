I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the person choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite someone else's request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author invited people to their birthday movie, made it clear it was optional, and most people agreed. Then one person suggested changing the movie, but the author declined, explaining it's their birthday and they want to see that specific movie. The person who suggested changing it then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were wrong for not changing the movie. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they had the right to choose their birthday activity, especially since they made it optional. They offered to watch another movie another day, which shows flexibility. The other person's reaction seems a bit harsh since they just left without attending. However, maybe the author could have considered the other person's feelings more? But the author clearly communicated it was their choice, and the other person had the option to not attend. \n\nIs there a cultural norm here? Sometimes, if someone invites others, they might expect some compromise, but since it's the author's birthday, they have the right to set the terms. The other person might have felt ignored, but the author didn't force them to attend. \n\nI think the key here is the author made it clear it was optional. The other person had the choice to attend or not. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing their plans, especially for their own birthday. The other person's reaction is their own issue. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
