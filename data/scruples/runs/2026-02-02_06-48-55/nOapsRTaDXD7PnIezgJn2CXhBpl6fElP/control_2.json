I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. They went ahead and picked How to Train Your Dragon 3, posted in a group chat, said it's optional, and most people agreed. But one person wanted to pick a different movie, and when the user refused, that person bailed and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, the user's situation: it's their birthday, they wanted to see a specific movie, and they made it clear it's optional. They even offered to do another day with another movie if others wanted. The person who objected didn't back down and left. The user is now wondering if they were wrong to stick with their choice.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. The user organized the event for their birthday. They had a right to choose the movie since it's their celebration. They also made it optional, so others weren't obligated to come. The person who objected could have chosen not to attend instead of making a scene. The user stood their ground, which is reasonable because it's their special day. The other person's reaction seems a bit over the top. They could have either accepted the movie or just skipped the event, but instead, they tried to change the plans and then left, which might have caused unnecessary tension.\n\nAlso, the user didn't force anyone to come; they just invited. So by not changing the movie, they didn't wrong anyone. The person who wanted a different movie might have felt entitled to influence the choice, but the user's right to decide their own party's details is valid. There's no indication that the user was unreasonable beyond wanting to see a movie they like on their birthday. The other person's behavior seems more like a personal preference disagreement leading to withdrawal, which isn't the user's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had the right to choose the movie for their own birthday, and the other person's response was their own choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
