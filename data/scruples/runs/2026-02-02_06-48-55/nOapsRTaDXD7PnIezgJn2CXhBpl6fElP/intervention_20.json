I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend's objections.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author planned a movie for their birthday, posted it in a group chat, and said it's optional. Most people agreed, but one friend suggested changing the movie. The author refused, explaining it's their birthday and they wanted that movie. The friend then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author made it clear it's their birthday gift to themselves and that the movie was their choice. They emphasized it's optional for others to join. The friend who objected might have felt their preference wasn't respected, but the author had already stated it's their decision. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force anyone to come; they gave the option to join or not. The friend chose not to attend after the movie choice wasn't changed. The author didn't make the friend come, so the friend's withdrawal is their choice. The author's stance seems reasonable since it's their birthday. They communicated clearly, so it's hard to say they're at fault here. The friend might have felt slighted, but the author isn't obligated to change plans if it's their special day. \n\nPossible angles: Maybe the friend felt ignored, but the author tried to be accommodating by suggesting another day. The friend's response was to stop talking entirely, which might be an overreaction. The author's actions don't seem malicious; they just wanted to celebrate their way. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
