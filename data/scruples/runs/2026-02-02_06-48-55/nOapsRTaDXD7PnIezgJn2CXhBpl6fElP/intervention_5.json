I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and others getting upset when they didn't switch it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person organized the movie as their birthday celebration, posted in a group chat, said it's optional to join. Most people agreed, but one person suggested changing the movie. The author refused, stating it's their birthday and they chose the movie. That person then backed out and stopped communicating.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They made it clear it was optional, so people could choose not to come. The person who wanted a different movie might have different preferences, but the author had the right to pick the movie for their own birthday. Insisting on their choice isn't necessarily wrong, especially since they were clear it's optional. The other person's reaction of not attending and cutting off communication might be their own issue. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else doesn't like the choice, especially since others did agree. So, the answer is B.\n"
