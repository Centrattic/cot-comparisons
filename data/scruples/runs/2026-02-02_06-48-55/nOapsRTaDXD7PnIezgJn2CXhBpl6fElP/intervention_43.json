I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and not changing it despite a friend suggesting a different one.\n\nFirst, the author planned their own birthday party, chose the movie, and made it clear it was optional. They invited friends via group chat, and most agreed. Then one person suggested changing the movie. The author stood their ground, explaining it's their birthday and they want to see that movie. The friend then decided not to come and stopped participating in the group chat.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author is celebrating their own birthday, so they have the right to choose the activity. They made it optional, so others aren't obligated to attend. The friend had the option to decline if they didn't like the movie choice. The author didn't force anyone to come. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Did the author consider the friend's feelings? But the friend didn't express a problem until after being invited. The author already stated the movie choice upfront. The friend's reaction of not showing up and stopping communication might be more about the friend's own feelings rather than the author's fault. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have offered an alternative, but they did say they could see another movie another time. That shows they're open to future plans but not for this specific event. The author isn't wrong for sticking to their choice on their birthday. The friend's withdrawal is their own choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They organized their event, made it optional, and didn't coerce anyone. The friend didn't have to attend. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
