I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the movie they chose for their birthday. So, the situation is that they wanted to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 and invited friends to join. They made it optional, but when one friend suggested a different movie, the user said it was their choice because it's their birthday. The friend then backed out and stopped talking in the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user made the invitation clear that it was optional. So, even if someone disagreed with the movie choice, they could still attend or not. The user is celebrating their birthday, which is a personal event. Choosing a movie for such an occasion is a personal preference. The friend who objected then decided not to come, but that's their choice. The user didn't force anyone to come; they just made the choice that suited them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. The key points here are consent, personal choice, and boundaries. The user had the right to choose how they wanted to spend their birthday. The friend who objected could have attended the movie and then suggested another time for a different movie, but they chose not to. The user isn't obligated to change their plans because of someone else's preference, especially when they've already communicated that it's optional.\n\nAnother angle is group dynamics. Maybe the user expected more flexibility, but they clearly stated it was optional. The friend's reaction might be more about their own preferences rather than a valid grievance. The user's response was polite, explaining that it's their birthday and suggesting another time. The friend's decision to stop talking in the group chat might be a bigger issue on their part, indicating maybe they felt disrespected, but that's their reaction, not necessarily the user's fault.\n\nIn many similar situations, people are often advised to respect others' choices, especially in personal events. The user is within their rights to choose how they celebrate their own birthday. The fact that the friend left the conversation doesn't make the user wrong; it's more about the friend's decision to not participate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They made their intentions clear, respected others' choice to not attend by making it optional, and stood by their preference for the movie on their birthday. The friend's actions don't reflect on the user's wrongdoing.\n"
