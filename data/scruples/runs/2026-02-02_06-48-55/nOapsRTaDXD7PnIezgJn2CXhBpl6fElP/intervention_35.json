I said its completely optional if you want to join me. \n\nmost of the group agreed and I was happy. \nThat was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nAfter realising they wouldn't change my mind they told me they weren't coming and stopped talking in the group chat. \n\nI'm now unsure if I should have changed the movie or not.\n\nAITA?\n\nand just incase anyone asks, I like how to train your dragon because it's a good movie. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing a movie for their birthday and some friends not showing up after suggesting a different movie.\n\nFirst, the author planned to see How to Train Your Dragon 3 for their birthday and invited friends. They made it clear it was optional. Most agreed, but one person suggested a different movie. The author stood by their choice, and the friend backed out.\n\nSo, the key points: the author's choice was their birthday, they communicated it's optional, the friend wanted a different movie but didn't commit to going. The author didn't change the plan and the friend left the group chat.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had the right to choose their own movie for their birthday, especially since they made it optional. The friend had the choice to come or not. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because someone else prefers a different movie. The friend's actions were their own decision. The author didn't force anyone to come. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were clear, and the friend had the option to attend or not. The author's choice is valid, and the friend's disappointment doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
