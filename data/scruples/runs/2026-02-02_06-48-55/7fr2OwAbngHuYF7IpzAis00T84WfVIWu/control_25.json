My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in a 20-year marriage. He mentions that he married his wife because he was lonely and afraid of being alone, but his heart wasn't in it. He felt trapped. Now, after years of marriage and two kids, he developed depression and sought therapy. Through therapy, he's learning to understand his feelings better.\n\nNow, the key issue is that he no longer wants to be touched by his wife. He feels hollow and trapped when she touches him. But he's also scared of ending the marriage. Recently, he developed feelings for a female friend who's about 40. This new connection made him realize that a post-marriage life might be happy for him. So he started pulling away from his wife physically, which caused her distress.\n\nThe wife is devastated and wants to know why he changed. The author is conflicted between not wanting to go back to his previous state (which he disliked) and not wanting to end the marriage over a \"passing crush.\" But he feels the change is real and not temporary.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's at fault. Let's consider the dynamics. The author has been in a marriage that he didn't fully commit to, leading to emotional distance. His depression and therapy have helped him realize his feelings. The issue is his physical withdrawal and the new attraction. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be touched by your spouse after years of feeling that way? If he's been avoiding touch for a while but recently stopped hiding it, maybe the problem is communication. He didn't talk to his wife about his feelings of emptiness and fear instead of just pulling away. His sudden change without explanation has hurt her. \n\nAlso, developing feelings for someone else while married is a problem. Even if it's not a physical affair, the emotional connection could be seen as cheating. But he hasn't left the marriage yet. However, the fact that he's considering ending it because of this new connection might make him at fault. \n\nBut wait, he mentions he's in therapy and learning to cooperate with his emotions. Maybe his feelings are legitimate. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without open communication with his wife\u2014could be the issue. The wife feels abandoned or rejected when he pulls away, and she's confused. He hasn't given her a chance to address the issues in their marriage first. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If the problem is the physical avoidance and the new relationship, then yes. But if the root is his unresolved feelings and lack of communication, then maybe he's not entirely at fault. But in a marriage, both partners should work on issues. If he's been feeling this way for years but only recently acted on it, perhaps the wrong is in how he's handling the situation rather than the feelings themselves. \n\nBut the act of pulling away without explanation and seeking emotional connection with another person while married is problematic. So maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the marriage was already broken, maybe not. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife and acting on feelings for someone else. \n\nIn many cultures, emotional and physical infidelity are considered breaches of trust. Even if he hasn't physically cheated, the emotional connection could be seen as wrong. Additionally, not communicating his needs to his wife before withdrawing completely might have caused unnecessary harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's emotionally connecting with another person while married without addressing the issues in his current marriage first, and he's not communicating his needs to his wife, leading to her distress. But I'm a bit torn because his feelings might be genuine, but the way he's handling it is problematic. I think the key is that he's not being transparent, which is part of the problem.\n"
