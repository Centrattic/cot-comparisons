My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a husband who's been married almost 20 years. He says they married because they were both lonely and scared of being alone. He wasn't sure about the marriage at the time, but went through with it. Now, he's dealing with depression and has been in therapy. He's realizing he doesn't like being with his wife and feels trapped when she touches him. He's also developed feelings for a friend, which made him consider ending the marriage. He's been pulling away from his wife, which is hurting her. He's conflicted between staying in the marriage out of fear of ruining 20 years and a family, or being honest about his feelings.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The marriage started on shaky ground, both entering it out of fear of being alone. The husband's mental health struggles are a big part\u2014depression and suicidal thoughts, which he addressed through therapy. Now, he's becoming more self-aware and realizes he's unhappy in the marriage. The physical rejection (pulling away from touch) is causing his wife distress, which he acknowledges.\n\nHe mentions a new friend where he feels a spark. This might be a factor in his change of heart. But he's not acting on the affair, just the emotional shift. He's not having an affair yet, just emotional intimacy with the friend.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong for not wanting to be touched? Marital relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he's been hiding his feelings for years and now is being honest, maybe he's not wrong. But suddenly pulling away without communication could be hurtful. He says he's not hiding anymore, but his wife is struggling to understand the change. The key here is whether he's being honest about his feelings in a respectful way. However, emotional infidelity is a factor here\u2014developing feelings for someone else while married can be considered wrong, as it breaches trust.\n\nBut the question is specifically about not wanting to touch his wife. If the underlying issue is a lack of emotional connection and he's now being honest, then maybe it's not his fault. However, the fact that he's developing feelings for another woman complicates it. The act of forming an emotional connection with someone else while in a committed relationship is generally seen as a breach of trust, which could make him at least partially at fault.\n\nAlso, the wife is described as being devastated and not understanding the sudden change. If he's been suppressing his feelings for years and now is acting on them, it's a big shift. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issues in the marriage earlier, leading to a sudden breakdown. But given the mental health aspects, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's taking therapy seriously and trying to be honest. But the emotional infidelity aspect is a red flag. The community might see his actions as justified if the marriage was unhappy and he's now being truthful, but others might argue that he should work on the marriage instead of seeking an exit. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, considering the emotional connection with another person and the physical rejection without prior communication, it's possible he is in the wrong. But the mental health angle adds nuance. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because developing feelings for someone else while married is a breach of commitment, and the sudden withdrawal from his wife without proper communication could be harmful.\n"
