My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether the person who wrote this post is at fault for not wanting to touch his wife anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man is married for 20 years, has two kids. He says they got married because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He wasn't fully committed at first but tried to make it work. Later, he went through depression and therapy, which helped him understand his feelings better. Now, he doesn't like being with his wife and feels trapped when she touches him. He's been avoiding physical contact recently, which has upset her. He also mentions developing a romantic interest in a friend, which makes him consider ending the marriage. He's conflicted between his feelings for his wife and his new emotions.\n\nSo, the key points are: the marriage was built on mutual fear of loneliness, the husband's recent emotional change due to therapy, avoidance of touch causing distress to the wife, and a possible affair with a friend. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife and considering divorce.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's past depression and therapy indicate that his current feelings might be part of his healing. He's being honest with himself, which could be important for his well-being. Avoiding touch might be a way to protect himself from emotional pain, but it's causing his wife distress. On the other hand, a marriage requires mutual respect and effort. If he's pulling away, it could be seen as neglecting his wife's emotional needs. Also, developing feelings for someone else before the marriage is over might complicate things. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize his own happiness? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel supported. If the marriage isn't fulfilling for him, maybe ending it isn't wrong. But he's been in the marriage for 20 years; sudden withdrawal of affection could be hurtful. The wife says he's the best thing that happened to her, so his actions are impacting her deeply. Also, the presence of children adds another layer\u2014how will this affect them?\n\nThe husband's reasons are based on his emotional state and realization. He's not acting out of malice but personal growth. However, communication is key. He should have addressed his feelings earlier instead of waiting until he started avoiding her. The fact that he's considering ending the marriage because of a new attraction might be problematic, as it could be impulsive. But if he genuinely feels trapped and the marriage was never fulfilling, maybe it's a necessary step.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many would say that a marriage should be worked on unless there are insurmountable issues. His avoidance of touch without explanation could be seen as neglectful. However, if his emotional state is such that he can't meet the expectations of a marriage anymore, maybe it's not entirely his fault. It's a tough situation where both parties have valid points.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions are considered as a responsible step towards his well-being or a betrayal of his wife's feelings. Since he's not in an affair yet but is considering divorce due to new feelings, it's a bit confusing. If he's honest with his wife and they try to work on it, that's one thing. But pulling away and not engaging in physical contact without addressing the root cause might be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe he's partly at fault for not communicating properly, but his emotional struggles are real. The answer might be a balance, but since the options are A or B, I have to choose. Given that he's not acting out of malice but is prioritizing his own mental health and the marriage was already lacking, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's handling the situation (sudden withdrawal without explanation) could be at fault. Hmm.\n"
