My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband doesn't want to touch his wife anymore, which is causing her distress. He's been married for 20 years, had a bad depression, and now he feels different after connecting with a friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband says he married her out of fear of being alone and wasn't fully committed. Now, after years, he's realized he doesn't feel the same. He's avoiding physical intimacy because it makes him feel trapped. His wife is hurt because he's pulling away suddenly.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting physical contact? Well, intimacy is a big part of marriage. If he's feeling this way, maybe he should communicate better. But he's been avoiding it before, and now he's being honest. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt. His wife might need more support and understanding.\n\nAlso, there's the new friend involved. The husband has feelings for someone else now, which complicates things. But he doesn't want to end the marriage over a \"crush.\" Still, the sudden change in behavior is hurting his wife. \n\nThe question is if he's in the wrong. He's not being physically affectionate anymore, which his wife wants. If he's not willing to communicate effectively or make an effort to address her needs, that could be wrong. On the other hand, if he's struggling with his feelings and can't force himself to be affectionate, that's a personal issue. \n\nBut marriages require both partners to work things out. If he's not willing to engage in efforts to maintain the relationship, even if it's difficult, that might be where the wrong lies. His actions are causing her pain, and he's not giving her the support she needs. Maybe he should seek couples therapy instead of just pulling away. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not handling the situation with the care it needs. He's being abrupt and not addressing his wife's feelings adequately, even if his own feelings are valid. He needs to work on the marriage or have a proper conversation about ending it, rather than just withdrawing.\n"
