My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's been married for 20 years, and he's been feeling disconnected from his wife for a while. He didn't want to touch her because it made him feel hollow and trapped. Then he started seeing another woman, an attractive and smart friend of his, and now he's pulling away from his wife more. His wife is devastated, and he's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to touch her anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He mentions that he married her out of fear of being alone and wasn't fully committed at first. Over time, he developed depression, which he only sought help for after a while. Therapy helped him understand his emotions better, and now he's realizing he doesn't want to be with his wife. The change in his behavior is because he's honest about his feelings now, but he's also in the early stages of a possible relationship with another woman.\n\nHe's conflicted because he doesn't want to end a 20-year marriage over a \"passing crush\" but also can't go back to how things were. His wife is hurt and doesn't understand the sudden change. The key here is whether his actions are justified. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. If he was suppressing his true feelings for years and now is expressing them, it's part of his growth. On the other hand, he's been married a long time, and his actions might be hurting his wife, especially if he's engaging with another woman. The fact that he's pulled away without clear communication could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHe says he doesn't want to kill the marriage over a crush, but his actions suggest he's already moving towards ending it. The question is whether not wanting to touch his wife is the wrong thing. Physical touch is a significant part of a marriage, and refusing it can be perceived as emotionally distant or neglectful. However, if he's genuinely feeling that way due to emotional disconnect and his therapy, maybe he's not at fault for changing his behavior once he's honest about his feelings.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the new relationship. If he's engaging with another woman, that might be a breach of marital trust even before it becomes physical. However, the question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. \n\nIt's complicated because he's trying to be truthful about his feelings, which is important, but the way he's communicating (or not communicating) and the impact on his wife is significant. Maybe he's not in the wrong for not wanting to touch her, but he's definitely in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and communication. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch her. If the answer is about the physical touch refusal alone, then maybe it's more about the emotional neglect. But if the act of pulling away without explanation is causing harm, then perhaps he is at fault.\n\nI'm leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because maintaining a marriage requires effort, and his sudden withdrawal without adequate communication can be hurtful. However, he's also dealing with genuine emotional issues. It's a tough call. Maybe he's not entirely in the wrong because he's seeking help and trying to be honest. But the way he's handling it could be better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch her. If that's a personal choice based on his therapy and emotional state, maybe not. But if it's neglectful, then yes. I'm a bit torn here. Considering all factors, maybe he's not in the wrong (B) because he's taking steps to address his feelings and is honest, even if the timing and communication could be better.\n"
