My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's been married for 20 years, had a long time of feeling trapped and not emotionally connected. He went into a depression but got therapy. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife and is pulling away. He's also developing a connection with another woman, which made him realize that maybe leaving the marriage could be a happy option.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author says he married her out of fear of being alone, so maybe the marriage wasn't fully consensual emotionally from his side. He felt trapped for a long time, which might mean the relationship wasn't healthy for him. But he stayed for 20 years and had two kids, so there's a lot of history here.\n\nHe's not in love with his wife anymore, but he's not entirely sure if his feelings for the other woman are solid. He mentions it's a \"spark\" and that they've met a few times and chat online. That might not be a strong enough foundation to justify ending a 20-year marriage. Also, he's using this as a reason to feel like leaving the marriage isn't so terrifying anymore. But is that a valid reason to pull away from his wife?\n\nHis wife is devastated. She thinks he's the best thing that ever happened to him. He's been avoiding her touch, which is a major change and causing her emotional pain. He's not communicating his feelings effectively, just pulling away. That's not fair to her. He should have talked to her about his issues before completely cutting off physical contact. Maybe if he had communicated, they could have worked on the marriage or at least made a mutual decision.\n\nHe's in therapy, which is good. Maybe he should involve his therapist in this situation to get guidance on whether he's ready to leave or if there's room for reconciliation. The fact that he's not hiding his feelings anymore is important, but he needs to approach this with responsibility towards his wife and kids. Ending a marriage is a big decision that affects everyone involved. He's considering it because of a possible new relationship, but that seems impulsive. It might be better to take more time to evaluate his feelings and the viability of both relationships.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's avoiding his wife's touch could be seen as a breach of trust and emotional neglect. Marriage requires effort from both sides, and if one partner is consistently unhappy and not working on the relationship, that's a problem. However, staying in an unhappy marriage can also be harmful. The key point is whether the author has made a good-faith effort to address the issues in his current marriage before seeking an alternative.\n\nHe hasn't mentioned any attempts to work on the marriage with his wife, like couples therapy. He's reacted to his own feelings without considering her perspective fully. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he's not handling the situation with the necessary communication and support for his wife and family. But there's also the argument that he's finally being honest with himself and his feelings. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of his wife's well-being without proper consideration and communication.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling this way, but the way he's handling it\u2014by pulling away without communication and potentially acting on a new crush\u2014could make him responsible for hurting his wife and not addressing the marriage's issues constructively. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the sudden withdrawal without trying to resolve the issues or considering the impact on his family.\n"
