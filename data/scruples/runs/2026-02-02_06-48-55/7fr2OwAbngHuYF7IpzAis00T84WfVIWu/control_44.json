My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is married for almost 20 years, with two kids. They mention marrying out of fear of being alone, which didn't sit well with them. There was a period of depression, and they got therapy. Now, they feel trapped when their wife touches them. Recently, they developed feelings for a friend, which made them realize they don't want to stay in the marriage. So they've been pulling away from their wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author married for fear, not love, and had a history of depression. They sought therapy, which helped them understand their emotions better. The change in behavior is because they're now being honest about their feelings. But the wife is upset and asks why the change happened suddenly. The author isn't sure if they're right to end the marriage over a crush, but they don't want to go back to how things were.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't cheat or act out. They're being honest about their feelings, which they've hidden before. However, the wife has invested 20 years and is now hurt. But the author's emotional state is a result of years of unhappiness and recent self-discovery. They might be in a place where the marriage isn't fulfilling for them anymore.\n\nBut is it fair to the wife? She's been supportive, even through the depression. Now, the author's pulling away without giving her a chance to address the issues? Maybe they should have communicated earlier. However, the author mentions that they've been feeling trapped for a long time and only now feel empowered to change it because of the new friend. Is it their fault for not addressing the issues earlier? Maybe they should have done that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now being honest. It's possible that the marriage wasn't working for them, and the wife might need to realize that as well. But the sudden change and the introduction of another person could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if there's no affair.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. They haven't acted on the feelings yet, just the attraction. If the author is finally being truthful about their feelings, even if it's painful for the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the way they're handling it could be considered abrupt and not giving the wife enough time to process or work on things.\n\nI think it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling what they do, but they might have a responsibility to handle the situation more carefully. However, since they're not acting on the feelings yet, just being honest about their lack of desire, maybe they're not at fault. The answer might be B (No), because the author is finally being honest about their feelings which they've suppressed for years, even though it's painful for the wife.\n"
