My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is a long-term marriage where the husband is struggling with emotional issues, depression, and now has feelings for another woman. He's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband married because of fear of being alone, which might have been a shaky foundation. He later developed depression and didn't share it, which could have affected their marriage. Now, after starting therapy, he's becoming more honest about his feelings but is also developing a crush. He's distancing himself from his wife, which is hurting her.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is dealing with legitimate emotional issues and is trying to be honest. He's not in the wrong for seeking help and addressing his feelings. On the other hand, his actions are causing pain to his wife, who feels abandoned. The question is whether being honest about his feelings makes him at fault.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions not wanting to end the marriage over a crush but is changing his behavior. Is it wrong to not hide his true feelings, even if it's hard on the wife? Or is he wrong for acting on a new interest without considering the long-term commitment he's in?\n\nMarital relationships require communication and mutual effort. If he's been suppressing his feelings for years and now is being honest, maybe that's necessary for his well-being. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away suddenly without open communication\u2014could be harmful. The wife might feel rejected, and the husband's new interest complicates things.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the marriage was already strained due to his past issues and lack of emotional presence, maybe it's time to move on. However, acting on a new crush could be seen as selfish. The husband is trying to prioritize his own happiness, which is understandable, but marriages involve compromise. The key is whether he's being fair and communicative.\n\nIn the end, the husband is in a tough spot. He's being honest about his feelings, which is good, but the timing and approach might be problematic. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's opening up about his true feelings and the marriage might not be fulfilling for either, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's causing unnecessary pain without considering the impact, perhaps he is. I think the answer is more nuanced, but according to the options, the choices are A or B. Given the context, the author might not be in the wrong because he's addressing his own needs and honesty is important, even if it's hard. So answer B.\n"
