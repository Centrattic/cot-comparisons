My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that he doesn't want to touch his wife anymore, and he's developed feelings for another woman. He and his wife have been married for 20 years, and he's been struggling with depression. He started therapy and realized he didn't really want to be in the marriage anymore. Now, he's pulling away from his wife physically, which is causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He mentions that the marriage started because both were lonely and scared of being alone. He wasn't fully committed at first. Over the years, they had kids, but he fell into depression. He got help through therapy, which made him more aware of his feelings. Now, he's found someone else he's attracted to, which made him realize that maybe leaving the marriage could be okay. However, he's conflicted because he doesn't want to end a 20-year marriage over a crush or a temporary phase.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional dynamics. He's been unhappy for a long time but only recently started acting on it. His wife is devastated by his withdrawal, and she sees him as the best thing that ever happened to her. The author is struggling with whether his actions are justified or if he's being selfish.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, staying in a marriage out of fear of being alone versus leaving because of genuine incompatibility or unhappiness is a complex issue. The author's therapist helped him understand his emotions, which suggests that his feelings are valid. However, acting on those feelings by emotionally withdrawing and potentially engaging in a relationship with another person is where the ethical dilemma lies.\n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She's been devoted for 20 years, and suddenly her husband is pulling away. She may feel abandoned or that her efforts weren't enough. The author's actions could be seen as breaking trust and causing unnecessary harm. Even if his feelings are real, the way he's handling it might be inconsiderate. He's not communicating his needs effectively, causing her distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that he's finally being honest about his true feelings and that staying in an unhappy marriage isn't fair to either of them in the long run. However, the fact that he's only just starting to act on these feelings now, especially after a long period of depression and therapy, complicates things. It's possible that the new attraction is a catalyst for him to realize his unhappiness, but it's also possible that he's using it as an excuse to leave.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the children. The author mentions they have two kids. Ending the marriage would affect them, but staying in an unhappy marriage can also have negative consequences for the children. However, the user hasn't provided details about the children's situation, so that's a bit of a grey area.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is being honest about his feelings, which is important. However, the way he's handling the transition is causing pain. Instead of pulling away suddenly, maybe he should have initiated a more open and honest conversation with his wife about his feelings and worked towards a mutual decision. By pulling away without communication, he might be seen as being inconsiderate and not taking responsibility for his wife's emotional well-being.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author might be in the wrong not because of his feelings themselves, but because of how he's handling the situation. It's important in a marriage to communicate and work through issues together, rather than withdrawing and causing harm. However, if the marriage was already unsatisfying and he's now acting on his true feelings, some might argue that he's right to seek a better life. But given the sudden change and the lack of communication, it's more likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
