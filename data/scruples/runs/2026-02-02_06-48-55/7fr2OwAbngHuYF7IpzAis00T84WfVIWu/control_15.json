My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife after developing feelings for another woman. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author married his wife almost 20 years ago, but he wasn't fully committed initially because he was scared of being alone. Over time, he developed depression and sought therapy. Now, he's feeling trapped in the marriage, especially when his wife touches him. Recently, he's formed a friendship with an attractive woman and started seeing a spark in their relationship. This has made him realize he might not want to continue the marriage. However, he's pulling away from his wife, causing her distress. He's conflicted about whether he's wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a marriage, physical affection is important. If he's suddenly pulling away, that's going to hurt her. The wife says he's the best thing that happened to her, which suggests she values the relationship highly. The author is now emotionally distant and considering the possibility of ending the marriage because of his feelings for someone else. \n\nBut wait, he mentions he's not looking to end the marriage over a \"passing crush.\" However, forming a close bond with another woman while married can lead to infidelity or emotional cheating, which is generally considered wrong. Even if he's not physically cheating, the emotional connection might be a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's depression and past issues might contribute to his current feelings. Therapy helped him become more aware of his emotions, which led to this change. But is it fair to his wife to suddenly withdraw affection without more communication or effort to work through the issues? The wife is devastated and seeking answers, which indicates she's in emotional pain. \n\nMarriages require work from both partners. If the author is feeling trapped for years and now sees a new possibility, is it his fault for wanting something better? Or is he being selfish by not considering his wife's feelings and the children? The children aren't mentioned in the conflict, but they're part of the equation. \n\nThe key factors here are communication, emotional infidelity, and mutual effort in the marriage. The author hasn't communicated his long-standing issues to his wife, leading to a sudden withdrawal. The new relationship with the woman might be a catalyst, but it's also a sign that he's seeking emotional fulfillment elsewhere. \n\nIn many cultures and ethical frameworks, staying in a marriage with emotional distance and then acting on feelings for someone else is seen as a breach of the marital commitment. However, if the marriage was already unhappy and the author is now seeking to address the issues, there's a counterargument that he's taking the right step. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is emotionally involved with another woman while married, that's typically considered cheating. Even if he's not physically, the emotional aspect can still be problematic. Also, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without addressing the root issues with his wife\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the marriage was based on fear and lack of genuine connection, maybe the author is realizing he's unhappy and needs to make a change. But the method of change (withdrawing affection and forming an emotional bond with another woman) might be the wrong approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's emotionally cheating and not addressing the underlying issues with his wife. He should have communicated his feelings earlier and perhaps sought couples' therapy instead of turning to another relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
