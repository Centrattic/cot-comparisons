My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong in not wanting to touch their wife after finding someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is married for almost 20 years, has two kids, and initially married out of fear of being alone. They weren't entirely committed but tried to make it work. Over time, they developed depression and started therapy. Now, they feel trapped and disconnected from their wife, especially when she touches them. They've developed feelings for another woman, which has made them more open to ending the marriage. Their wife is hurt and confused because their behavior changed suddenly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the long-term marriage, emotional issues, and the recent shift in their feelings leading to physical withdrawal from their spouse. The author is struggling between their current feelings and the fear of ending a 20-year marriage. \n\nNow, considering relationship ethics, communication is crucial. The author mentions they had suicidal thoughts but didn't tell their wife, which might show a lack of open communication. The sudden change in behavior without discussing it with their wife could be seen as hurtful. The wife feels devastated, which indicates that the author's actions are causing emotional pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in therapy and is exploring their emotions more. They might be in a healthier place now, realizing their marriage isn't fulfilling. But the way they're handling it\u2014pulling away without explanation\u2014might be contributing to the problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're not necessarily doing something illegal, but in terms of relationship responsibilities, being emotionally distant and withholding affection can be damaging. The fact that they had a connection with another woman might be influencing their actions, which raises questions about emotional commitment. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She sees him as the best thing in her life and is now dealing with rejection. The author's sudden change in behavior without prior communication is likely the main issue here. Even if their feelings for the other woman are genuine, the way they're handling the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards \"A\" (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their feelings properly and are causing emotional harm. However, there's also the argument that they're trying to be honest about their feelings now, albeit abruptly. But considering the impact on their wife and the lack of communication, \"A\" seems more justified.\n"
