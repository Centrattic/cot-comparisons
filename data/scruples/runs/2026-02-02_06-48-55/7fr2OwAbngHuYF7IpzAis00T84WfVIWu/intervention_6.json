My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been married almost 20 years but aren't emotionally connected, and they're pulling away from their wife physically. They mention a new friendship with an attractive woman that's giving them hope for a post-marriage life. The wife is hurt and confused, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband married out of fear of being alone and didn't have his heart in it. He later struggled with depression, which he addressed through therapy. Now he's feeling differently, doesn't want to be with his wife anymore, and is acting on that by pulling away. He's not having an affair but is forming a close friendship with someone else, which might be leading to infidelity. \n\nMarriage is a commitment. The husband is changing how he interacts with his wife suddenly, which is causing her distress. Even if he's unhappy, cutting off physical contact and emotional support without communication or seeking to resolve the issues might be inconsiderate. The wife feels devastated and is asking for understanding, but he's not providing it. \n\nHe mentions not wanting to end the marriage over a \"crush,\" but his actions are leading to that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to maintain the marriage and for causing his wife pain. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings now. On the other, he entered the marriage with reservations and is only now changing his behavior without addressing the long-term impact on his wife and kids. \n\nAlso, the new friendship with a woman could be a red flag. Even if there's no affair, the emotional connection might be a step towards one, which could be a betrayal of trust. The wife deserves to know the real reasons behind the change in behavior. His actions are causing her pain without clear communication, which could make him look inconsiderate.\n\nBut some might argue that he's finally being truthful about his feelings after years of being unhappy. However, honesty isn't a free pass if it's done without consideration for the spouse's feelings. The fact that he stayed in the marriage for 20 years despite not being emotionally committed could also be a point against him. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not communicating his feelings properly, is causing harm without addressing it, and is possibly leading towards infidelity. The wife deserves to know the truth and have a say in the future of the marriage, rather than being pushed away without explanation.\n"
