My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is a marriage that's been going on for almost 20 years. The man is almost 50, and he's been struggling with his feelings towards his wife for a while. He mentions that he married her out of fear of being alone, and his heart wasn't fully in it. Now, after years of feeling trapped and dealing with depression, he's started to pull away from his wife physically, which is causing her distress.\n\nHe's developed a connection with another woman, which has made him realize that maybe leaving the marriage could be a positive change. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting to touch his wife anymore and for changing his behavior suddenly.\n\nSo, considering the context, the man's feelings are a result of a long-term emotional struggle. He's been in a marriage that he wasn't emotionally invested in from the start, which led to a lack of emotional connection. His depression and the subsequent therapy helped him become more aware of his true feelings. The emergence of feelings for another woman isn't the root issue here; it's more about his dissatisfaction in the current marriage and his newfound ability to prioritize his own emotional well-being.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong for not wanting to be in a marriage where he feels trapped and unfulfilled? On one hand, he's been in the marriage for 20 years and has children. Ending it now could be seen as abandoning the family. But on the other hand, staying in a marriage that's causing him and possibly his wife emotional pain might not be healthy either. The key point is that he's not just suddenly deciding to leave because of the new woman but because he's finally confronting his long-standing issues.\n\nIs it wrong to not want to touch his wife? If there's a lack of mutual affection and he's experiencing genuine discomfort, then maybe it's not wrong. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away suddenly without addressing the underlying issues with his wife\u2014could be problematic. He mentions that his wife is devastated and is asking why he changed. He hasn't communicated his feelings clearly, which could be part of the problem. But considering his history of repression and the sudden shift due to the new relationship, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the wrongness is about causing his wife pain, then yes, but if it's about acting on his true feelings after a long period of unhappiness, then maybe not. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about marriage and commitment. In many perspectives, staying in an unhappy marriage isn't inherently wrong, but neither is seeking happiness if it's causing lasting harm. The author is trying to balance his own needs with the reality of a long-term commitment. Since the change in behavior is a result of his genuine realization and not just a fleeting infatuation, it's a matter of personal choice and right to seek fulfillment. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong, but he does need to handle the situation with care and communication.\n"
