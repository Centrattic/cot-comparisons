My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting to touch his wife after developing feelings for another woman.\n\nFirst, the user shares a personal story. He's been married 20 years, had two kids, but he admits he married his wife out of fear of being alone and wasn't fully committed. He later fell into depression, started therapy, and now he feels trapped in the marriage. Recently, he's developed feelings for a friend, which made him realize he doesn't want to stay in the marriage. Now, he's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nSo, the key points here: He's been unhappy in the marriage for a long time, maybe even from the start. He didn't communicate his feelings effectively until now. His wife is devastated because he's suddenly changed, but he's been struggling internally for years. The new woman isn't mentioned as cheating, just a growing friendship. The author feels trapped and is now being honest about his feelings.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, marriage requires both partners to be satisfied. If he's been unhappy and not communicating, maybe he's part of the problem. But he also sought therapy, which is a step toward addressing his emotions. However, suddenly pulling away and causing emotional harm is difficult. The question is about his responsibility here. \n\nHe's not doing anything illegal, but emotionally, he's causing pain. However, staying in a marriage without emotional connection can also be harmful. The problem is that he's only now being honest, and not addressing it earlier might have been part of the issue. But the fact that he's now being honest, even if it's causing conflict, could be seen as a positive step toward his own well-being and honesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has been devoted, thinking he's the best thing for her. He's now causing her distress without a clear conversation. Maybe he should have addressed his feelings earlier rather than waiting until he found someone else. But the situation is complex. \n\nThe options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Given that he's been unhappy for years and is now being honest, even if it's painful, maybe it's not his fault. However, the way he's handling it could be better. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the marriage was already strained and he's now being truthful, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But some might argue he should have worked on the marriage more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's in the wrong for not maintaining the marriage he committed to. But given he was unhappy and didn't communicate, it's a tough call. I think the answer depends on whether you prioritize his emotional needs or her hurt feelings. Given the information, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's being honest and seeking to address his feelings, even if the timing is hard.\n"
