My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not wanting to touch their wife. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is married for 20 years, has two kids, and was in a marriage that started from both being lonely. He married her out of fear of being alone, and now he's struggling with feeling trapped. He had a depression and started therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife and has started pulling away. He's also developed feelings for a friend, which has changed his perspective on the marriage. He's trying to figure out if he's in the wrong for not wanting to return to the previous dynamic.\n\nThe key points here are: the marriage wasn't based on genuine connection from the start, he's been unhappy but managed to cope until therapy made him more aware. Now, he's honest about his feelings but doesn't want to end the marriage over a crush. He's conflicted between his current feelings and the stability of a long-term marriage. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, communication is crucial. He didn't communicate his feelings before, which might have contributed to the current situation. His wife is devastated because she values the marriage and sees him as the best thing in her life. On the other hand, the author is trying to honor his true feelings and not remain in a harmful situation. \n\nThe fact that he's been in therapy and is now acting on his genuine emotions suggests he's not just being impulsive. However, pulling away physically without explanation can be hurtful. But considering his past feelings of being trapped and the recent development of a potential connection with someone else, his actions might be a step towards seeking personal happiness. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own emotional well-being? In some contexts, yes, but in a relationship where one person is unhappy for years, it's complicated. The author isn't cheating, just setting boundaries. He's also not ending the marriage abruptly but is considering the future. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's being honest now, but perhaps he should have addressed the issues earlier rather than waiting until he found someone else. However, his actions are a result of long-standing dissatisfaction. The decision isn't simple, but he's not necessarily wrong for seeking a way out if the marriage isn't fulfilling for him.\n"
