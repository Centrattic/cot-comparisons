My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term marriage where the husband is struggling with emotional distance and a new attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband has been married almost 20 years, had kids, and now feels trapped and unfulfilled. He went through depression and therapy, which helped him understand his emotions. Now he's not interested in physical contact with his wife, which upsets her. He's developed feelings for another woman, but he's conflicted about ending the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is emotional neglect and the new attraction. The husband has been avoiding intimacy, which is causing his wife distress. But he's also realizing that he doesn't want to stay in a marriage that makes him feel trapped. \n\nIs it his fault for not wanting to touch his wife? Well, if there's a lack of mutual emotional connection, maybe it's a problem with the marriage itself. He mentioned that when he was in therapy, he learned to cooperate with his emotions, which suggests that his feelings are genuine. But he hasn't communicated these feelings to his wife except by pulling away, which is hurting her. \n\nOn the other hand, developing feelings for someone else while married is typically seen as a breach of commitment. Even if the marriage is unhappy, acting on those feelings can be seen as infidelity. The husband is using the new attraction as a reason to consider ending the marriage, but he's not sure if it's a passing phase. \n\nHowever, the root problem seems to be the long-term dissatisfaction and lack of emotional support in the marriage. The husband's emotional needs weren't met, leading to his depression and current situation. He's now being honest about his feelings, which might be necessary for his well-being, but it's causing pain for his wife. \n\nIs he in the wrong for not wanting to stay in a marriage where he feels trapped? Maybe not entirely. But is he in the wrong for developing feelings for someone else? That's more complicated. He hasn't acted physically on the attraction, just emotionally. But the emotional infidelity could be a factor. \n\nThe wife says he's the best thing to ever happen to her, but he wasn't emotionally present. That's a key point. If the marriage was based on fear of being alone rather than genuine connection, maybe both parties contributed to the issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is in a difficult situation. He's trying to be honest about his feelings, but the way he's handling it (pulling away without communication) is hurting his wife. However, the underlying issues in the marriage might mean he's not entirely responsible. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). The key is whether his actions are unjustified. His emotional needs not being met is part of the problem, but the fact that he's now pushing away his wife without clear communication might be inconsiderate. However, he's trying to be honest about his feelings, which could be necessary. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but the question is a binary choice. Since he's in therapy and working through his emotions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the sudden change without communication is an issue. Alternatively, if the marriage was unhappy and he's trying to find his own happiness, he's not in the wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's struggling with genuine emotional issues and is trying to be honest about his feelings, even though it's causing conflict. The problem lies in the marriage's lack of emotional fulfillment, not necessarily his fault for wanting to leave it.\n"
