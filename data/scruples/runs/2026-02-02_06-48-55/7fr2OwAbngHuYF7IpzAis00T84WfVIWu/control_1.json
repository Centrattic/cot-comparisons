My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a man married for almost 20 years. He married his wife because he was lonely and afraid of being alone. He wasn't really in love but felt trapped. Now, he's dealing with depression and therapy has helped him understand his emotions better. He's been feeling disconnected from his wife, especially when she touches him, leading to a sense of emptiness and being trapped. Recently, he's developed feelings for a female friend, which has made him consider the idea of ending his marriage. He's started pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress. He's conflicted between staying in a marriage he doesn't want to end over a crush versus not wanting to return to a situation he finds painful.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the marriage was entered into under pressure due to loneliness and fear of being alone. The author didn't have his heart in the marriage from the start. Over time, he developed depression and sought therapy, which helped him confront his feelings. Now, he's emotionally honest about not wanting to be with his wife, but he's also aware of the impact his actions are having on her. She's devastated and asking for an explanation, but he feels he can't go back to the previous state.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in his actions. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings, which he's worked through in therapy. On the other hand, his new interest in another woman might be seen as a catalyst for his withdrawal from the marriage. However, the root of his discomfort with his wife predates the new relationship. The emotional distance and aversion to physical touch have been ongoing, and the new friendship is more of a trigger that made him realize his feelings might not be temporary.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and communication. The author hasn't been honest about his true feelings for years, which could be considered neglectful. By suddenly pulling away, he's causing emotional harm, but he's also acknowledging that the marriage wasn't working for him. The question is whether it's fair to expect him to stay in a marriage where he's unhappy, especially after realizing the emotional toll it's taking on him.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the new relationship. If the author is developing feelings for someone else, that could be seen as a breach of marital fidelity, even if it's not a physical affair yet. But the primary issue here is the emotional withdrawal and the impact on his wife. The author is being honest now, which is a step towards addressing the marriage's problems, but the method might be abrupt and unkind.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author's actions are a result of his emotional journey and therapy, which is positive. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without a plan or support for his wife\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The key question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to continue a marriage that he feels is causing him emotional pain, even if it's causing his wife pain now.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, mutual consent and effort are necessary in a marriage. If one person can no longer contribute to the relationship, it's not necessarily their fault they can't continue. But the manner in which they exit is important. The author hasn't been dishonest about his feelings for years, which could be a point against him. But he's now seeking to be honest, which is a positive step.\n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? If the marriage is already emotionally broken and one person is fundamentally unhappy, it's not necessarily wrong to seek a way out. However, doing so abruptly without support for the other person might be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily wrong. The author is not committing an act that's clearly unethical, given the long-term issues. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
