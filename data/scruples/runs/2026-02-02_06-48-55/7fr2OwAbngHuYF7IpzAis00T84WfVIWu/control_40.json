My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment call on the person's actions. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is a man in a 20-year marriage, who's been struggling with feeling trapped and depression. He didn't have a strong emotional connection with his wife from the start, and now he's developed feelings for a female friend. He's pulling away from his wife physically, which is causing her distress. He's conflicted between wanting to end the marriage but also not wanting to ruin it over a \"crush.\"\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author has a history of being in the marriage out of fear of being alone, which suggests the relationship might not have been entirely healthy from the beginning. He sought therapy, which is good, but now he's acting on new feelings. However, he's not cheating; he's just emotionally distant and not responding to his wife's affection. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong by pulling away. His wife is clearly hurt and confused. The author's actions are causing her emotional pain, but he's also trying to be honest about his feelings. Is it fair to expect him to continue a marriage that makes him feel trapped, even if it's stable? On the other hand, his sudden change in behavior without communication (other than saying he doesn't want to go back) might be abrupt for his wife.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that he's been feeling hollow for a long time and that the change is because he's no longer hiding his feelings. The therapist helped him be honest with himself. So maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to end a marriage that's not fulfilling. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away and not communicating properly\u2014might be problematic. He needs to have a serious conversation instead of just pushing her away.\n\nAlso, there are children involved. The impact on them should be considered. The author is in a tough spot between two unhappy options. But is he in the wrong for not wanting to stay in an unhappy marriage? Or is he in the wrong for not handling the transition better?\n\nThe key here is that the author is not cheating but is emotionally withdrawing. While his reasons are personal and rooted in long-term dissatisfaction, he's causing his wife emotional harm by not being open and honest from the start. He should have addressed the issues before they escalated to this point. However, his decision to seek therapy and be honest, even if it's difficult, might not be entirely his fault. The question is whether his actions (pulling away) are wrong despite his reasons.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, staying in a marriage for the kids or out of fear might be expected, but if the marriage is harmful, leaving could be seen as the right choice. However, the suddenness and lack of communication could make him partly at fault. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's causing harm without prior communication, but maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's seeking to address his true feelings. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the fact that he's acting on newfound honesty and not being dishonest about his feelings might tip it towards B. However, the way he's handling the situation is poor, so maybe A. Hmm.\n"
