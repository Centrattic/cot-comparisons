My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a man in a 20-year marriage, feeling disconnected from his wife. He mentions that they married out of loneliness and fear of being alone. He had a depression and suicidal thoughts, sought therapy, and now is more in touch with his emotions. Recently, he's developed feelings for a friend, which made him realize he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore. Now, he's pulling away from her physically, causing her distress. He's conflicted between wanting to leave the marriage and fearing the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Is it wrong to prioritize your own well-being over a long-term commitment? The author is not cheating; he's just emotionally distancing. However, the wife feels betrayed and is upset. Communication is a big part here. The author didn't talk to his wife about his feelings but instead acted on them, which might be seen as unfair.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to his own happiness and emotional health. He's been suffering in the marriage for years. On the other hand, the marriage has been long-term, and sudden withdrawal without discussion could be hurtful. The wife might feel abandoned, especially since she considers him the best thing in her life. The author's actions could be seen as breaking trust and not respecting the commitment.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that he tried to \"make it work\" out of fear of being alone, which might indicate the marriage wasn't fulfilling for him either. The key point is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to continue the marriage. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without open communication\u2014could be problematic. Maybe he should have talked to his wife first instead of pushing her away, leading to her devastation.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of emotional infidelity. He's forming a close bond with another woman, which might be considered inappropriate, even if there's no physical affair. This could be seen as a breach of marital trust.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the author's own needs versus his wife's feelings, lack of communication, emotional involvement with another person, and the sudden change in behavior. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because he's not approaching the situation with transparency and empathy. He needs to have an honest conversation with his wife rather than withdrawing, which causes her pain. However, he's also not at fault for realizing he doesn't want to continue the marriage\u2014it's the method of handling it that's questionable.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions in pulling away without communication make him at fault. In many ethical frameworks, communication and mutual respect are key. So, yes, he's in the wrong for not handling the situation better, even if the root feelings are valid.\n"
