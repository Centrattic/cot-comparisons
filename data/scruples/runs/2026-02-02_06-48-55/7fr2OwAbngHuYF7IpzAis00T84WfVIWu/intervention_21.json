My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband in a 20-year marriage who's been struggling with not wanting to be touched by his wife. He mentions that they got married because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He didn't feel fully committed at the time but went through with it. Over the years, he had a depression and suicidal thoughts, which he's been working on in therapy. Now, he's started to feel more connected to a female friend who's about 40, and this has made him realize that maybe ending the marriage could be a happy option. As a result, he's been pulling away from his wife's touch, causing her distress. He's torn between not wanting to return to his previous state and not wanting to end the marriage over a crush.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband has been unhappy in the marriage for a long time but has been hiding his feelings. Now, a new connection has made him consider leaving. The issue is his sudden withdrawal from physical contact with his wife, which is hurting her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom one side, he's dealing with emotional issues and therapy has helped him recognize his feelings. He's not in a healthy place in the marriage and the new relationship (or at least the attraction) is a factor in his realization. But on the other hand, he's been in a long-term marriage with children, and his sudden rejection of physical touch is causing his wife pain. She's described as someone who values the marriage and sees him as her best thing. He's been emotionally distant, and now his actions are making her question the stability of their relationship.\n\nMarriage requires mutual respect and communication. If he's been feeling trapped and unhappy for years but only now is acting on it, perhaps he has a duty to communicate his needs earlier. However, it's also possible that he didn't realize the depth of his issues until therapy. The depression and emotional struggles might have contributed to his inability to express his feelings in the past.\n\nThe wife is clearly upset by his withdrawal. Physical touch is a key part of intimacy in a marriage. If he no longer wants that, it's a significant change that affects the relationship. But is he in the wrong for not wanting to be in a marriage that he's found unfulfilling? Or is he in the wrong for not addressing his feelings sooner and causing his wife distress now?\n\nAlso, the presence of a new attraction might be complicating things. Is the husband being honest about his feelings, or is the new connection influencing his decision to distance from his wife? The line between self-awareness and acting on a new relationship could be blurred. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the current behavior, not whether the new attraction is appropriate (though that's a separate concern).\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, a spouse has a duty to maintain the relationship and address issues. If the husband had communicated his needs earlier, maybe the situation could have been handled differently. But given his history of depression and emotional struggles, maybe he's only now reaching a point where he can be honest. However, his sudden change is causing distress now.\n\nAnother angle: if he's not in love with his wife and no longer wants the marriage to continue, is it fair to stay in it while being emotionally distant and causing her pain? Or is it better to be honest and seek separation, even though that's difficult?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFactors to consider: length of marriage, presence of children, emotional struggles, recent emotional awakening, impact on wife, communication issues. The author hasn't been honest about his feelings until now, leading to sudden withdrawal. The wife is hurt and seeking answers. The author is considering whether to end the marriage but is also unsure if the change is temporary.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is not in the wrong because he's being honest now, even if it's painful. In others, he should have addressed the issues earlier and is now being abrupt. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values around marriage and communication.\n\nI think the key is whether he's being dishonest or is finally being truthful. If he's been hiding his feelings for years and now is being honest, even if it's causing pain, that's a natural part of self-realization. However, the way he's handling it (pulling away without clear communication) could be considered inconsiderate. The wife might need more transparency and support rather than rejection.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's acting on his own emotional needs, which he's only now understanding, it's a complex situation. However, the fact that he's causing his wife distress without prior communication could mean he's in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's not in a place to continue the marriage, maybe it's better to be honest even if it's difficult.\n\nI'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's been in a long-term marriage and his sudden change without addressing the root issues over the years might be harsh on his wife. However, if his emotional needs are genuine and he's struggling with his mental health, it's a complex case. Given the information, the author might not be in the wrong because he's finally being honest about his feelings, even if it's painful. But the way he's handling it could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and depending on the perspective, it's a tough call. The answer could be either, but I need to choose A or B based on the reasoning.\n"
