My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they're married for 20 years, went into it because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. The author didn't have their heart in it and felt trapped. Then they had a depression, got therapy, and now they don't like being touched by their wife. But they found a new friend who's a woman in their group, and they're starting to feel something for her. Now when the wife wants physical contact, the author pulls away or says no, which is causing her distress.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they are. Let me break it down. The author is struggling with their marriage, feeling trapped, and found a new emotional connection. They're not hiding their feelings anymore, which upsets the wife. On one hand, the author is dealing with their own mental health, depression, and therapy helped them become more aware of their emotions. They might be realizing that the marriage isn't fulfilling for them, which is a valid reason to consider leaving. But on the other hand, they're pulling away from their wife without addressing the situation more openly or maybe not giving enough consideration to her feelings.\n\nThe wife says he's the best thing that ever happened to her, indicating she values the relationship deeply. The author's sudden change in behavior is causing her devastation. The key here is communication. The author might be in the wrong if they're not being honest about their feelings and the reasons behind their withdrawal. They mention they don't want to end the marriage over a passing crush, but they also feel a change that's not temporary. The author is in a tough spot between their emotional needs and their commitment to the marriage.\n\nHowever, the author is dealing with long-standing issues in the marriage, feelings of being trapped, and now a new connection. It's possible that their actions are a result of their own healing process, but they need to handle it with care. The question is whether their current behavior (pulling away from physical contact) is justified given their internal struggles. If the author isn't communicating properly or being considerate of the wife's feelings, then they might be in the wrong. But if they're finally being honest about their feelings after years of pretending, maybe not. The answer might depend on whether there's an effort to address the marriage's issues constructively rather than just pulling away.\n"
