My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is married for 20 years and has been feeling trapped and unfulfilled for a long time. They went through depression and therapy, which helped them understand their emotions better. Now, they have feelings for another woman and are pulling away from their wife physically. The wife is hurt and confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their marriage. The author mentions marrying out of fear of being alone and not having their heart in it. That's a red flag for a lack of emotional connection from the start. Over time, the marriage led to depression, which suggests there were deeper issues. Therapy helped them realize they don't want to be with their wife anymore. \n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch their wife. The author's feelings have changed, and they're being honest about their emotions. However, they're also causing pain to their wife by pulling away. The wife feels devastated because she sees the sudden change, but the author has been struggling for years. \n\nThe author hasn't acted on the feelings yet; they're just not reciprocating physical affection. That's a form of emotional withdrawal. In a marriage, both partners need to feel connected. If one partner can't provide that, it's a problem. But the author is finally being honest about their feelings instead of silently enduring a harmful situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using the new friendship as a catalyst for change, which might indicate that they're making the decision to leave the marriage because of a new relationship. That could be seen as using the crush as an excuse to end the marriage rather than addressing the existing issues. However, the author mentions that the feelings for the other woman have made them realize that ending the marriage could be a possibility they hadn't considered before. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author isn't just being cold; they've been through therapy and are trying to be honest about their feelings. They don't want to be in the marriage anymore, even though they care about their wife and the kids. They're in a tough spot between wanting to be honest and not wanting to destroy a 20-year relationship over a temporary crush. But the author believes it's not temporary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual consent and emotional investment. If one partner has been unhappy for years and is now choosing to be honest, even if it's painful, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they're handling it could be problematic if they're not communicating adequately or being transparent with their spouse. The author is trying to be honest but might not be giving their wife enough consideration in the process.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because they're finally being truthful about their feelings after years of unhappiness. They're not acting on the infidelity yet but are making their boundaries clear. The wife, on the other hand, might need to address the emotional disconnect that's been present for years. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
