My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a 50-year-old man married for 20 years who's struggling with his feelings towards his wife. He initially married her out of fear of being alone, and now he's pulling away because he feels trapped. He's developed feelings for another woman and is no longer avoiding his emotions, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is married and has developed a crush on another woman. He's physically pulling away from his wife, which is causing her distress. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this.\n\nOn one hand, he's dealing with long-term issues in the marriage, possibly depression, and seeking therapy. His withdrawal might be a result of his own emotional struggles. He's not acting on the crush, just engaging in friendship. But he's not being honest with his wife, which could be harmful. He's also causing her emotional pain by rejecting her affection.\n\nOn the other hand, he's in therapy and trying to address his feelings. He's not cheating, but the sudden change in behavior is hurting his wife. The key points are honesty and communication. He hasn't told his wife about his feelings or the reasons behind his withdrawal. That lack of communication is problematic. Also, developing feelings for another woman while married raises ethical questions about commitment and fidelity. Even if he's not cheating, the emotional connection could undermine the marriage.\n\nThe author's actions are leading to marital distress. By not being open with his wife, he's not giving her a chance to work through things together. The fact that he's considering the possibility of ending the marriage shows he's aware of the implications, but his actions are still causing harm. Even if his feelings for the other woman are genuine, acting on them or even fostering the relationship could be seen as disloyal. However, since he's not cheating yet, it's more about emotional distance and lack of communication.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, maintaining honesty and commitment in a marriage is crucial. The author's behavior, while maybe stemming from his own needs, isn't respecting his wife's needs and is causing her harm. So, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent and for emotionally withdrawing without addressing the root issues with his wife. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the impact on his wife, even if his intentions are to seek personal happiness.\n"
