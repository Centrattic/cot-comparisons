My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who's been married almost 20 years, feeling trapped and having negative feelings towards physical contact with his wife. He mentions depression and therapy, which helped him understand his emotions. Recently, he's developed feelings for a friend, which made him reconsider his marriage. Now, he's pulling away from his wife, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects. Marital relationships require mutual respect and communication. The man admits he's been feeling this way for a long time but only started acting on it after the new friendship. Withholding physical affection is a significant change that affects his wife deeply. Even though he's going through personal struggles, his actions have emotional consequences for his wife. \n\nHe mentions not wanting to end the marriage over a \"passing crush\" but also that the change isn't temporary. This suggests he's contemplating leaving, which would add to the hurt. The key here is whether he's being honest with his wife. If he's been struggling with these feelings for years but only recently acted on them without open communication, that's problematic. \n\nHowever, he's also seeking therapy, which is a positive step. The fact that he's aware of his emotions and trying to process them could mitigate some blame. But the sudden withdrawal of affection without explanation is hurtful. The wife feels devastated and is asking for reasons, which he's not providing. Ethically, he should be honest and communicate his needs, even if it's difficult. \n\nOn the other hand, if the marriage was already emotionally distant and filled with unresolved issues, there's a case for his perspective. Still, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without discussion\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer hinges on whether his actions (withholding affection) are justifiable given the circumstances. \n\nGiven that he's in therapy and processing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong entirely. But the lack of communication with his wife is a problem. The question is whether he's responsible for being honest and addressing the issues, rather than just pulling away. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the impact on his wife and lack of communication, even if his feelings are valid.\n"
