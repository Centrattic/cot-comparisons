My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: He's been married almost 20 years, but he doesn't feel connected emotionally or physically to his wife anymore. He's been in a depression, and after therapy, he's trying to be honest with his feelings. Now, he's been avoiding physical touch with his wife because it makes him feel trapped. He's also developing feelings for another woman, which made him realize that maybe leaving the marriage could be a better option. His wife is upset because he's pulling away suddenly.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's seeking therapy and trying to be honest with himself and his wife. He's not having an affair yet, just forming a friendship with an attractive woman. But he's avoiding his wife's touch and not communicating well, leading his wife to feel devastated. \n\nMarriage requires mutual effort and communication. If he's been feeling unfulfilled for years but only now is acting on it, maybe he should have addressed the issues earlier. However, he did try to make it work through therapy. The sudden withdrawal of affection is causing harm now. \n\nHe doesn't want to end the marriage over a crush, but he's not hiding his feelings anymore. The problem is that he's not communicating effectively with his wife. If he's considering leaving, he should talk to her about it instead of just pulling away. \n\nHe might be in the wrong for not addressing the issues earlier and for not being open about his feelings. But his feelings are real, and he's trying to be honest now. It's a tough spot. Maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong for feeling how he does, but he's wrong for not managing the situation better. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to pick one. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often considers communication and actions. He's not cheating, but he's emotionally withdrawing and not being transparent with his wife. That could be seen as wrong. However, he's also dealing with depression and trying to be honest. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's seeking help and trying to be authentic, even if it's hard on his wife. The main issue is the lack of communication. So, depending on perspective, maybe B is better.\n"
