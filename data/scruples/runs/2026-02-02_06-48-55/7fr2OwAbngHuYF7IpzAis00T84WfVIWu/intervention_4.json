My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for my analysis based on the situation provided.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in a 20-year marriage who's had a long-standing issue with physical touch from his wife. He mentions feeling trapped and hollow, and that he married her out of fear of being alone. Then he went into depression and therapy. Now, after developing feelings for another woman, he's pulling away from his wife physically, which is causing her distress. The main question is whether he's at fault for not wanting to touch his wife anymore and acting on his feelings towards another woman.\n\nHmm. In a marriage, both partners have needs. The author's physical discomfort with his wife is significant. If his feelings for the other woman are genuine, that adds another layer. But is it wrong to not want to be with his wife anymore? Well, marriages can be difficult, and sometimes they end. However, acting on a new relationship while married could be seen as a betrayal. But the author hasn't actually ended the marriage yet; he's just changing his behavior. He's pulling away from his wife, which is causing her pain. \n\nHe's been in therapy, which is good, and he's trying to understand his emotions. But does that justify his current behavior? His wife is hurting and feels abandoned. The author might be acting out of his own needs, but not considering her feelings. Also, the fact that he's been avoiding physical touch for a while but now is more open about it might make it seem more abrupt to her. \n\nOn the other hand, he's been unhappy for a long time. Maybe the marriage isn't fulfilling for him, and he's trying to be honest. But honesty doesn't excuse causing pain without communication. Did he have a conversation with his wife about his feelings before pulling away? The narrative doesn't mention that. He says he's not sure if it's a passing phase, but the change is sudden for her. \n\nSo, if he's considering leaving the marriage, he needs to approach it responsibly, not just pull away and expect her to handle it. The fact that he's developing a relationship with another woman while still married complicates things. Even if he's contemplating divorce, starting an affair would be wrong. But the text says he's met her a few times and chats online, which might be the beginnings of an affair. That could be a problem. \n\nI think the key points here are the lack of communication, the emotional impact on his wife, and the potential infidelity. The author is causing his wife distress by changing his behavior abruptly without addressing the underlying issues in the marriage first. He also might be acting on his new feelings before fully understanding the consequences. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's not handling the situation with care towards his wife's feelings and might be engaging in infidelity while still married.\n"
