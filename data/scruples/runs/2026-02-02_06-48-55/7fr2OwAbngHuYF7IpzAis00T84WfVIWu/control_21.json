My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe man is married for almost 20 years, has two kids. He says he married his wife because he was lonely and afraid of being alone. He didn't really have a strong emotional connection at the start. Then he had depression, got therapy, and started understanding his feelings better. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife, which he's only recently started showing. He's been having feelings for a friend and this has made him consider ending the marriage. His wife is hurt and doesn't understand why he's pulling away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's feelings towards his wife have been negative for a while, but he's only now acting on them. He's been in therapy and is now more honest about his emotions. The new feelings for another woman might be influencing his decision to distance from his wife. However, he's not cheating, just not engaging physically with his wife.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, communication is a big part of any relationship. If he's been feeling this way for years but only recently started acting on it, maybe he didn't communicate his needs earlier. But he did seek therapy, which suggests he was trying to work on himself. However, his wife might feel betrayed or hurt by his sudden change. Also, the fact that he's developing a relationship with another woman could complicate things. Even if he's not cheating, the emotional attachment might be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the marriage was unhappy and he's finally being honest about his feelings, maybe it's better for both to consider whether the marriage should continue. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. Withholding physical affection can be a form of emotional neglect, especially if it's a significant change. However, if he's experiencing genuine emotional distance and discomfort, it's a complex situation.\n\nI need to think about the responsibilities in a marriage. Both partners have needs. If he's been struggling for years and only now is addressing it, perhaps he should have communicated earlier. But maybe he didn't know how to express it. Also, the presence of another person might be influencing his decision, which could be a red flag. However, it's not clear if there's an actual affair. The main issue is the physical rejection and the sudden change.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe he's not entirely wrong because he's seeking therapy and trying to be honest about his feelings. But he's also causing his wife pain by pulling away without prior communication. So perhaps there's a balance. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on marriage, but since the question is about being in the wrong, I need to assess if his actions are justified.\n\nI think the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's acting on his genuine feelings and seeking to address his emotional needs after years of suppressing them. However, there's a responsibility to communicate better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the marriage was already unhappy and he's now being honest, maybe not. However, the sudden change without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is B, but with the note that communication could have been better. But according to the options, it's A or B. Since the user wants just A or B, I'll go with B because the core issue is his emotional state and seeking authenticity, even if communication could have been improved.\n"
