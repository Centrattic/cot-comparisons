My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who's been married for 20 years and is now avoiding physical contact with his wife. He mentions feeling trapped and having depression, which he's been working on in therapy. Recently, he's developed feelings for another woman and has changed his behavior towards his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is avoiding touching his wife, which is causing her distress. He's been in therapy, dealing with past issues, and now there's a new emotional connection with another woman. The question is whether he's in the wrong for changing his behavior.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and communication. If he's been struggling with feelings of emptiness and now has a change of heart, he needs to address this with his wife. However, abruptly withdrawing physical affection without clear communication can be hurtful. The wife values the marriage and sees him as the best thing in her life. His actions might be seen as neglectful or dismissive of her feelings, especially if he hasn't been honest about his emotional state for a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has been dealing with depression and emotional issues that he's only recently started to address. His change in behavior might stem from a genuine realization of his feelings, not just a passing phase. But the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without thorough communication\u2014could be problematic. He's also considering the impact on their 20-year marriage and the kids, which shows some level of responsibility.\n\nThe ethical side: Is it wrong to prioritize his own well-being over the marriage? Or is it wrong to cause his wife emotional pain without addressing it? The answer likely hinges on communication and effort to resolve the issues before making drastic changes. Since he's been avoiding his feelings for years and now acting on them suddenly, it might be seen as a breach of trust or responsibility. However, if the marriage was already unsatisfying and he's seeking a more fulfilling life, there's an argument there too.\n\nBut in most relationships, open communication is key. If he hasn't discussed his long-standing issues with his wife, that's a problem. Now, acting on a new relationship without her knowledge (even if it's just a crush) could be seen as dishonest. The fact that he's avoiding physical contact is causing her distress, which he might be neglecting in his focus on his own needs.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because he hasn't communicated his feelings properly, leading to sudden withdrawal and emotional harm to his wife. Marriage requires effort from both sides, and his actions without prior discussion could be seen as selfish.\n"
