My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term marriage where the husband has been feeling disconnected for years, has depression, and now is forming a friendship with another woman that's leading him to not want to be touched by his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband has been married almost 20 years, had depression, and was in therapy. He's been avoiding physical touch with his wife because it makes him feel trapped and hollow. Recently, he's developed feelings for another woman, which has given him a new perspective, making him consider ending the marriage. His wife is upset because he's pulling away physically.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a marriage, both partners have the right to feel emotionally and physically connected. If one person is consistently unhappy or disengaging, that can be problematic. The husband's avoidance of touch and emotional withdrawal might be hurting his wife. On the other hand, he's going through personal growth and realizing his feelings aren't what they used to be. He's not cheating but is forming a friendship that's causing tension.\n\nMarriage requires communication and mutual respect. If he's changed because he's been in therapy and is now more honest about his feelings, maybe he's right to prioritize his own well-being. But he also needs to consider his wife's needs and their long-term commitment. However, if the marriage has been unsatisfying for years and he's found someone who makes him happy, is he wrong to pursue that? It's complicated. But the key here is that he hasn't acted on the feelings yet\u2014just forming a friendship. But pulling away from his wife is causing her distress. \n\nThe wife's feelings are important too. She's been devoted for 20 years and now faces rejection. But the husband's mental health is also a factor. Is he in the wrong for not wanting to be in a marriage that's making him unhappy, or is he in the wrong for not trying to fix it? The answer might depend on whether he's being honest from the start or if he's been dishonest for years and now is abruptly changing. Since he's been struggling for a long time and is now being honest, maybe he's not in the wrong. But he should communicate better with his wife instead of just pulling away.\n"
