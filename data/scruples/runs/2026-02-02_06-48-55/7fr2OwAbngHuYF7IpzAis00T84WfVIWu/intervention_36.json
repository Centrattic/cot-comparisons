My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a man in a 20-year marriage who's been feeling disconnected for a long time. He's been avoiding physical touch with his wife, which is causing her distress. He's found some emotional connection with a friend, and now he's pulling away from his wife, not because of something temporary but because he's finally being honest about his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he married her because he was afraid of being alone, and his heart wasn't fully in it. Over time, he developed depression and didn't seek help until later. Now, he's realizing he doesn't want to be with his wife and is acting on that by avoiding physical intimacy. His wife is hurt and confused because the change is sudden.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, long-term marriages require effort from both parties. If the author felt disconnected for years but only started acting on it after meeting someone else, that might be a red flag. His wife has been depending on him emotionally and physically, and his withdrawal is causing her pain. The fact that he's now considering ending the marriage because of a new connection could be seen as using this new relationship as a justification for a decision he's been contemplating for a while.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that his wife says he's the best thing that happened to her. This indicates that she values the relationship, and his sudden withdrawal without addressing the underlying issues might be hurting her more. The author's actions could be seen as abandoning the relationship instead of working through the issues, especially since he was the one who initiated the marriage out of fear rather than love.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is finally being honest about his feelings. He's been struggling with emptiness and depression for years, and now he's taking steps to address it. If he's unhappy and his marriage is causing him distress, maybe it's fair for him to seek a way out. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without communication and potentially involving another woman\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author should have addressed his feelings and the issues in the marriage long before they escalated to this point. His sudden change in behavior without discussing the deeper problems might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since his wife is now suffering from his withdrawal. The fact that he's found a new connection might be a catalyst, but if the marriage was already in trouble, he should have communicated that earlier.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are causing harm to his wife. While he's being honest about his feelings, the method and timing could be problematic. Ending a long-term marriage isn't a decision to be taken lightly, and if he's only now deciding to be honest after years of suppression, it could be seen as a betrayal of the trust and commitment they once shared. The fact that he's using a new relationship as a way to justify the end of his marriage might also be a factor in determining whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's withdrawing from his wife without proper communication and potentially using a new relationship as an escape, which can be seen as a breach of trust and emotional abandonment.\n"
