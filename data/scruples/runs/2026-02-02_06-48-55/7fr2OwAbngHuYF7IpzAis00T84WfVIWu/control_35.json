My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is a man who's been married almost 20 years, and he's not feeling connected anymore. He had depression, went to therapy, and now he's starting to pull away from his wife physically when she wants to touch him. His wife is hurt and confused, but he feels trapped in the marriage and maybe sees a future with someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author says they married out of fear of being alone, and he wasn't fully committed at the start. That might mean the foundation wasn't strong. Then he had depression, which is a serious issue. The fact that he sought therapy and started to understand his emotions better is important. Now, he's realizing he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore, especially since he's connecting with another woman. \n\nBut wait, he's not having an affair yet. He's just developing feelings for a friend. The problem is that his wife is upset when he stops being affectionate. The key here is communication. If he's been hiding his feelings for a long time and now suddenly changes, that could be hurtful. However, if he's been unhappy for years and the marriage was already strained, maybe the problem is deeper. \n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. Is it fair to pull away from your spouse suddenly? On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings now. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed the issues in the marriage earlier instead of letting them fester. Also, considering his wife's perspective, she thinks he's the best thing that happened to her and is now confused and hurt. If he's moving towards ending the marriage, he needs to handle it with care, not just pulling away without communication. \n\nBut he mentions he's afraid of the marriage ending and has been trapped. So there's a history of emotional struggle. The therapist helped him realize his feelings. Maybe it's not just a passing phase. However, he also says he doesn't want to end the marriage over a crush. The conflict here is between his need for honesty and the impact on his wife. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require effort from both sides. If the marriage was unhappy for years and there's no mutual effort to fix it, maybe the blame isn't solely on him. But the way he's handling the current situation\u2014pulling away without explanation\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. He should communicate his reasons to his wife, even if it's hard. So, is he in the wrong for not wanting to touch her? If he's being honest about his feelings and they've been distant for a while, maybe not. But the sudden change and lack of communication might make it seem like he is. \n\nI think the answer hinges on communication and the history of the marriage. If he's been unhappy for years and the marriage was struggling, then it's a complex situation. However, the way he's handling the current dynamics\u2014without discussing his feelings openly\u2014could be problematic. So there's a mix of factors. But the user is asking for a binary answer, A or B. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's finally being honest about his feelings after years of suppressing them. But he needs to communicate better. However, if the question is about whether he's in the wrong for pulling away without explanation, maybe part of him is. But given the context, the answer leans toward B because his actions are part of a long-term issue and his need for self-truth.\n"
