My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has been married for 20 years and has been feeling trapped and disconnected. They went through depression and therapy, and now they're not wanting to be touched by their wife anymore. They met someone else and are considering ending the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they married out of fear of being alone and that their heart wasn't into it. Over time, they developed depression and didn't seek help until much later. Now, they're physically avoiding their wife's touch because it makes them feel trapped. They found a new friend who's attractive, and this has given them a sense of hope for a post-marriage life, leading them to pull away from their wife.\n\nThe wife is hurt and trying to understand the sudden change. The author is conflicted but feels like they can't go back to how things were. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be touched anymore and for distancing themselves from their wife.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author didn't address their feelings earlier, leading to years of unhappiness. Now, pulling away suddenly without clear communication could be hurtful. The wife feels devastated, which is understandable. The author's actions might be a result of their own emotional journey, but relationships require mutual effort. By not engaging in communication to resolve issues, the author is contributing to the breakdown. Also, there's a new person involved, which complicates things. The author might be using her as a reason to end the marriage rather than working on the existing relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to seek happiness and might not feel they can continue as before. However, cutting off physical contact abruptly without explanation (beyond what's already mentioned) can be seen as emotionally cruel. The author is in therapy, which is positive, but maybe they should involve the wife in the process. The decision to pull away might not be fair to the wife who's still invested and loving.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotional struggles and seeking a way out of an unhappy marriage. However, the way they're approaching it\u2014without open, honest communication with their wife and by forming a new relationship\u2014could be problematic. But the core issue is the lack of engagement in the marriage for years. The author is responsible for their part in the marriage's deterioration and how they handle the current situation. Therefore, while their feelings are valid, their actions might be contributing to the wife's pain, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
