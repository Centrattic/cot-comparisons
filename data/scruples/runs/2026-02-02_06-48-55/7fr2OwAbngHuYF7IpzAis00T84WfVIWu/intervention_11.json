My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's married for almost 20 years, is now avoiding physical contact with his wife because he doesn't feel connected anymore. But he's also developed feelings for another woman. He's struggling with whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife and considering the possibility of ending the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author mentions that he married his wife partly out of fear of being alone, and he wasn't fully committed at the beginning. Now, after years of marriage and having kids, he's experiencing depression and has started therapy. The therapy helped him understand his emotions better, leading him to realize he doesn't want to be physically close to his wife anymore. \n\nHe's now avoiding touch, which is causing his wife distress. She feels devastated and wants to know why he's changed. The author is conflicted between wanting to be honest about his feelings and not wanting to destroy a 20-year marriage over what he calls a \"passing crush.\"\n\nThe key points here are about consent, communication, and the nature of committed relationships. In a marriage, both partners have the right to emotional and physical connection. If the author is avoiding touch, that's a significant issue because it affects the wife's emotional well-being. She might feel rejected or unloved, especially given she considers him the best thing in her life. \n\nHowever, the author's situation is complex. He's dealing with personal issues like depression and past regrets about the marriage. His feelings for another woman might be a catalyst for his realization that he's not happy in the marriage. But he's not acting on those feelings physically\u2014he's just avoiding his wife. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to maintain the physical aspects of the marriage, or if the issue is deeper.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the marriage is unhappy and there's a lack of mutual satisfaction, the fault isn't entirely on one person. The author married someone he wasn't fully committed to, which is his choice. Now, he's choosing to be honest about his current feelings, which could be seen as necessary for his well-being. However, the way he's handling it\u2014by pulling away without open communication\u2014could be hurtful. The wife might feel that he's abandoning the relationship without addressing the core issues that led to his disconnection.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, both partners should work to understand each other's needs. If the author has been avoiding touch for a long time and only recently changed his behavior (but now refuses to hide his feelings), he might be in the right to prioritize his own mental health. However, the fact that he's developing feelings for someone else while married complicates things. Even if he's not acting on them, the emotional infidelity could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, if the marriage was already emotionally distant and the author is now being honest about his inability to meet his wife's needs, it's a matter of whether the marriage can or should continue. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing his own happiness over maintaining a marriage that's causing him and possibly his wife distress. \n\nIn many cases, staying in an unhappy marriage can be harmful to both individuals. The author's actions might be a step toward seeking a more fulfilling life, though the method of communication is crucial. Since he's not acting on the feelings for the other woman, maybe the main issue is the lack of touch, which is a separate issue. If the wife's needs for physical affection aren't being met, that's a significant problem in the marriage. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he's been feeling this way for a long time and only recently stopped hiding it. If the marriage was already strained, and he's now being honest, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, the sudden change and his attraction to another woman might make others think he's in the wrong for not addressing the issues within the marriage first. \n\nIn summary, the author is in a complex situation. The decision to avoid touch and the development of feelings for someone else are both factors. The key is whether he's being inconsiderate to his wife's needs. If the marriage was already problematic, maybe he's justified in seeking a way out, but the way he's handling it could be seen as abrupt. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about marriage and responsibility. Considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not addressing his wife's emotional needs and is instead using his new feelings as a justification for his behavior without proper communication or effort to resolve the marriage issues first.\n"
