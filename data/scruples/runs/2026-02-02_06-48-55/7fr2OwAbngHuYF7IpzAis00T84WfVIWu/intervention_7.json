My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a man in a 20-year marriage. He mentions that they got married because both were lonely and afraid of being alone forever. He wasn't entirely sure about the marriage but went through with it. Now, after 15 years and two kids, he's been through depression and therapy. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife and feels trapped. But he used to just endure it. Recently, he developed feelings for a friend, which gave him the idea that ending the marriage might be a happy option. Now, he's pulling away from his wife when she wants touch, which is causing her distress. He's conflicted: he doesn't want to end the marriage over a crush, but he also can't go back to how things were.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to be physical with his wife and for pulling away because of his feelings for another woman. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the context.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics of their marriage. They were both lonely and rushed into marriage. The author wasn't entirely committed and felt trapped. He had depression that he kept hidden, which is a heavy burden. His therapy helped him understand his feelings, which is positive. Now, he's acting on his feelings, which have changed. He's no longer suppressing his discomfort with physical touch. But he's also developed a crush on someone else. \n\nThe key points here are his emotional state, the history of the marriage, and the recent shift in his behavior. He's changed because he's more self-aware now, which is a result of therapy. However, the sudden change in behavior is hurting his wife. She sees him as the best thing that ever happened to her, and he's now pulling away, which is causing her devastation. \n\nIs it wrong for him to prioritize his own feelings? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to feel valued and respected. If he's been unhappy for a long time and now is acting on that, is he in the wrong? Or is his wife responsible for not noticing his emotional withdrawal before? The fact that he kept his depression a secret might be a factor here. He didn't communicate his feelings earlier, which could have led to the current situation. \n\nNow, the new development with the friend might be a trigger, but he's using that as a reason to consider ending the marriage. However, he's not acting on the affair yet\u2014just the emotional connection. The question is whether his actions (pulling away from his wife) are justified given his long-term dissatisfaction. \n\nMarriage is a commitment, and both partners have responsibilities. If he's been unhappy for years and now is acting on it, maybe the fault isn't entirely his. But the way he's handling it\u2014suddenly withdrawing without addressing the underlying issues\u2014might be hurtful. He should have communicated his feelings earlier, not just hide them. Now, his wife is suffering because of his sudden change. \n\nBut he also mentions that he's been feeling trapped and hollow for a long time. His therapy helped him realize that he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore. Is it wrong to pursue happiness? However, the method of distancing without communication might be the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" morally if his feelings are genuine and he's been struggling for years. But he is in the wrong if he didn't communicate his feelings earlier and is now causing sudden pain without addressing the marriage's issues. However, since he's been in therapy and is working on self-awareness, maybe he's not at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. If his feelings are real and he's been struggling, then it's his right to seek a life where he's happy. However, the way he's handling it without proper communication could be the issue. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for acting on his genuine feelings after years of suppression. The problem might be the approach, but the feelings themselves are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
