My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore. The scenario is a 20-year marriage with kids, and the husband has been dealing with depression and now has feelings for another woman.\n\nFirst, the husband admits he wasn't fully committed in the beginning, which might have contributed to his current feelings. He's been in therapy to deal with depression, which is a valid reason for changes in behavior. But now, he's pulling away physically from his wife, which is causing her distress. He's also developing a close relationship with a female friend, which could be a red flag for infidelity or emotional cheating.\n\nThe key points here are communication and intention. The husband didn't just stop being affectionate; he had a new emotional connection that made him reevaluate his marriage. However, he hasn't communicated his feelings to his wife, leading her to feel confused and hurt. His actions are causing her emotional pain without her understanding why. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, both partners have a right to affection. If the husband is no longer able to provide that, it's important to address the underlying issues and talk openly. By not being honest and suddenly pulling away, he might be inconsiderate of his wife's feelings. Plus, the attraction to another woman could be a significant factor here, and how he handles that is crucial. If he's considering leaving, that's one thing, but if he's just being emotionally distant without addressing the relationship's future, it's another. \n\nOn the other hand, he's been struggling with depression and is now making changes because he's more self-aware. He might be in a better place to express his true feelings instead of suppressing them. But the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away suddenly without explanation\u2014is causing harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the husband is in the wrong because he's not being communicative with his wife and is acting on new feelings without addressing the long-term implications of his actions. His wife deserves to know the truth and to have a say in the future of their marriage. The sudden change in behavior without explanation is unkind and inconsiderate, which makes him at fault here.\n"
