My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want to touch his wife anymore, and he's pulling away. He mentions being in therapy and dealing with depression, and he found someone else who he's developing feelings for. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics of their marriage. They've been married 20 years, with two kids. The husband admits he married her out of fear of being alone, not because his heart was into it. That sets up a foundation of an unhappy marriage from the start. He later developed depression, which he's addressing through therapy. Now, he's feeling more emotionally aware and is rejecting his wife's physical affection because it makes him feel trapped and hollow. However, this change comes after he's formed a connection with another woman.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is being honest about his feelings, which he's worked on through therapy. He's expressed that he's not in the right place emotionally in the marriage and is now acting on his true feelings. That could be seen as taking responsibility for his own happiness. On the other hand, abruptly pulling away from his wife after 20 years might be traumatic for her, especially since she claims he's the best thing in her life. Also, introducing another relationship while married is generally considered unethical, unless they're going through a proper separation or divorce.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The husband didn't communicate his feelings before suddenly changing his behavior. His wife is now hurting and confused. Even if his feelings for the other woman are genuine, acting on them without addressing the current marriage is problematic. Also, the fact that he's in a crisis of his own (depression, therapy) might mean he's not in a stable place to make decisions about his marriage. \n\nAnother angle is the suddenness of his change. He says he's had these feelings for a long time but only recently decided to act on them. The wife is being left without warning, which can be cruel. The husband's actions could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own needs without considering the impact on his wife and children. \n\nHowever, if the marriage was already unhappy and he's now being honest about his feelings, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away emotionally and physically, and engaging with another woman\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and communication, which seems lacking here.\n\nSo weighing all that, the husband is in a tough spot, but his actions of moving towards another person without addressing the marriage first might make him at fault. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not handling the situation with the care it needs, even if his feelings are valid.\n"
