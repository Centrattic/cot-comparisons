My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The situation involves a long-term marriage with a history of emotional struggles. The husband is dealing with depression and has been in therapy, which helped him understand his feelings more. Now, he's pulling away physically from his wife because of discomfort, but he's also developing feelings for another woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The marriage was formed out of loneliness, and the husband felt trapped. His depression and the fact that he sought therapy show he's working on himself. However, the key issue is his physical withdrawal and the new emotional attachment. \n\nMarriage requires mutual respect and communication. The husband is now acting on his feelings, which are genuine, but he's not just ending the marriage; he's emotionally connecting with someone else. Even though he's not having an affair, the emotional infidelity could be seen as a betrayal. His wife is hurt and seeking answers, which shows she values the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is struggling with his emotional state and is trying to be honest about his feelings. He doesn't want to stay in a situation that makes him unhappy, but he's also hesitant to end a 20-year marriage. The dilemma here is between personal happiness and commitment to the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If we look at the traditional view, once married, you're supposed to work through issues. But if the marriage is already broken and the husband is trying to be honest, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, developing feelings for someone else while still married, even if there's no physical relationship, can be considered emotionally wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's pulling away from his wife physically without clear communication about his broader emotional state could be seen as a failure to address the root issues. He might need to have a more open conversation with his wife, possibly with the help of a therapist, to navigate this. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. He's seeking authenticity and his own well-being, which is important, but the emotional impact on his wife is significant. The answer likely depends on cultural or personal beliefs about marriage and emotional fidelity. Since the user is asking for a binary answer, A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong), the key factors are the emotional infidelity, lack of clear communication, and the sudden change in behavior. \n\nThe husband's actions are causing pain to his wife, and while he's being honest about his feelings, the way he's handling the situation might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's a strong argument for B as well if prioritizing personal happiness and honesty. Given the emotional connection with another woman, even without physical infidelity, it's a complex situation. However, in many perspectives, emotional involvement with someone else while married is a breach of trust, making A the more likely answer. But since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" and considering his mental health journey and the marriage's troubled history, it's still a tough call. I think the answer is B because he's taking steps to address his genuine feelings and past issues, even if it's painful.\n"
