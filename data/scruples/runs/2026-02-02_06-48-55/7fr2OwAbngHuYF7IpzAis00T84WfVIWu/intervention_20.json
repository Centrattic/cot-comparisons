My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe man is almost 50, married for 20 years, two kids. He says he married his wife because they were both lonely and scared of being alone. He didn't have his heart in it and felt trapped. Now, he's been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, which he only addressed after therapy. Recently, he's developed feelings for an attractive, smart friend who's also around 40. They've been spending time together, and this has made him consider ending the marriage. He's now pulling away from his wife when she wants to touch him, which has devastated her. He's conflicted but doesn't want to go back to how things were before. He asks if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial marriage dynamics, his mental health journey, the new attraction, and the current conflict with his wife. \n\nFirst, the marriage was built on fear of being alone rather than genuine affection. The man felt trapped and wasn't emotionally invested from the start. That's a red flag, but he's been in the marriage for 20 years, so there's a long-term commitment here. He had a major depression he didn't share with his wife until he got help. Now, his feelings for another woman have shifted his perspective on ending the marriage.\n\nHe's now acting on his feelings by pulling away from his wife physically, which is hurting her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nOn one hand, he's been in therapy, which is helping him understand his emotions. He's realizing that being with his wife makes him feel hollow and trapped. If he's been feeling this way for a long time but only hiding it, maybe he's now being honest about his feelings, even if it's difficult. On the other hand, he's been married for two decades and has kids. Ending a marriage over a new attraction might be seen as irresponsible, especially if he's not sure if the feelings for the friend are real or a temporary phase. Also, he's causing his wife emotional pain by suddenly withdrawing affection after years of being together.\n\nThe wife says he's the best thing that ever happened to her. If he leaves, she might feel betrayed and lose her support system. The man seems to acknowledge the conflict but isn't sure if it's a passing phase. His reasoning is that if a new relationship is possible, maybe ending the marriage could lead to happiness. But is that a valid justification?\n\nMarriages require work, and if he's been unhappy for a long time, maybe there were signs he ignored. However, he's only now becoming honest about his feelings. Is it fair for him to stay in a marriage that's making him mentally and emotionally unwell? Or is he just using the new attraction as a catalyst to end something that was already problematic?\n\nAlso, the act of pulling away from his wife is causing her distress. Even if he's not happy, his actions are contributing to her emotional pain. If he's considering leaving, should he communicate openly instead of withdrawing? But he's not ready to end the marriage yet, just exploring the possibility.\n\nI think this is a complex situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because his feelings are real and he's been struggling for years. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014suddenly pulling away without open communication\u2014could be hurtful. Maybe he should be in counseling with his wife first to explore if the marriage can be salvaged or if a divorce is necessary. But since he's in therapy, maybe that's part of the process.\n\nAlternatively, his actions are causing immediate harm to his wife, so even if he's not happy, he might be in the wrong for not addressing it through proper channels instead of letting things escalate. It's hard to say without more context about their marriage dynamics. But based on the information given, I'm leaning towards thinking he's not entirely in the wrong because he's acting on genuine emotional needs and the marriage might have been unhealthy from the start. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is a middle ground, but the question is A or B. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to decide.\n"
