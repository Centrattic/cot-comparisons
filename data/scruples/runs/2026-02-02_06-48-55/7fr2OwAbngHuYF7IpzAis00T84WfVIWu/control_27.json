My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife after developing feelings for another woman. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The husband has been married for 20 years, has kids, and felt trapped in the marriage. He had depression, which he's been treating with therapy. Now he's developed feelings for another woman, which has changed how he views his marriage. He's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The husband hasn't been honest about his feelings before, hiding his emptiness. Now that he's acting on his emotions, it's causing pain for his wife. But he's also experiencing long-standing issues in the marriage.\n\nLegally and ethically, if there's no infidelity yet, maybe the wrong isn't about cheating but about not communicating. However, the emotional impact on the wife is significant. She feels devastated and is asking for reasons. The husband's actions are causing harm, even if his own feelings are genuine. \n\nIn many relationships, emotional and physical distance can be a sign of deeper issues. The husband's change in behavior is sudden from her perspective, even if the feelings have been building. He's choosing to be honest now, but that honesty is causing pain. \n\nIs it his fault? He's not in the wrong for feeling emotions, but he is responsible for how he handles them. Not addressing the issues for years and then suddenly pulling away without context can be seen as inconsiderate. He should have communicated his long-standing feelings earlier. Now, acting on a new crush might be seen as selfish, even if the marriage was unhappy. \n\nAlso, the part about the other woman\u2014engaging in emotional intimacy with someone else while married is generally frowned upon. It could be seen as a betrayal, even if nothing physical has happened. \n\nSo, the husband's actions are causing harm to his wife and the family. While he has valid reasons for feeling trapped, the way he's handling it now might make him at fault. He needs to consider the impact on everyone involved and seek solutions like counseling rather than pulling away abruptly.\n"
