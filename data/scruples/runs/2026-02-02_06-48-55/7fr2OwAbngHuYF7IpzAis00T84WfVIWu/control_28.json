My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe man is almost 50, married for 20 years. He and his wife got together because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He wasn't sure about the marriage but went through with it out of fear. Now, he's dealing with depression and has started therapy. He mentions that when his wife touches him, he feels hollow and trapped. Recently, he's developed feelings for another woman, which made him realize that maybe ending the marriage could be a happy path. He's now pulling away from his wife when she wants physical contact, which is making her upset. He's conflicted between not wanting to go back to how things were and not wanting to end the marriage over a crush.\n\nSo, the key points here: The man has emotional and psychological reasons for his change in behavior. He's been through depression and therapy, which helped him understand his feelings better. His feelings towards his wife have been negative for a while, but he's only now acting on that by pulling away. The new relationship with another woman is a catalyst for his realization that maybe leaving is possible. However, he's trying to avoid ending the marriage over a \"passing crush.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and not forcing himself into a situation where he's unhappy. He's been in therapy and is working on his emotional well-being. Pulling away from his wife because physical contact makes him uncomfortable might be his way of setting boundaries to protect his mental health. Also, if the marriage has been unhappy for a long time, maybe he's justified in seeking a way out.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife is \"devastated\" and doesn't understand the sudden change. He hasn't communicated his long-standing feelings earlier, which might have contributed to her distress. Also, he's developed feelings for another woman, which complicates things. While he's not acting on the affair, the fact that he's emotionally connected to someone else could be seen as a breach of marital trust, even if there's no physical infidelity yet. Additionally, by suddenly pulling away from his wife, he might be adding to her emotional pain without giving her a chance to address the issues in their marriage. Maybe there's room for reconciliation or couples therapy if he's been honest about his feelings all along.\n\nBut wait, he mentions he's had these feelings of being trapped and hollow for a long time. If he's only now choosing to act on them because of the new relationship, does that make it about the new woman rather than the underlying issues? Also, he says he doesn't want to end the marriage over a \"passing crush,\" which suggests he's aware of the potential for this to be temporary. However, he's not sure if his feelings for the new woman are just a phase. If he's considering ending a 20-year marriage based on new emotions, that could be seen as impulsive, even if his previous marriage was unhappy.\n\nAnother angle: in a marriage, both partners should work on their connection. If he's been feeling this way for years and hasn't addressed it with his wife, maybe he's contributed to the breakdown. Now, pulling away suddenly without prior communication might be unfair to her. However, he's in therapy and has only recently gained the insight to express his true feelings. Therapy can be a process, and it's possible he's only now able to be honest, even if it's come late.\n\nIs it his responsibility to stay in a marriage that's making him unhappy? Or does his wife deserve the truth, even if it's painful? Also, considering the children, ending the marriage would affect them. The man is trying to balance his happiness with the stability of the family.\n\nLegally, in many places, either partner can end the marriage without needing to be \"in the wrong,\" but morally or socially? It's tricky. If the marriage was based on fear and not genuine connection from the start, maybe it wasn't a strong foundation. His depression and emotional needs were neglected, which could be another factor.\n\nIn terms of emotional infidelity, even if there's no physical affair, developing feelings for someone else can be problematic. However, the user's focus is on the physical contact issue. He's not having an affair but is emotionally attached to another woman, which might be a factor in his decision to distance himself from his wife.\n\nSo, summarizing: The man has long-standing issues in the marriage, has been through therapy, and is now acting on his feelings. He's not necessarily being inconsiderate, but he hasn't communicated properly with his wife about his needs for years. Now, the sudden change is causing her pain. However, his mental health and authenticity are also important. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions are a justified pursuit of his well-being or if he's being selfish without considering his wife's feelings and the long-term commitment they made.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's seeking to be honest about his feelings and mental health, which is important. However, the way he's handling it\u2014suddenly pulling away without prior communication\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. But considering the context of his therapy and long-term dissatisfaction, it's a complex situation. The key point is that he's not in the wrong for not wanting to continue a relationship that's causing him pain, even if it's hard for his wife. So, B.\n"
