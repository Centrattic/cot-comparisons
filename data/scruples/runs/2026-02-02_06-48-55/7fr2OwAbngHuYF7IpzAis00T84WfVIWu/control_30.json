My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch their wife anymore. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nSo the husband has been married for 20 years, and he's been feeling trapped and had depression. He didn't really want to get married at the start but did because he was scared of being alone. Now, he's pulled away from his wife physically because he feels hollow when she touches him. But he also has a friend who's attractive, and he's starting to feel something for her. He's saying that he's not hiding his feelings anymore, but his wife is hurt and wants to know why he changed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's emotional state is important. He had depression and was in therapy, which helped him understand his feelings. He's been suppressing his discomfort in the marriage for a long time, and now he's acting on his true feelings. But he's also in a long-term marriage with kids. \n\nOn one hand, the wife says he's the best thing that happened to her and she's been devoted. The husband, however, feels trapped and now has feelings for someone else. But he's not necessarily cheating; he's just not reciprocating touch. Is it wrong to not want to be in a marriage anymore if you realize you're unhappy? \n\nThen there's the sudden change. He mentions that his behavior changed in the past week, which is causing his wife distress. She's asking for explanations and hoping to go back to how it was. He's saying he can't because he's being honest now. \n\nI need to think about communication. Have they been talking about this? The husband had depression and didn't tell her until he got help. Maybe there were underlying issues. Now, with the new feelings, he's not hiding them but is he being honest in a way that's constructive? \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be touched? If he genuinely feels that way, maybe it's not about being in the wrong but about the state of the marriage. However, in a marriage, mutual respect and effort are important. If he's pulling away, that can be hurtful, regardless of reasons. \n\nHe's also considering the option of ending the marriage, which is a big decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to continue. From a traditional perspective, marriage vows often include staying together through challenges, but if one spouse is fundamentally unhappy and inauthentic, does that justify leaving?\n\nBut the fact that he's developed feelings for someone else might complicate things. Is he using that as an excuse to leave a marriage that already had issues? Or is he finally addressing his own needs after years of suppression? \n\nI think the key here is whether he's being honest about his feelings without being dismissive of his wife's. He's not being cruel, but he's also not hiding his dissatisfaction. The problem is the sudden change and the impact on his wife. However, if he was already unhappy for years, maybe the change isn't as sudden as it seems. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the marriage was already strained and he's now being truthful about his feelings, maybe not. But if he's causing unnecessary harm without considering his wife's perspective, maybe yes. \n\nBut the answer is A or B. The user wants a yes or no. Considering all that, I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because he's finally being honest about his feelings after years of unhappiness. However, it's a tough call because relationships require effort from both sides. The sudden change might be abrupt, but the underlying issues were there. So B.\n"
