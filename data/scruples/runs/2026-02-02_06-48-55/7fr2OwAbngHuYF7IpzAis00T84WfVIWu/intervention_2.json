My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who's been married for 20 years but doesn't feel connected to his wife anymore. He's been struggling with depression, went to therapy, and now he's pulling away from his wife when she wants physical affection. He's developing feelings for another woman, which makes him realize he might want to end the marriage. The wife is hurt and confused, asking why he changed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong) is the answer. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband was in a marriage that started from fear of being alone. He wasn't emotionally committed. Then he had a depression episode, got therapy, which helped him understand his feelings. Now he's not hiding his discomfort with his wife's touch. He's honest about not wanting to go back to the previous state. \n\nBut he's also developing a relationship with a friend, which adds to his emotional state. The key points here: Is he in the wrong for being honest about his feelings and not wanting to continue a marriage that's unfulfilling? Or is he in the wrong for not maintaining the marriage despite his issues?\n\nMarriage is a commitment, and he's been married for 20 years. He's been with someone who's been supportive, as she called him the best thing in her life. Now he's pulling away because of new feelings and his own emotional needs. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and seeking his own happiness. On the other, he's in a committed relationship and is forming an emotional connection with another person, which could lead to infidelity or divorce. His actions are causing his wife emotional pain. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for prioritizing his own emotional needs over staying in a marriage, even if it's causing pain. Some might argue that he should work on the marriage, while others might say he's entitled to his happiness. \n\nBut the fact that he's forming a new romantic interest while still married complicates things. Even if he's not having an affair, the emotional connection is there. The wife is being left in the dark about his true feelings, and the sudden change in behavior is hurting her. \n\nHe might not be in the wrong if he's trying to be truthful about his feelings and considering ending the marriage. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without communication, leading her to be confused\u2014might be problematic. The key is whether he's being honest and working on the situation constructively. \n\nBut since he's considering leaving due to new feelings, and not addressing the existing marriage's issues, it's possible he's causing more harm by not being upfront. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. \n\nGiven the information, the user thinks A (he's in the wrong). The author's actions could be seen as abandonment or lack of commitment. However, others might empathize with his situation. But given that he's in a committed marriage and is emotionally connecting with another woman while causing his wife pain, A might be the right answer. So I think the answer is A.\n"
