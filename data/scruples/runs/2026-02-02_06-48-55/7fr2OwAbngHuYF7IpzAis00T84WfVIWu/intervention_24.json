My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife, given the context he's provided.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author married his wife out of fear of being alone, and he wasn't fully committed at the start. Over 20 years, there were two kids, and he experienced depression which he only sought help for later. Now, he's realizing he doesn't want physical contact with his wife, but he's found a friend who makes him feel wanted again. He's pulling away from his wife, which is causing her distress.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and the state of their marriage. The author admits that his feelings towards his wife have changed, and he's not hiding them anymore. However, he's not engaging with his wife about these changes, which might be causing her pain. The fact that he's been in therapy and is more aware of his emotions is a positive step, but how he's handling it could be problematic.\n\nThe wife is described as someone who values the marriage highly, saying he's the best thing that happened to her. The author's sudden withdrawal without addressing the underlying issues might be seen as neglectful. He's using his newfound awareness as a reason to pull away, but not engaging in open dialogue with his wife to seek solutions or explore if the marriage can be salvaged.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional responsibility. While the author might not be at fault for his feelings, how he handles the situation is crucial. Avoiding touch without explanation can be hurtful. He needs to communicate his needs and listen to her perspective, rather than just acting on his impulses.\n\nAnother angle is the possibility of infidelity. The author is drawn to another woman, but hasn't crossed that line. However, his emotional attachment to her might complicate things further. The question is whether his actions are justified in seeking happiness elsewhere, which could be seen as selfish if it's at the expense of his wife's well-being and the children.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that after 20 years, both parties should work through issues. Others might say that if the marriage is no longer fulfilling and the emotional connection is gone, it's better to part ways respectfully. The author's approach seems abrupt and lacks the necessary communication to handle such a significant life change.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without addressing it properly with his wife\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. He's in the wrong for not being transparent and supportive, which is essential in a long-term relationship.\n"
