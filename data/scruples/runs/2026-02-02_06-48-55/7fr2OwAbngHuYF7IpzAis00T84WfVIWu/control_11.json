My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is married for almost 20 years, and now they're having feelings for a friend. They've been struggling with their marriage for a while, feeling trapped, and now they're pulling away from their wife physically. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they married out of fear of being alone and weren't fully committed. Now, they feel a connection with someone else. They've started to reject their wife's affection because it makes them feel hollow. The wife is hurt and confused because the change is sudden.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the marriage was based on fear and insecurity, the author has been unhappy for years, found new feelings with a friend, and is now acting on those feelings. The wife feels abandoned. \n\nIn terms of moral or relationship ethics, being in a marriage and developing feelings for someone else is usually considered a problem. However, the marriage itself might have been strained from the start. The author's therapist helped them understand their emotions, which led to this realization. But acting on those feelings by pulling away and potentially leading the other woman on could be problematic. \n\nThe author isn't having an affair, but the emotional connection might be. They're also not hiding their feelings anymore, which is honest but could be hurtful. The wife deserves to know the truth, but the way the author is handling it (pulling away without communication) might be the issue. \n\nSo, the author's actions are causing their wife distress. While the marriage might have issues, the sudden change in behavior without clear communication could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is being honest with themselves but not with their wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for acting on their feelings or if the marriage's state justifies it. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they developed feelings for someone else and started to emotionally distance from their wife without addressing the underlying issues in the marriage. However, if the marriage was already failing, maybe it's a shared responsibility. But since the question is about the author specifically, their actions in pulling away and forming a connection with another woman might be considered wrong, even if the marriage had problems.\n"
