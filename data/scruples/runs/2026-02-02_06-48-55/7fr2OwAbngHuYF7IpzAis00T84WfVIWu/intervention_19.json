My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 40s who's been married for almost 20 years. He mentions that they got married because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He wasn't fully committed at the time, and he felt trapped. His wife says he's the best thing that ever happened to her. Over the years, he developed depression and suicidal thoughts, which he didn't share with her until he sought therapy. Now, after some time in therapy, he's realized he doesn't like being close to his wife anymore. When she touches him, he feels hollow and trapped. \n\nRecently, he developed feelings for a friend who's attractive and smart. They've been meeting up and chatting, which has given him hope that life post-marriage could be happy. This has shifted his perspective, making the fear of ending the marriage less daunting. As a result, he's started pulling away physically from his wife, which is causing her distress. She's asking why he changed and when he'll return to how he was before. He doesn't want to go back because he hated that situation, but he's also not sure if this is a passing phase or a more permanent change.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). The user thinks the author is wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's emotional struggles are real. He went through depression and therapy, which helped him understand his feelings. He's now being honest about not wanting to be touched by his wife, which might be a sign of his emotional state. However, his sudden change in behavior (pulling away) is causing his wife distress. She's been with him for 20 years, and he's been unfaithful in emotional terms, at least, by forming a close bond with another woman. \n\nOn the other hand, the marriage might have been unhappy for a long time. The author felt trapped and wasn't fully committed from the start. The wife's happiness is also in question; she claims he's the best thing for her, but if the marriage was built on fear and loneliness, maybe both were unhappy in different ways. Now that the author is more honest about his feelings, perhaps it's time to reconsider the marriage. \n\nBut there are two kids involved. Ending a marriage affects everyone, especially children. The author is in a position where he's not being physically or emotionally abusive, but he's not meeting his wife's emotional needs anymore. The affair with the friend is emotional, which is cheating in some definitions but not legally. However, it's still a betrayal of trust and could be seen as emotionally unfaithful.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014pulling away from his wife\u2014might be justified if he's genuinely unhappy and can't continue the marriage as it was. However, the way he's done it suddenly without communication might be harsh. He mentions he's not hiding his feelings anymore, but maybe he should have discussed this with his wife first rather than pulling away abruptly. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the marriage was already built on an unstable foundation, and he's now seeking a better life for himself, perhaps he's not at fault. However, the emotional connection with another woman complicates things. It's possible that his new feelings are genuine, but they also might have contributed to his desire to leave the marriage. \n\nConsidering all this, there's a mix of valid points. But in terms of responsibility, the author's actions are causing harm to his wife and family. Even if he was unhappy, the sudden change and emotional affair might make him at fault. Alternatively, if the marriage was already failing, maybe he's just being honest now. But the way he's handling it without addressing it with his wife might be where he's wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's causing his wife emotional pain without considering her feelings, and the emotional affair is a breach of trust, even if not physical. However, the user's perspective is that he's in the wrong, so maybe that's the intended answer here.\n"
