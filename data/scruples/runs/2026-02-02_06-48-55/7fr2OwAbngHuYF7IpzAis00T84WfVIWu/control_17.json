My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the person is married for almost 20 years, and now they're feeling trapped in the marriage. They mention not wanting to touch their wife anymore, which is causing her distress. The user is asking if the author is at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a marriage that started because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. They admitted they weren't fully committed at the beginning. Then they had depression and suicidal thoughts, which they've been addressing through therapy. Now, they're realizing they don't like being with their wife anymore and have feelings for another woman. Their response to their wife's touch is now negative, which is a change and causing her pain.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they're finally being honest about their feelings after years of pretending. They might be in a place where they can't continue the marriage as before. On the other hand, the marriage has lasted 20 years, and their wife is really hurting. The author's sudden change in behavior is causing her devastation, and they're considering if they should stay in the marriage despite the emotional turmoil.\n\nThe key points here are communication, the impact on their wife, and the reasons behind the author's actions. The author didn't just randomly decide to push their wife away; there's underlying emotional distress and a new relationship dynamic. However, the way they're handling it might be abrupt and not considering their wife's feelings. They mention they don't want to end the marriage over a \"passing crush,\" but their actions are making it hard for their wife to understand what's happening.\n\nI think it's important to consider if the author has been open and honest with their wife about their struggles before this point. If they were hiding their feelings for a long time and now are suddenly pulling away, it might be seen as unfair to their wife. The author might also need to think about whether the new feelings are genuine or a result of emotional pain and loneliness. Plus, there are two kids involved, so the impact on the family is significant.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" I have to decide based on typical social expectations. Marriages require effort from both sides, and if one person is unhappy and not fulfilling emotional needs, it could be a reason to consider ending it. However, the way the author is handling the situation\u2014suddenly withdrawing affection without clear communication\u2014might be hurtful and inconsiderate. They might need to approach the situation with more empathy and perhaps seek counseling together before making a decision. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could be handling it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they're acting out of self-awareness and trying to be honest after years of suppression, perhaps B (not in the wrong). But if they're causing unnecessary harm without proper communication, maybe A. It's tricky. I think the answer is B, because they're finally being honest about their feelings after a long period of unhappiness, even if the timing is rough.\n"
