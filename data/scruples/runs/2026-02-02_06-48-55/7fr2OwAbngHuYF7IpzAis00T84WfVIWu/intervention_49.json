My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is married for 20 years and has been feeling disconnected from his wife, even going through depression. He started seeing a psychologist and now is no longer hiding his dislike for physical contact with his wife. His wife is upset, and he's developed feelings for a friend. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married someone because he was scared of being alone, didn't have his heart in it, which might have been a problem from the start. Then, after years and children, he went into depression and sought therapy. Now, he's more aware of his feelings and doesn't want to be with his wife anymore. He's been pulling away from her physically, which is causing her distress. He's also developing a relationship with another woman. \n\nMarriage is a partnership, and both people need to feel respected and valued. The author's reasons for not wanting to be touched suggest a deep emotional disconnect. But he's not initiating an affair; he's just not hiding his feelings anymore. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without communication\u2014might be part of the problem. The wife is clearly hurt and confused. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not wanting the marriage anymore? Well, people's feelings can change, and if the marriage was built on inauthentic foundations, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But he's also not being open about his feelings. He's been distant for a long time and only changed his behavior recently when he found a new interest. That could be seen as using the new relationship as an excuse to end the marriage, which might make him at fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's been in therapy and working on his emotions is a positive step, but he hasn't communicated this to his wife. The wife feels devastated and is asking for explanations. Open communication is key in any relationship, especially in such a long-term one. By not discussing his feelings earlier and suddenly changing his behavior, he might have contributed to the current situation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the marriage was already not fulfilling and he's now being honest about his needs, maybe he's in the right. But the way he's handling it\u2014being emotionally distant and then pulling away physically\u2014without constructive dialogue could be wrong. The wife's feelings matter too; she's been devoted, seeing him as her best thing. \n\nSo, the author is in a difficult spot. He's not in the wrong for realizing his feelings, but he's in the wrong for not communicating them properly, leading to his wife's distress. The sudden change without prior discussion is a problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the way he's handling the emotional transition without considering his wife's perspective.\n"
