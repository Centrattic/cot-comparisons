My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The situation is a 20-year marriage, the husband is almost 50, and he's been struggling with feeling trapped and depression. Now he's connecting with another woman and is pulling away from his wife physically. The wife is upset because he's changed suddenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband's past issues with depression and therapy suggest he's been through a lot. He felt trapped in the marriage from the beginning, which might indicate that the marriage wasn't a healthy one from the start. Now he's feeling a shift because of a new friend, which gives him hope for a post-marriage life. But he's not acting on the affair; he's just not engaging with his wife physically anymore. \n\nHowever, the key point is that he's been emotionally distant for a long time and is now showing his true feelings. The wife is suffering because he's rejecting her touch. Even if his reasons are valid, the way he's handling it might be hurtful. He's not communicating effectively\u2014suddenly pulling away without explaining the depth of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's emotional state is real. He's been in therapy and is trying to be honest with himself. The sudden change is because of his newfound self-awareness, not a passing phase. He doesn't want to leave the marriage over a crush but is being true to his feelings. \n\nIs it his fault? Well, staying in an unhappy marriage for 20 years without addressing the issues could be problematic. But now, he's trying to be honest, even if it's painful. The wife's needs are not being met, but the husband's emotional struggle is real. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's been honest and is now acting on his true feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's handling the breakdown of the marriage could be considered hurtful. But given his history of depression and therapy, perhaps he's not at fault. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering he's seeking to be true to himself after years of unhappiness, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
