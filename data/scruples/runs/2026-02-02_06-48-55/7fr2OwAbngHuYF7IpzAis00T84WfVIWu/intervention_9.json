My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author is married for 20 years, feels trapped and unfulfilled, and now is avoiding physical contact with his wife because he's developing feelings for another woman. He's been through therapy for depression, which helped him understand his emotions better.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The husband is clearly unhappy in the marriage. He mentions that he married his wife out of fear of being alone and that his heart wasn't in it. Over time, he developed depression, which he's dealing with through therapy. Now, he's feeling more aware of his emotions and doesn't want to be with his wife anymore, which is causing her distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife thinks he's the best thing that ever happened to her. She's devastated by his sudden change in behavior, especially the withdrawal from physical affection. The husband is avoiding touching her, which is a significant part of a marriage. He's not just being distant; he's actively pulling away when she tries to connect physically. \n\nThe key here is communication. The husband has been through a lot and is now acting on his true feelings, but he hasn't effectively communicated this to his wife. Instead of being honest about his feelings and the reasons behind his withdrawal, he's letting it affect their relationship negatively. The wife is confused and hurt because the change is abrupt. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's developing feelings for another woman complicates things. Even if the marriage was unhappy, acting on those feelings might not be the healthiest approach. But the main issue here is his behavior towards his wife. By pulling away and not explaining his feelings, he's causing her emotional pain. \n\nIn a long-term marriage, if one partner is feeling unfulfilled, the right approach would be to have an open and honest conversation. Avoiding physical contact without explanation is hurtful. The husband needs to address the underlying issues in their marriage, whether that means working on it together or discussing the possibility of separation. However, he's not doing that; he's just withdrawing, which is unfair to his wife who is still emotionally invested and doesn't understand what's happening.\n\nSo, while the husband's feelings are valid and his past therapy shows he's trying to address his issues, the way he's handling the current situation is damaging. He should take responsibility for his actions and communicate with his wife instead of letting things escalate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions are causing harm without proper communication and consideration for his wife's feelings.\n"
