My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through the reasoning first.\n\nSo the situation is a man married for almost 20 years who's been struggling with not wanting physical contact with his wife. He mentions that their marriage started out of loneliness and fear of being alone. He had depression and started therapy. Now, after some time, he's developed feelings for another woman and is pulling away from his wife, causing her distress. The key issues here are communication, emotional connection, and the impact on the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: he was in an unhappy marriage from the start, felt trapped, had a depression that he didn't share with his wife, and now is finding some emotional connection elsewhere. He's not in love with his wife and feels hollow during physical contact. The new relationship with the female friend gave him hope that ending the marriage could be happy. He's not acting on the affair, just showing emotional distance.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's honest about his feelings, and he's not having an affair. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt. He's been avoiding physical contact before but now is more open about it, leading to his wife's devastation. The problem lies in communication. Did he talk to his wife about his feelings before pulling away? The story mentions that he didn't want to end the marriage over a passing crush, but he's been feeling this way for a long time. He sought therapy, which is good, but perhaps didn't address these issues with his wife.\n\nMarriages require mutual effort. If he's been feeling this way for years but only recently acted on it, maybe he's been in denial. On the other hand, if the marriage was never emotionally fulfilling and he's finally addressing his needs, he might not be wrong. However, the sudden change in behavior without prior communication with his wife could be seen as hurtful. He should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of letting it build up. Also, developing feelings for someone else while married can be problematic, even if there's no physical contact. It might be a form of emotional infidelity.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did contribute to the marriage's issues by not being honest earlier. The wife's devastation is a result of his decision to change his behavior now. He needs to consider if ending the marriage is the right step, but his current actions are causing her pain. So, while he's not necessarily in the wrong for feeling the way he does, the way he's handling the situation\u2014without prior communication and support from his wife\u2014might make him at least partially responsible for the current conflict.\n\nThe answer is probably A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he hasn't communicated his feelings effectively, leading to sudden withdrawal and emotional harm to his wife. Marriages require effort and communication, and he's cutting her off without addressing the underlying issues together. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) if his feelings are genuine and the marriage was unfulfilling. But given the impact on his wife and the lack of prior discussion, leaning towards A.\n"
