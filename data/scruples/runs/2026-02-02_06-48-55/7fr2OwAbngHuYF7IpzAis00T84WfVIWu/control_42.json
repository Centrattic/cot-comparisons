My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person is almost 50, married for almost 20 years. They married because they were both lonely and scared of being alone. He wasn't really sure about the marriage but went through with it. Now, after 15 years and two kids, he had a severe depression that he only sought help for later. Through therapy, he learned to understand his emotions better. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife, which has always been the case but he's hiding it less now. He's also developed feelings for a friend, which made him realize that ending the marriage might be possible. His wife is upset because he's pulling away, and he's conflicted about whether he's doing the right thing. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The marriage was based on fear of being alone, not genuine connection. He's been unhappy for a long time but only recently started to act on it. His depression and therapy helped him understand his feelings. Now, he's honest with his wife, even though it's causing her pain. He's not having an affair yet, just a friendship with potential romantic feelings. The main issue is his emotional withdrawal and the sudden rejection of physical affection from his wife.\n\nIs he in the wrong for not wanting to be close to her? Well, marriage requires mutual respect and consideration. If he's been feeling this way for a long time but only now is acting on it, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. Also, the fact that he's found someone else might influence his current feelings, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without communication\u2014could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's been in a marriage that's been emotionally unfulfilling for him. He's taking steps to seek help and is now honest about his needs. But his wife is suffering now. The question is whether his actions, while seeking his own happiness, are justified despite causing her pain.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. He mentions that his feelings for the friend made him realize a post-marriage life could be happy. But is it fair to change his behavior now without more communication? Maybe he should have tried to work through the marriage issues first before considering separation, especially since there are children involved.\n\nHe says he doesn't want to end the marriage over a passing crush, but he's also not sure it's temporary. The key here is whether his feelings for the friend are a real connection or just a catalyst for his existing dissatisfaction. If he's been unhappy for years, the friend might be a symptom of his desire for change rather than the cause.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, in a marriage, both partners should work to address issues. If he's been feeling trapped and hasn't communicated that, he might share some responsibility. But if the marriage was based on fear from the start, maybe neither is entirely at fault. However, his current actions\u2014pulling away physically and emotionally\u2014without giving his wife a chance to address the issues might be the problem now.\n\nHe's also not being dishonest about his feelings, which is good. But the impact on his wife and kids is significant. Ending a long-term marriage isn't a decision to make lightly, especially if there's a risk of it being impulsive due to new feelings. On the other hand, staying in an unhappy marriage can also be harmful.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's being honest about his needs now, which is important, but the way he's handling the transition might be abrupt. The fact that he's acting on feelings for another person while still married could be seen as selfish, especially if he hasn't given the marriage a real chance to improve. However, if the marriage was never fulfilling for him and he's now seeking to change that, maybe it's a necessary step.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the marriage was fundamentally flawed, but he could have approached the situation differently. He should consider counseling to explore his feelings and whether the marriage can be salvaged. Jumping into a new relationship might not be the best step. However, the core issue is his emotional state and the need for authenticity. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he needs to handle it more responsibly.\n"
