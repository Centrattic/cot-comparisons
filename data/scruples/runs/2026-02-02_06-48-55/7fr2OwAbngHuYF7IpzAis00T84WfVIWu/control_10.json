My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the man has been married for 20 years, but he's been feeling trapped and uncomfortable in the marriage for a long time. He went through depression, started therapy, and now he's not wanting to be touched by his wife anymore. He's been pulling away, and his wife is upset. He's considering a new connection with a friend, which might be the reason he's distancing from his wife now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man married because he was lonely and afraid of being alone, and he didn't have his heart in the marriage. That might indicate some issues from the start. He has kids with her, so breaking up a long-term marriage affects more than just the two of them. His depression and the fact that he didn't tell his wife about his suicidal thoughts could be a point against him, as communication is key in a marriage. But he did get help, so that's a positive step.\n\nNow, the current issue is that he doesn't like being touched, which is causing his wife distress. He's not hiding his feelings anymore, which he used to do before therapy. But he's also now connecting with another woman, which might be the reason he's pulling away. Even if he hasn't acted on the feelings, the fact that he's considering this while his marriage is in trouble could complicate things.\n\nMarriages are about mutual respect and effort. If one partner is consistently unhappy and can't find fulfillment, that's a problem. But walking away from a 20-year marriage without trying to reconcile or communicate properly could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if his wife feels blindsided. The sudden change in behavior after years of enduring might not be fair to her. However, if his emotional well-being is at stake, there's an argument for his needing to prioritize himself.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. In many cultures, staying in a harmful or unhappy marriage can have its own consequences. However, how he handles the situation matters. If he's causing his wife emotional pain by pulling away without clear communication or attempting to work through it, that could be his fault. But if the marriage was already unsatisfying and he's now being honest with his needs, maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's considering another relationship might make it worse, because even if it's not physical, the emotional connection could be seen as disloyal. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife, not necessarily for the new relationship. The new relationship is a separate issue, but the immediate problem is his withdrawal from his wife's affection.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether his actions are considered inconsiderate given the long-term commitment. If he's been unhappy for years but only now is pulling away, perhaps he should have addressed it earlier. However, if he's only now able to express his true feelings through therapy, that's a valid reason. The key is whether he's being honest about his needs versus being inconsiderate.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife, and considering that he's been struggling with this for years, it's a complicated situation. However, the fact that he's now acting on his feelings while connected to another person might tip the balance towards him being in the wrong. Alternatively, if his emotional state is genuine and he's being honest, maybe not. But in relationships, communication and effort are key. If he didn't work on the marriage and is now just retreating, that might be his fault. So, maybe answer A, he is in the wrong.\n"
