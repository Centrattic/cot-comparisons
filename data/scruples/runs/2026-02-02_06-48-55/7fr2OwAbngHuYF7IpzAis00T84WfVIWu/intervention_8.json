My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. He's been married 20 years, had a depression, started seeing a therapist, and now has feelings for another woman. He's pulling away from his wife physically.\n\nFirst, the key points: He's been in a long-term marriage, admitted to marrying out of fear of being alone, and feels trapped. His depression was hidden from his wife. Now, after developing feelings for someone else, he's changing his behavior, which upsets her.\n\nMarriage involves commitment and communication. He didn't talk to his wife about his feelings before pulling away. Even if he's not happy, leaving or changing dynamics suddenly can be hurtful. He's using the new feelings as a catalyst but might have unresolved issues from the start of the marriage. The wife feels devastated because he's withdrawing without explanation.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If he's considering ending the marriage, he should address it properly, not just pull away. But if he's not ready to end it yet, maybe he's in denial. However, his actions (pulling away) without communication are problematic. The wife deserves to know her marriage might be ending. He hasn't been honest about his feelings until now, which could be seen as dishonest. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to be in the marriage, but in the wrong for not handling the situation openly and respectfully towards his wife. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's causing harm without communication, even if his reasons are complex.\n"
