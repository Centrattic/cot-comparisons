My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore and pulling away. He mentions issues from their 20-year marriage, past depression, therapy, and a new friendship with an attractive woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The husband admits he married her out of fear, and their marriage started with both being lonely. There's a history of emotional issues, including his depression. Now, after therapy, he's more honest about his feelings but is avoiding physical contact with his wife. \n\nHe's developed feelings for another woman, which might be a red flag. Even if he's not acting on it, the emotional connection could be affecting his marriage. The wife is clearly hurt and trying to understand the sudden change. The husband's behavior is causing her distress, which is significant. \n\nHowever, he's also dealing with his own emotional growth and realizing that being with his wife makes him uncomfortable. It's a complex situation where his personal well-being is a factor. But in a marriage, both partners' needs are important. Avoiding physical contact without addressing it properly can harm the relationship. \n\nHe hasn't communicated openly about his feelings towards the other woman, which might be part of the problem. The wife deserves to know the reasons behind the change, even if it's hard. If his happiness is tied to ending the marriage, that's a serious decision that needs careful handling. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's not engaging in infidelity, but his actions are causing emotional harm. The key issue is whether he's being honest and communicative with his wife. If he's avoiding touch because of his feelings for another woman, that's a problem. But if it's about his genuine discomfort and he's not misleading her, it's a different angle. \n\nConsidering all factors, the husband hasn't been truthful about the source of his feelings, which could be why the wife is confused. He's not being entirely transparent, which is a breach of trust. So, he might be in the wrong for not addressing the root cause and for distancing himself without proper communication.\n"
