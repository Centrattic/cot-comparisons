My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The situation is pretty complex. The man has been married for 20 years, and he's been struggling with feeling trapped and depression. He found someone else but isn't sure if it's just a passing crush. His wife is really hurt and doesn't understand why he's pulling away now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. He mentions that they married because they were both lonely and unsure they'd find anyone else. His heart wasn't in it from the start, which might mean the marriage lacked a strong emotional foundation. Then, after 15 years and two kids, he developed depression, which he only addressed through therapy. That therapy helped him become more aware of his feelings and what he likes and doesn't like. \n\nNow, he's realizing that physical affection with his wife makes him feel hollow and trapped. He's been hiding these feelings but recently started to pull away when she wants to touch him. The change came after he met another woman and felt a connection. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to end the marriage over a \"passing crush,\" but he's also not the same person anymore.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, communication is key in any relationship. He didn't communicate his feelings earlier, which might have contributed to the current situation. But he's now being honest about how he feels, even though it's causing pain. His actions (pulling away) are causing his wife distress, but maybe they're necessary for his own well-being. \n\nHowever, entering into an emotional connection with someone else while married is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if it's not a physical affair, the emotional involvement could be seen as cheating, depending on the couple's boundaries. The wife is already hurt, and this might be the catalyst for the marriage's end, but the root issues were there for a long time.\n\nThe author is struggling between his own needs and the stability of the marriage. His actions are a result of his therapy and self-awareness, which is positive, but the way he's handling it might be abrupt and hurtful. He needs to consider his wife's feelings and perhaps seek counseling together before making decisions. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's not necessarily \"wrong\" for seeking happiness and wanting to be honest about his feelings, especially after years of suppression. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without a clear conversation about the future\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. There's a responsibility to communicate openly and consider the impact on his family. \n\nSo, the answer might not be a simple A or B. But since the user wants a choice between the two, I need to decide. If we go by the idea that he's finally being honest and his actions are a result of seeking therapy and self-awareness, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the emotional affair complicates things. But the main issue is his rejection of physical contact, which he's had for a long time but is now acting on. If he's not in the wrong, it's because he's prioritizing his mental health and honesty. If he is wrong, it's because he's causing pain without considering his wife's perspective. \n\nI think the key here is that he's not hiding his feelings any longer, which is a form of honesty. While it's painful, honesty is important in relationships. However, there's a responsibility to communicate and maybe work through issues together. The fact that he's considering the marriage's future and not just acting impulsively suggests he's trying to be thoughtful. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
