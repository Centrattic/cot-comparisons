My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife after years of marriage. The context is that the husband has been in a 20-year marriage with two kids, and he's been struggling with depression and a lack of emotional connection. He started therapy, which helped him understand his feelings. Now, he's developed feelings for another woman, and as a result, he's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their marriage. They both married out of fear of being alone, which might have contributed to a lack of genuine connection. The husband's depression and the fact that he didn't seek help until later suggests there were underlying issues that weren't addressed. His therapist helped him confront these emotions, leading to a realization that he doesn't want to continue the marriage as it is.\n\nNow, the key point is whether pulling away from his wife after 20 years is wrong. The husband is now being honest about his feelings, which he suppressed before. The wife is devastated because she believes he changed suddenly, but the husband feels he's been unhappy for a long time and is just now expressing it. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's actions are causing his wife emotional pain. She might feel rejected and uncertain about the future. The sudden change in behavior without prior communication could be seen as hurtful. On the other hand, he's been struggling in silence for years and is finally being authentic about his needs. There's also the aspect of his emotional growth through therapy, which is positive, but the way he's handling the situation with his wife might be problematic.\n\nThe husband is also having a relationship with another woman, which complicates things. Even if the feelings for the other woman are new, engaging in an emotional connection with someone else before addressing the marriage could be considered a betrayal. The wife's devastation is understandable, and the husband's withdrawal without a clear explanation might be seen as abandoning rather than addressing the issues constructively.\n\nHowever, considering the long-term unhappiness and lack of emotional intimacy, some might argue that the husband is taking a necessary step to acknowledge his true feelings. The question is whether being honest, albeit late and in a painful way, is the right approach. But the fact that he's not wanting to touch his wife now, leading to her distress, and the presence of another woman, could be seen as contributing to the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's a gray area. The husband's actions are driven by his need for emotional and physical connection, but the method he's using\u2014pulling away suddenly without clear communication and forming another emotional bond\u2014is likely causing more harm than good. The wife, who sees him as her best thing, is left in limbo without understanding the full extent of his feelings. The husband might need to have a more open and honest conversation with his wife about his feelings, rather than just withdrawing. So, while his feelings are valid, the way he's handling the situation could be considered in the wrong because it's causing harm without proper communication and resolution.\n"
