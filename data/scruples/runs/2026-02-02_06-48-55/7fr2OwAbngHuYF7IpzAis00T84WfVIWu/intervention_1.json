My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is married for 20 years, has kids, and has been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. They got help through therapy and now realize they don't want to be with their wife anymore. But the problem arises when the author starts pulling away physically because of a new friendship with an attractive woman. The wife is hurt and confused, and the author is torn between staying in an unhappy marriage or moving towards something new.\n\nThe key points here: the author didn't just abruptly decide to end the marriage. They've been struggling for years and only recently became more honest about their feelings. The new woman is a friend, but there's a spark and some emotional connection. The author is now acting on their true feelings instead of suppressing them, which led to the wife being devastated.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. In a marriage, both partners are supposed to work on the relationship, especially when there are issues. The author mentions that for years they were unhappy but tried to \"make it work.\" But now, they feel they can't pretend anymore. However, the way they're handling it is causing pain to their wife. Is that their fault?\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest now, which is important. But on the other hand, they didn't communicate their feelings earlier. They also started a new emotional connection while married, which could be seen as a betrayal. The wife had no idea about the depression and now feels rejected when the author pulls away.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. If the marriage was already unsatisfying and the author made an effort through therapy but still decided they can't stay, maybe they aren't wrong. But the sudden change without prior communication might be the issue. Also, developing feelings for someone else while married can be problematic, even if it's not a physical affair yet. The author is in a tough spot, but perhaps the fault isn't clear-cut. \n\nI think the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the author didn't address the underlying issues earlier, and the way they're handling the situation now is causing harm. But I'm not entirely sure since the author was trying to make the marriage work for a long time. It's a tricky balance between personal happiness and marital responsibility.\n"
