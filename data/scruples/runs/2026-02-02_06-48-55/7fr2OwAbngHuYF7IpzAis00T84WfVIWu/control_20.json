My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is married for 20 years, has kids, and has been struggling with emotional issues. They mention not wanting to touch their wife anymore after a change in their feelings, possibly due to a growing friendship with another woman. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a marriage that started from loneliness and fear of being alone. Over time, they developed depression and found therapy helpful. Now, they're no longer hiding their discomfort with physical contact, which upsets their wife. The wife is described as someone who sees the author as her best thing ever.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent in the marriage. The author is being honest about their feelings now, which they previously suppressed. However, the issue is whether this honesty is justified or if it's a betrayal. The author isn't having an affair but is emotionally connecting with another woman, which might be the catalyst for their change in behavior towards their wife.\n\nMarriage requires mutual respect and communication. If the author felt trapped and only started expressing their true feelings now, maybe they should have addressed the issues earlier. But given that they've been in therapy and are working on self-awareness, it's possible this is part of their healing process. However, suddenly pulling away from a spouse who relies on that affection could be hurtful. The author needs to consider their wife's feelings and the long-term impact on their family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to touch their wife? It's complex. If the aversion is due to genuine emotional issues and not just an affair, they might not be at fault. But they have a responsibility to communicate openly with their wife and seek solutions together. Cutting off affection without prior discussion might be the problem. The fact that they're considering the marriage's future and not wanting to end it over a crush suggests they're trying to be responsible. However, the way they're handling the change in behavior might be abrupt and damaging.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. But according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the author is being honest about their feelings after years of suppression and isn't engaging in an affair, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they're acting out on those feelings without addressing them with their wife could be problematic. But given the context of past issues and therapy, maybe they're justified. The answer is B.\n"
