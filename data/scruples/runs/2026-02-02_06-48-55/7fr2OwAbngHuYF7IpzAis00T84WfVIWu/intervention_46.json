My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person writing the story is in the wrong. The situation is a 20-year marriage where the husband (the author) is feeling disconnected and has entered a depression, which he addressed through therapy. Now, he's feeling more aware of his emotions and has developed feelings for another woman. As a result, he's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The marriage started with both feeling lonely and maybe not entirely committed. He married her out of fear of being alone. Over time, depression set in, and now he's going through therapy. The key point is that he's changed his behavior suddenly, pulling away from his wife, which is causing her significant emotional pain. He's trying to decide if this change is a permanent shift in his feelings or just a phase.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and seeking a more authentic life after years of being trapped in a marriage he wasn't fully committed to. On the other hand, his sudden withdrawal from a physical relationship is hurting his wife, who has been devoted for 20 years. The fact that he's developed feelings for someone else complicates things because it suggests infidelity or at least the beginning of it, which can be a breach of trust.\n\nBut wait, he hasn't actually cheated. He's just changed his behavior. Maybe the issue is about communication. He might not have been honest with his wife about his feelings for a long time, leading to this sudden change. The wife's reaction is understandable because she feels betrayed or unloved. The author's reasoning is that he's unhappy in the marriage and wants to avoid more emotional pain by ending it, but doing so abruptly without proper communication could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's been in therapy and is now more aware of his emotions is a positive step, but how he's handling the situation with his wife is questionable. He should probably address the root of his feelings (like his initial lack of commitment and depression) with her and seek couples counseling before making drastic changes. By pulling away suddenly, he might be prioritizing his own emotional needs without considering the impact on his wife and children.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the marriage was already unhealthy and unsatisfying for him, maybe he's not wrong to seek a change. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without open communication and by forming a relationship with someone else\u2014could be problematic. The key factors are communication, emotional honesty, and the well-being of the family. If he's been suppressing his feelings for years and now is acting on them without addressing the issues with his wife, that's a problem. However, if the marriage was already failing and he's trying to be truthful now, it's more about breaking the cycle of unhappiness.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if the marriage was built on inauthenticity from the start and he's now seeking truth. But his approach of pulling away and pursuing another relationship without proper communication could be where he's at fault. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about marriage and communication. Since the user thinks the answer is A (author in the wrong), but I need to evaluate based on the situation. Considering the sudden withdrawal and the development of feelings for another woman while in a committed marriage, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not handling the situation with the necessary care and communication, even if the marriage had issues. So the answer would be A.\n"
