My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The situation is that he's been married for 20 years, but he's been feeling trapped and disconnected for a while. He's been in therapy for depression and now, after meeting a female friend, he's changed his behavior towards his wife, pulling away from physical contact. His wife is hurting because of his sudden change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband mentions he got married out of fear of being alone, and his heart wasn't in it. He's been struggling with depression and only recently started opening up about his feelings. Now, he's trying to be honest about his current feelings but is causing his wife pain. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his emotions and needs, which is important in a relationship. If he's been feeling this way for years but was suppressing it, maybe pulling away is a way to finally express his true self. However, the way he's handling it is causing his wife distress. The sudden change without communication might be seen as hurtful. \n\nHe mentions that he doesn't want to end the marriage, but he's no longer hiding his feelings. The key point is communication. If he hasn't properly explained his feelings to his wife, especially the reasons behind his change in behavior, then he might be at fault. The wife is asking why the change and when it will stop, so she's seeking understanding. If the husband hasn't communicated this clearly, he's not being fully responsible. \n\nAlso, the presence of a new friendship with a woman adds complexity. While he says it's not a passing crush, being emotionally involved with someone else while married can be a breach of trust, even if physical boundaries are maintained. The husband might be creating a situation where he's emotionally invested elsewhere, which could be seen as unfair to his wife. \n\nHowever, the husband's main issue is the lack of emotional connection and the resulting emptiness in the marriage. He's trying to be honest about his feelings, which is a positive step. The problem is how he's communicating these feelings and the impact on his wife. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have roles. The wife's feelings are valid, and the husband needs to address her emotional needs while also being honest about his. But since the husband is the one making a sudden change without prior communication, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent and for potentially causing harm through his withdrawal. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong for not properly communicating his feelings and for creating emotional distress without addressing it with his wife first.\n"
