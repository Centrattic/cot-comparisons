My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch their wife. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author married their wife because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He wasn't entirely sure about the marriage but went through with it. Now, after 20 years and two kids, he's dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. He started therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better. Now he's realizing he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore and has feelings for another woman. He's pulling away physically, which upsets her. He's conflicted between ending the marriage and not wanting to do it over a \"passing crush.\"\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author's actions are affecting his wife. She's described as someone who considers him her best thing, and she's devastated by his change. He's been avoiding physical contact, which is a significant part of a marriage. But he's also been suppressing his feelings for a long time due to fear of being alone or fear of divorce.\n\nEthically, marriage is about mutual respect and communication. If he's been unhappy for years and is now acting on his true feelings, even if it leads to the marriage ending, is that his fault? Or is he responsible for the emotional impact on his wife and children? There's a balance between personal happiness and the consequences of ending a long-term relationship. \n\nAlso, the presence of children complicates things. Ending the marriage could affect them. But staying in an unhappy marriage isn't healthy either. The author is now being honest about his feelings, which he previously avoided. Is it wrong to seek happiness, even if it causes pain? Or is he wrong for leading his wife on for so long and then suddenly changing?\n\nAnother angle: he didn't have an affair, but he's forming a close bond with another woman. That's a red flag in the marriage. His wife might feel betrayed if she finds out about the new relationship. But the question is specifically about not wanting to touch his wife. Is it wrong to not want physical contact, given his feelings of emptiness and fear?\n\nCommunication is key. If he hasn't been honest with his wife about his feelings for a long time, that's part of the problem. Now that he's opening up, maybe he should be doing it more carefully. But he's trying to be honest now, even though it's causing pain.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not willing to work on the marriage and instead is seeking another relationship, maybe yes. But if his feelings are genuine and he's been struggling with depression and emotional disconnection, maybe not. It's tricky. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, in relationships, both parties are responsible for communication and effort. If he's been hiding his true feelings and suddenly pulling away, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, his mental health is also a factor. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if there's a justification. If he's being honest now, perhaps he's in the right. But if he's causing unnecessary pain without trying to resolve issues, maybe not. The key points are the long-term unhappiness, the sudden change, the new relationship, and the impact on the family. \n\nHmm. I think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's seeking to address his genuine feelings and mental health, but he's also not handling the transition properly, which could make him at least partially at fault. But the question is a binary choice between A and B. If the main issue is avoiding touch and considering leaving, maybe the answer is A or B. Given that he's been unhappy for years and is now being honest, perhaps B (not in the wrong). However, leading his wife on and then suddenly pulling away without effort to fix things could be A. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because he's addressing his true feelings and mental health, even if the timing is tough.\n"
