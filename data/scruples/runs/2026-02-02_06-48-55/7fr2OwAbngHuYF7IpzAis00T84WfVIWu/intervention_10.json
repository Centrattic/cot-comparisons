My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a man who's been married 20 years and now doesn't want to be touched by his wife anymore. He's been in therapy for depression and is realizing he doesn't want to be with her. He's connecting with another woman and is considering ending the marriage. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married someone because he was afraid of being alone, and now he's questioning that choice. He's been hiding his feelings for a long time, and after meeting a friend who might be into him, he's decided to be honest. The wife is upset because he's pulling away, and he's conflicted about whether this is a passing phase or a real change.\n\nSo, the question is about whether he's at fault. The main factors here are the long-term marriage, the emotional state, and the possibility of infidelity or ending the marriage. In a long-term relationship, communication is crucial. If he felt trapped and didn't communicate his feelings earlier, that's a problem. But now, he's opening up, which might be necessary for his well-being. However, he's also developing a connection with another woman, which could be seen as a betrayal even before the marriage is over.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is being inconsiderate by suddenly pulling away, especially after years of being in the marriage. The wife has a right to feel hurt, and the way he's acting might be abrupt. But he's also in therapy and trying to address his emotional issues, which is a valid step. The issue is whether his actions are justified or if he should have handled it differently.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, staying in a marriage despite unhappiness is seen as a commitment, but in others, personal well-being is important. Also, developing feelings for someone else while married can be complicated. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally connecting and meeting with another woman might cross a line.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he didn't address the issues earlier and is now using a new relationship as a reason to pull away. The wife has been supportive and believes in the marriage, so his sudden change and lack of communication could be considered unfair. However, if he's truly unhappy and the marriage is causing him distress, he might not be entirely at fault. But the way he's acting without considering the impact on his wife and kids might tip the scales.\n"
