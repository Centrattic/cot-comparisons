My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term marriage where the husband is struggling with feelings of being trapped and has developed a crush on a friend. He's pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband married his wife when he was unsure, maybe out of fear of being alone. He had depression and started therapy. Now, he's feeling different emotions, and a connection with another woman has made him consider ending the marriage. He's not hiding his feelings anymore and is avoiding his wife's touch, which is hurting her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here. Marriage is a commitment, and both partners have needs. The husband's emotional state and past depression are important. He's been unhappy for a long time but is now addressing it. However, suddenly pulling away from a spouse, especially after 20 years, can be very damaging. Communication is key in a marriage. If he hasn't discussed his feelings openly before this change, maybe that's a problem.\n\nOn one hand, he's been suppressing his feelings and now is acting on them, which could be seen as being true to himself. On the other hand, his wife has been counting on his presence and affection, and his withdrawal is hurting her without prior communication. The fact that he's considering the marriage's future because of a new attraction might complicate things. Also, his depression and therapy suggest he's working on himself, but maybe he hasn't fully processed everything before making this decision.\n\nThere's a balance between personal well-being and the impact on the spouse. If the marriage has been unsatisfying for him and he's not in a healthy place, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away suddenly without prior discussion\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. It's possible he's not in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to address his needs, but maybe he's not handling it well. Alternatively, he might be in the wrong for not maintaining the marriage despite his struggles. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, in many ethical frameworks, maintaining communication and considering the spouse's feelings is important. So, maybe he's in the wrong (A) because he's causing harm without prior discussion. But if his emotional well-being is a priority, perhaps not (B). I'm a bit torn here but leaning towards A since the sudden change without communication could be seen as selfish.\n"
