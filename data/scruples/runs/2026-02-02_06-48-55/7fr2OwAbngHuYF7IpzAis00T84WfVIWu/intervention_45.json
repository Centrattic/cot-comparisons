My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the husband has been married for 20 years and admits he married his wife out of fear of being alone, not because his heart was in it. That sets a foundation of an unhappy marriage from the start. Over time, he developed depression and started therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better. Now, he feels trapped in the marriage and is pulling away physically, especially after developing feelings for another woman. His wife is hurt and confused because he's changing his behavior suddenly.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is being honest about his feelings now, which might be necessary for his well-being. He's not initiating an affair, just distancing from his wife. But on the other hand, he married with emotional reservations and now is acting on his feelings while his wife still sees him as her best thing. The sudden change in behavior is causing her emotional distress, and he's not being completely upfront about the reasons (i.e., his feelings for another woman), which could be seen as a lack of communication and respect for her.\n\nMarriages require mutual effort and communication. The husband's past actions (marrying out of fear) and current behavior (withholding affection without clear communication) could be seen as contributing to the problem. While he's addressing his own needs, the way he's handling it might be hurtful. He's in therapy, which is positive, but the timing and approach to his wife matter. The question is whether his actions are justified given his history and current emotional state.\n\nI think the key here is the sudden withdrawal without addressing the root issues in the marriage. Instead of working on the relationship or communicating openly, he's acting on new feelings, which might be a catalyst but not the core issue. His wife's feelings are valid, and his abrupt change is causing her pain. So, while he's not necessarily in the wrong for having feelings, his actions in withdrawing and not addressing the marriage's issues properly could be considered wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
