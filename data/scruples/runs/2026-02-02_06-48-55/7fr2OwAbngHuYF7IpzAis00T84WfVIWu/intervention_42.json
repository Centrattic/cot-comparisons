My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a man in a 20-year marriage who's been feeling disconnected for a while. He's been through depression and therapy, and now he's starting to pull away from his wife physically because he's developed feelings for a friend. His wife is upset and doesn't understand the sudden change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author married his wife out of fear of being alone, which suggests the marriage might not have been built on a strong foundation. He went through depression and only recently started addressing his feelings with therapy. Now, he's finding some emotional connection with another woman, which has shifted his perspective on his marriage. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether he's in the wrong. He's not having an affair yet, just developing a crush. He's being honest with his wife about pulling away, which he previously suppressed. The wife feels devastated because the change is sudden to her. However, the author believes he's been struggling for a long time and is now trying to be authentic. \n\nOn one hand, abruptly changing physical affection can hurt his wife, especially without prior communication. But on the other hand, he's been unhappy for years and is now seeking genuine happiness. The question is whether his actions are justified given his emotional state and the history of the marriage.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether he's being truthful and respectful in his communication with his wife. He's not being dishonest but is choosing to act on his feelings. However, ending a long-term marriage isn't something to take lightly. The author might need to consider if there's any possibility of reconciling or working through this together, rather than immediately pulling away. But given his past, maybe he's not at fault for wanting to seek happiness if the marriage is unfulfilling. Hmm, tricky. I'm leaning towards him being in the right (B) because he's addressing his own needs after years of suppression, but the way he's handling it could be improved. Maybe he should communicate better to help his wife understand the long-term issues before the sudden change.\n"
