My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-term marriage where the husband has been feeling disconnected and now is pulling away physically because he's developing feelings for another woman. His wife is upset because he's been avoiding touch and intimacy.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions that their marriage started as two lonely people trying to avoid being alone. He wasn't fully committed at first but stayed because he was afraid of being alone. Now, after 20 years, he's dealing with depression and found someone else who makes him feel like maybe he could be happy outside the marriage. He's stopped engaging in physical affection with his wife, which is causing her distress.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the husband's emotional state, his therapy progress, and the impact on his wife. The wife feels devastated and is asking why he changed and when he'll return to how he was. The husband feels trapped in the marriage and is now honest about his feelings, which has led to a sudden change in behavior.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore? Well, if he's genuinely feeling disconnected and the relationship isn't fulfilling for him anymore, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But he's been in therapy for depression, which might have helped him realize his feelings. However, the way he's handling it now\u2014pulling away and possibly engaging with another woman\u2014could be seen as unfair to his wife, especially since she's been supportive and sees him as her best thing.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of communication. The husband admits he didn't tell her about his depression until he got help. Now, he's not explaining his sudden change in behavior. The wife is confused and hurt because he's cutting off physical contact, which is a significant part of a marriage. Even if his feelings for the other woman are real, acting on them while still married could be considered infidelity, which is a breach of trust.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong just for not wanting to touch his wife. If the issue is that he's physically and emotionally detached, maybe that's a result of his own unresolved issues. However, the fact that he's now exploring a relationship with someone else while still married complicates things. He's causing emotional harm to his wife by not being honest and by withdrawing affection without clear communication.\n\nSo, the husband's actions\u2014both the withdrawal and the development of feelings for another woman\u2014contribute to the problem. The wife is left in the dark, feeling rejected and abandoned. Even if the marriage wasn't perfect, he has a responsibility to his wife to handle the situation with honesty and care. By not communicating openly and acting on his feelings prematurely, he's causing her unnecessary pain.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife and for creating emotional distance without addressing the underlying issues in their marriage. He should be working through this with his wife and therapist instead of seeking solace in another relationship.\n"
