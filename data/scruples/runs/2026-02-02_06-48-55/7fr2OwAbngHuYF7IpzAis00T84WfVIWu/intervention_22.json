My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The man has been married for 20 years and is now almost 50. He mentions that they got together because they were both lonely and afraid of being alone. He didn't have much emotional investment initially but stayed because he was scared of being single forever. Now, after years of marriage and two kids, he's going through depression and suicidal thoughts. He sought therapy, which helped him become more in touch with his feelings.\n\nThe key issue now is that he doesn't like being touched by his wife anymore. He feels trapped and hollow when she touches him. But he's also terrified of ending the marriage. However, he's developed feelings for another woman, which has made him reconsider his situation. He's been pulling away from his wife physically, causing her distress. He's conflicted between not wanting to go back to how things were and not wanting to end the marriage over a \"crush.\"\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, marriages require work from both partners. If he's been struggling emotionally for a long time and now is acting on new feelings, maybe there's some responsibility in not addressing the issues earlier. But he did seek therapy, which is a positive step. However, pulling away from a spouse without communication might be hurtful. The wife is devastated because she doesn't understand the sudden change. The author is honest about his feelings but hasn't communicated them effectively. Maybe he should have addressed the emotional distance earlier instead of letting it build up. Also, developing feelings for someone else and acting on them, even if it's a spark, can be seen as emotionally unfaithful. The question is whether he's wrong for not wanting to continue the marriage as it was, or if he should have worked through the issues. Since he's considering ending the marriage, maybe it's not entirely his fault, but his actions in pulling away without clear communication and developing feelings for someone else could be seen as wrong. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn. Maybe B if the marriage was already broken and he's trying to find a way out. Hmm.\n"
