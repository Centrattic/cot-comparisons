My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author is a husband who's been married almost 20 years. He married his wife when they were both lonely and maybe not entirely committed. He felt trapped and wasn't sure about the marriage from the start. Over time, he developed depression and sought therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better.\n\nNow, he doesn't like being touched by his wife anymore; it makes him feel hollow and trapped. He's also developed feelings for a friend, which made him realize that maybe ending the marriage could be a possibility. He's pulling away from physical contact with his wife now, which is causing her emotional pain. The wife is confused and hurt, asking why he changed and if he'll go back to the way things were. The author isn't sure if he's in the wrong for not wanting to return to the previous state of the marriage, especially since he felt unhappy for so long.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the marriage started on shaky grounds, the husband's emotional struggles and therapy, his current feelings for someone else, and the immediate change in how he interacts physically with his wife. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I should consider the marital context. If the marriage was built on mutual loneliness and fear of being alone, maybe neither party was fully committed from the start. The husband's depression and subsequent therapy suggest he's worked on understanding his feelings, which might be a valid reason for his current emotional state. However, the sudden change in behavior\u2014pulling away physically\u2014has hurt his wife. She's been with him for 20 years, has two kids, and sees him as the best thing in her life. He's now emotionally and physically distant, and she's not getting closure or understanding.\n\nLegally, in many places, neither party is \"in the wrong\" if the marriage is dissolving due to irreconcilable differences, but the ethical aspect is different. Ethically, the husband is not engaging in an affair yet, but is emotionally connecting with another woman, which could be seen as a breach of trust even without physical contact. However, the main issue here is his withdrawal from his wife and the impact on her.\n\nHe's not cheating, but he's emotionally distant and not communicating his needs effectively. He's also not being transparent about his reasons for pulling away. The wife is clearly in pain because he's become emotionally and physically distant. The husband's actions are causing her distress, and he hasn't addressed it with her honestly. Instead of open communication, he's reacting by pulling away.\n\nMarital counselors often emphasize communication and mutual effort in a relationship. If the husband feels trapped and unhappy, ending the marriage might be necessary, but he needs to handle it with care and respect for his wife's feelings. By not being honest and by withdrawing suddenly, he's contributing to her emotional suffering without providing the necessary support or explanation.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's depression and therapy are valid personal issues, but they don't absolve him of responsibility in maintaining the marriage unless both parties agree to its dissolution. The fact that he's considering leaving because he found someone else might be a factor, but he's not acting on the affair itself, just the emotional shift.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on his actions toward his wife. He's not being honest with her about his feelings, is causing her pain through his withdrawal, and hasn't effectively communicated his needs or intentions. Therefore, even if the marriage is failing, his approach is ethically questionable because it's not respectful of his wife's emotional well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because he's not handling the situation with the necessary communication and empathy toward his wife.\n"
