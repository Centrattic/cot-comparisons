My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is married for 20 years, with two kids. The marriage started because both were lonely and afraid of being alone. The author wasn't fully committed but went through with the marriage. Now, after a long time and depression, he's realizing he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore. He feels trapped when she touches him. \n\nHe found a friend who's a woman his age, and there's some attraction. This makes him consider ending the marriage. But he's conflicted because he doesn't want to end a 20-year marriage over a crush. However, he's no longer hiding his feelings and is pulling away from his wife, which is hurting her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's being honest with his feelings now, but he's been avoiding them for years. His sudden change is causing his wife distress. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize his own feelings over the marriage. \n\nOn one hand, he's finally addressing his emotional needs after years of suppressing them. On the other, his wife feels betrayed and abandoned. The kids are involved too. If the marriage was already unhappy and he's now seeking a way out, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But by having a friend with whom he's developing feelings and then pulling away from his wife, he's creating a situation that could be seen as leading towards infidelity or at least emotional unfaithfulness. \n\nHe hasn't acted on the feelings with the friend, just talking and meeting occasionally. But the fact that he's now emotionally distant from his wife and seeking validation elsewhere might be crossing a boundary. Also, the wife feels devastated and is asking for reassurance, which he's not giving. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he should have addressed his feelings earlier instead of letting the marriage deteriorate. His sudden change without communication about the deeper issues might be seen as inconsiderate. However, staying in an unhappy marriage could also be harmful. \n\nI think the key here is whether his actions are justified in the context of his own well-being versus the impact on his family. The fact that he's been in therapy and is learning to express his emotions better is a positive step, but he's now making decisions that affect others. \n\nHe might not be in the wrong, but he's definitely in a complicated situation where his actions are causing pain. The answer might hinge on whether the friend situation is appropriate. If there's no affair yet, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he's on a path that could lead there. \n\nAlternatively, by being honest about his feelings, even if it leads to divorce, he's being authentic. But he should handle it responsibly, communicating with his wife rather than just pulling away. Since he hasn't directly answered her questions and is causing her distress, that's part of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing his feelings after years of suppression and is trying to be honest, even if it's difficult. But there's a nuance where he should have communicated better earlier and handled the friend friendship more carefully.\n"
