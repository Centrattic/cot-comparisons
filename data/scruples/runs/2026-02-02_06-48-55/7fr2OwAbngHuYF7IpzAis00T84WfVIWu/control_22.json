My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is a man in a 20-year marriage, feeling trapped and unhappy. He married his wife when they were both lonely, and it wasn't based on strong feelings. He later developed depression, which he addressed through therapy. Now, he's experiencing negative emotions towards his wife, especially regarding physical touch. He's developed a connection with another woman, which gave him the courage to consider ending his marriage. However, he's not sure if his sudden rejection of his wife is justified.\n\nThe key points are: he's been unhappy for a long time, sought therapy, and now is acting on his feelings. His wife is hurt and doesn't understand the sudden change. The author is conflicted between staying in an unfulfilling marriage and moving towards something new.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, staying in a marriage where one is unhappy and resentful can be harmful. However, the way he's handling it now by pulling away from his wife without clear communication might be seen as abrupt. The wife feels devastated, indicating she needs understanding and communication from him. The author might be in the right in seeking happiness, but he might be in the wrong for not addressing the issues properly, like having an open conversation about his feelings instead of just pulling away. Also, developing feelings for another woman while married is generally considered cheating unless both parties agree, which is not mentioned here. So, he's in a difficult position, but the way he's handling the situation could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but in many contexts, working through issues in a marriage is expected before seeking an exit. However, if the marriage was never fulfilling and he's made an honest effort to address it, he might not be entirely at fault. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
