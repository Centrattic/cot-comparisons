My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 20-year marriage where the husband no longer wants to be touched by his wife and has been pulling away. He mentions feeling trapped in the marriage for a long time, and recently developed feelings for another woman. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He says he married her out of fear of being alone and wasn't fully committed. Then he had depression and started therapy, which made him more aware of his feelings. Now, with the new friend, he's feeling more hopeful about life after the marriage. But his wife is hurt because he's suddenly pulling away physically.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's honest about his feelings now. He's not cheating, but he's not meeting his wife's emotional needs by avoiding touch. But on the other hand, he's been struggling with these feelings for years and is now acting on his truth. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt and without sufficient communication. He's changed suddenly without explaining his long-term issues, which might make his wife feel rejected or blindsided. Even though his reasons are deep, the sudden change could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut also, staying in a marriage where you feel trapped and are unhappy isn't healthy. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch her. If the marriage is already emotionally broken down, maybe he's not at fault. But the fact that he's developing feelings for someone else while still married complicates things. However, he hasn't acted on the feelings beyond a friendship, so maybe it's more about his emotional state than infidelity.\n\nI think the key points are his communication (or lack thereof) with his wife about his feelings and the sudden change in behavior. He might be in the wrong for not addressing his issues earlier and being honest sooner, leading to the sudden withdrawal. But he's also seeking therapy and trying to be honest now. It's a tricky situation. Maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's finally being truthful about his feelings, but the way he's handling it could be improved. But since the question is a binary A/B, I need to choose. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But considering that he's been struggling for years and is now seeking a way out, maybe he's not. Hmm.\n"
