My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the husband has been married for 20 years but has been feeling trapped and disconnected for a long time. He went through depression and therapy but now feels different, especially since developing a crush on another woman. His wife is upset when he pulls away physically, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their marriage. The husband married because of fear of being alone, maybe without being fully committed. Over 20 years, there were two kids, but he's been struggling with depression and emotional disconnection. The key point here is that he's not suddenly changing his feelings because of an affair or infidelity, but due to a new emotional connection. However, the fact that he's now pulling away from his wife is causing her distress.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and communication. Even if his feelings are genuine, the way he's handling the change might be abrupt. He hasn't communicated his feelings openly with his wife, which could be part of the problem. Instead of pulling away, maybe he should have discussed his feelings and explored options together, like counseling. By suddenly becoming distant, he's hurting her without explanation, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's been feeling trapped and only now is able to express his true feelings, it's understandable he's conflicted. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting to be with his wife anymore, especially if his marriage was based on insecurity from the start. But in terms of responsibility, he still has obligations towards his wife and kids. Ending a marriage is a big decision, but avoiding intimacy without explanation can be harmful.\n\nSo, the husband's sudden withdrawal without proper communication might be where he's in the wrong. Even if his feelings are valid, the approach is causing pain without giving his wife a chance to address the issues. Therefore, he might be at fault for not handling the situation more compassionately and communicatively.\n"
