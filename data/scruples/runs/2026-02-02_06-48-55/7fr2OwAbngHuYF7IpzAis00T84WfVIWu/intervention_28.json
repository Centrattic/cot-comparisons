My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The story is about a man who's been married for 20 years but feels disconnected, even to the point of depression. He starts developing feelings for another woman and starts pulling away from his wife physically. His wife is upset and he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man married his wife out of fear of being alone, which might have been a shaky foundation. He had a depression and got therapy, which helped him confront his feelings. Now, he's experiencing a change where he's no longer hiding his discomfort with his wife's touch. He's developed a friendship with another woman that has romantic elements. He's not cheating, but he's emotionally and physically pulling away from his wife.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's honest about his feelings now. He's been through therapy and is trying to be true to himself. On the other hand, his abrupt change is hurting his wife, who doesn't understand why he's changed. He hasn't been open with her about his past feelings of being trapped or his depression, which might have contributed to the current breakdown in communication.\n\nMarriage requires mutual effort and communication. If he didn't address his feelings earlier and now is changing his behavior without explaining it to her, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the marriage was based on fear and he's now trying to find happiness, that's a personal struggle. But acting on a new attraction while married could be seen as infidelity, even if it's just emotional. However, the story doesn't mention physical infidelity, just emotional connection. \n\nThe wife feels betrayed because he's pulling away. He's not being honest with her about the root of his feelings, which might make her feel abandoned. His therapy helped him realize his feelings, but he needs to communicate this with his wife. The fact that he's considering ending the marriage because of this new connection might mean that he's using this as a justification, even if he's been unhappy for a long time.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not being honest and is using the new relationship as an excuse, maybe. But he's also trying to be true to himself after years of suppression. It's a tough call. The fact that he didn't address his feelings earlier and is now making abrupt changes without communication could place the blame more on him. The wife has been supportive and he's only now pulling away without explanation. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being honest and transparent from the start. But he's also in therapy, which shows he's trying to improve. Hmm. This is complex.\n"
