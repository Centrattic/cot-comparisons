My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man is married for almost 20 years, has two kids, and has been dealing with depression. He went into the marriage because he was lonely and afraid of being alone, and he wasn't fully committed. Now, after therapy, he realizes he doesn't want to be close to his wife anymore. He feels trapped when she touches him. But he also has a new friend, an attractive woman, and he's developed feelings for her. Now he's pushing away his wife, which is causing her distress. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: long-term marriage, emotional issues, therapy leading to self-awareness, the emergence of feelings for another woman, and the decision to distance from his wife. \n\nFrom a marital perspective, when someone starts developing feelings for another person and begins acting on them, that can definitely strain the existing relationship. Even if the marriage wasn't fulfilling for both partners, acting on a new attraction can be seen as betrayal. The wife is hurt because he's suddenly pulling away, and he's not communicating the reasons clearly to her. He mentions he doesn't want to go back to how things were before, which was a situation where he was unhappy but at least maintaining the facade. Now, his actions are causing her pain, even if his intention is to seek a healthier situation.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of his emotional state. He's dealing with depression and had suicidal thoughts, which are serious. Therapy helped him realize his feelings and the lack of connection in his marriage. The fact that he's now honest about his feelings might be a step towards his own well-being. But is that a valid reason to hurt his wife? \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs matter. His need for emotional authenticity and his own happiness is important, but so is his wife's need for emotional support and the stability of a marriage. If he's not in love and is repelled by her touch, that's a significant issue. But acting on a new attraction, even if it's not a physical affair yet, can be seen as emotionally cheating. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's choosing to be honest about his feelings and seek a better life, even if it means ending the marriage, some might argue he's not at fault. Others might say he should have worked on the marriage first or communicated his issues earlier. The fact that he had a 20-year marriage and kids complicates things. Ending it now might be traumatic for the family, but if the marriage was already unfulfilling, maybe it's better.\n\nBut acting on the new relationship without giving the marriage a chance to address these issues could be problematic. He might need to have a serious conversation with his wife, maybe counseling, to explore if the marriage can be salvaged. By suddenly pulling away and not explaining, he's causing her distress without considering her perspective. That could make him at fault.\n\nAlso, the emotional support he provided to his wife over the years is something to consider. If he's the \"best thing\" to her, leaving might be devastating. But he's also struggling with his own mental health. It's a tough balance.\n\nIn conclusion, while his personal growth and honesty are important, the way he's handling the situation\u2014suddenly distancing without communication and pursuing another relationship\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate towards his wife. He might need to take responsibility for the impact of his actions on her and the family, which could mean he's at least partially at fault. But it's a gray area where both sides have valid points.\n"
