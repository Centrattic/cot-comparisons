My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore. He's been married for 20 years, had a troubled marriage from the start due to fear of being alone. He fell into depression, got therapy, and now he's developed feelings for another woman. He's pulling away from his wife physically, which is hurting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He mentions that his marriage started on shaky ground\u2014both were lonely and married out of fear. He didn't have his heart fully in it. Over time, he developed depression, which he only addressed through therapy. Now, he's feeling a shift because of a new friendship with a woman. The key points here are his emotional state, the history of the marriage, and the sudden change in behavior.\n\nHe's not having an affair, but the emotional connection he's forming with this other woman is giving him hope for a post-marriage life. His pulling away from his wife is a result of his realization that he doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore. But he's also conflicted about ending a 20-year marriage over a new crush. \n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, being in a marriage and emotionally connecting with someone else could be seen as infidelity. However, he hasn't crossed into physical or explicit emotional commitment beyond friendship. But the fact that he's avoiding his wife, who is already in emotional distress, might be seen as neglectful. \n\nHe's being honest with his feelings, but the way he's handling it is causing pain. The wife feels abandoned, and he's not giving her the support she needs. However, he's also struggling with his own emotional health. The dilemma is between honesty and the impact on his wife.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's complicated. He's not necessarily wrong for wanting to pursue happiness if the marriage was already unhappy. But he's also not being entirely communicative and supportive to his wife through this transition. The sudden change without addressing the root issues might be harsh, but his own well-being is also a factor.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because maintaining a marriage without emotional engagement can be harmful, and the way he's handling the situation is causing distress. Alternatively, it could be B (not in the wrong) if one believes personal happiness and honesty are more important. But the key here is the emotional impact on his wife and the lack of communication. He's pulling away without clear communication, which is unkind. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
