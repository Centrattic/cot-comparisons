My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife anymore. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is married for 20 years, has two kids, and has been dealing with depression. They met as lonely people, and he was unsure about the marriage. Now, he's developed feelings for a friend and is pulling away from his wife physically. He's been avoiding touch and says he doesn't want to go back. The wife is devastated and doesn't understand the sudden change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's reasons are rooted in his mental health and realization that he's unhappy. He sought therapy, which is a positive step. But the sudden change in behavior is causing distress for his wife. The key points are his past depression, the new emotional connection, and the impact on his marriage.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, both partners have responsibilities. If one partner is emotionally withdrawing, especially leading to a desire to end the marriage, communication is crucial. The author hasn't been honest about his feelings until now, perhaps. The wife was unaware of his depression and now he's pulling away, which could be seen as a betrayal even if there's no affair yet. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to be honest now. He's not cheating but is exploring the possibility of leaving. The question is whether his actions are justified. On one hand, he's seeking happiness and authenticity. On the other, his wife is hurting. \n\nBut the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without full disclosure\u2014could be harmful. Maybe he should have addressed the marriage issues first before emotionally investing in someone else. Cheating isn't happening, but emotional infidelity can still be damaging. The wife might feel betrayed by his emotional connection with another woman. \n\nAlso, the author's past of being in the marriage out of fear (\"I married her... because I was afraid I'd be alone forever\") might mean he's not in the right place to evaluate his feelings now. The therapist might have helped him realize his needs, but acting on them without considering the consequences for his wife and kids could be problematic. \n\nBut he's also dealing with his mental health and growth. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to continue a marriage that he's found unfulfilling. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, in many perspectives, ending a marriage is a significant decision that affects everyone involved. The sudden withdrawal of affection and emotional engagement without proper communication could be seen as neglectful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest and supportive, even if his feelings are genuine. He needs to address the marriage issues openly rather than distancing himself and forming a new emotional bond. His actions are causing harm, even if he's trying to find his own happiness. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
