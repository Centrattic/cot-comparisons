My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year marriage with two kids, and the husband has been feeling trapped and hollow for a long time. He had a depression and started therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better. Now, he's developing feelings for another woman and has started to pull away from his wife physically, causing her to be devastated.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The husband's perspective is that he's being honest about his feelings now, but he's also considering the long-term impact of ending a 20-year marriage. He's scared of being alone but also of staying in an unhappy marriage. His wife sees him as the best thing that happened to her, which adds to the moral dilemma.\n\nOn one hand, he's not in the wrong for having feelings, right? People can fall in love or develop new emotions. But the issue is how he's handling it. He's not just having feelings but actively pulling away from his wife physically, which is part of a committed relationship. The wife is hurt and doesn't understand the sudden change. He mentions that the change seems sudden to her, but he's been feeling this way for a while and just didn't act on it. However, by now rejecting her touch and not explaining, he's causing her pain. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's been in therapy and realized his heart wasn't in the marriage before suggests there were underlying issues. But maybe he should have addressed those earlier instead of letting it fester. Now, with the new friend, he's considering leaving, but he's unsure if it's a passing phase. The wife's devastation is there, and he's not giving her a chance to address the problem or seek help for their relationship. \n\nSo, the key factors are: long-term unhappiness, therapy revealing lack of true commitment, new emotional attachment, and the impact of his actions on the wife and children. The husband is choosing to prioritize his own emotional state by withdrawing, but it's causing harm to his family. There's a conflict between personal happiness and the existing commitment. \n\nIs it fair to pull away now without trying to resolve the marriage first? The wife might not know about the depression and emotional struggles if he hasn't communicated them. The husband is hiding his true feelings for years and then suddenly acts on them, which could be seen as irresponsible. Also, the kids are involved, so the decision affects their lives too. \n\nBut maybe the husband is in the right because he's finally being honest and seeking a healthier situation for himself. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt and without proper communication. The post says he's scared of the marriage ending but now feels it's a possibility. The problem is that he's not being transparent with his wife about his feelings, leading to her confusion and hurt. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the husband had discussed his feelings of being trapped and his depression earlier, perhaps the marriage could have been salvaged. Now, by withdrawing affection without explanation, he's causing additional harm. The new relationship with the friend might be a complicating factor, but the core issue is the lack of communication and the existing emotional disconnect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing the root issues in his marriage and is instead using a new attraction as a trigger to end the relationship without trying to resolve things with his wife first. The fact that he's been aware of his feelings for years and only now is acting on them without prior effort to mend the marriage suggests he's at fault here.\n"
