My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is a man who's been married for 20 years, but he's not feeling connected to his wife anymore. He's been avoiding physical contact, and his wife is upset. He's also developing feelings for another woman, which is causing him to feel more confident about ending the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband says he's been unhappy in the marriage for a long time, felt trapped initially, and now has a new perspective after therapy. But he's pulling away from his wife, which is hurting her. The wife is described as someone who really values him, saying he's the best thing that ever happened to her. She's likely feeling confused and rejected now that he's changed his behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important. But he's also causing pain to his wife by withdrawing from her. In a marriage, communication is key. He didn't talk to her about his feelings before pulling away. Instead, he's acting on his sudden change, which might not have considered her needs or their long-term relationship. The fact that he's having feelings for someone else while married complicates things. Even though he's not acting on the affair physically, emotionally it's still an issue. \n\nHe's also considering ending the marriage, but he's not sure if it's the right move. He doesn't want to destroy a 20-year marriage over a \"passing crush.\" However, he feels the change isn't temporary. But is his reaction to his feelings justified? By pulling away and not communicating, he's contributing to his wife's distress. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings with his wife first before pushing her away. \n\nOn the other hand, staying in an unhappy marriage can be harmful to both people. If he's genuinely not happy and has found someone who makes him feel better, maybe ending the marriage is necessary for his well-being. But the way he's handling it is problematic. He should have had an open and honest conversation with his wife instead of just changing his behavior and making her figure out why he's distant. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings properly, which led to his wife's devastation. He should have addressed the issues in the marriage before considering an exit. However, his feelings are valid, and if the marriage was never fulfilling, he might need to end it. But the method of handling it is flawed. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but in terms of responsibility, he's at fault for not being proactive in communication.\n"
