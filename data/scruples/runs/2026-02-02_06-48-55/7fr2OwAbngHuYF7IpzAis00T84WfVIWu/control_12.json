My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through the situation carefully first.\n\nThe author is in a 20-year marriage, but he's been feeling trapped and disconnected for a while. He mentions that he married his wife when they were both lonely and unsure, and he wasn't fully committed. Over time, he developed depression and suicidal thoughts, which he only addressed through therapy. Now, he's realizing he doesn't like being with his wife anymore and is pulling away physically because she makes him feel hollow and trapped. However, he's also afraid of ending the marriage. Recently, he's formed a connection with a female friend, which has given him hope for a post-marriage life that could be happy. This has made him stop hiding his feelings, leading to his wife's devastation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: a long-term marriage with emotional disconnect, the husband's realization of his feelings, the impact of therapy, and the new emotional connection. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be touched by his wife anymore and pulling away.\n\nOn one hand, he's been through a lot, felt trapped, and now is finally being honest about his feelings. He's not acting out of a passing crush but from a deeper realization through therapy. His actions are causing his wife pain, which is unfortunate. On the other hand, he's been in the marriage for 20 years, has children, and his wife sees him as the best thing in her life. By pulling away without trying to work through it together, he might be abandoning her without giving them a chance to address these deeper issues. Also, developing feelings for someone else while married can be seen as infidelity, even if there's no physical contact yet. The emotional affair could be considered a breach of trust.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't having an affair; he's just emotionally connected to a friend. However, the act of forming such a bond while married can still be harmful. The main issue here is his withdrawal from his wife. Withholding affection is a significant change that causes her distress. He's choosing to be honest about his feelings, but in a way that's abrupt and without communication. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier rather than waiting until he found someone else. Also, considering the years they've been together, there's a responsibility to work through problems, not just walk away when it becomes too hard. His depression and therapy were important for his mental health, but now he's making a decision that affects his family. The children, the wife's well-being, and the stability of the family unit are all factors here.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's a complex situation. If he's genuinely unhappy and the marriage was based on fear and not true commitment from the start, maybe ending it isn't entirely his fault. But the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without communication, developing feelings for another woman\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and hurtful. He's not wrong in feeling the way he does, but his actions in how he's handling the situation might be. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to be honest about his feelings and not wanting to continue the marriage, even if it's causing pain now.\n\nI think there's a balance here. While he has valid reasons for his feelings, the abruptness and the emotional connection with another person before addressing the marriage could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife is being honest about her feelings too, but she's been in the marriage for 20 years. The author's actions might be justified in terms of his mental health and self-awareness, but the way he's executing the change could be more compassionate. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not communicating properly and is emotionally involved with someone else. But some might argue B because he's finally being honest after years of suppressing his feelings. It's really a tough call.\n"
