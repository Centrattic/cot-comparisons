My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who's been married for 20 years but doesn't want to touch his wife anymore. He's been through depression and therapy, and now he's developing feelings for another woman. He's pulling away from his wife, which is hurting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man married out of fear of being alone and wasn't emotionally invested initially. Over the years, he had a depression episode and started therapy. Now, he's feeling different emotions and is connecting with another woman. He's not engaging with his wife physically now, which is causing her distress.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the husband is experiencing genuine emotional changes and has a history of mental health struggles. Therapy helped him understand his feelings better. He's been honest about his lack of emotional connection in the marriage for a long time, but the sudden change in physical rejection is new.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has been devoted for 20 years, raised kids, and sees him as her best thing. The husband's actions are causing her pain. Even if his feelings are real, he has a responsibility as a spouse and parent to consider his wife's well-being. The fact that he's forming a connection with another woman while married might be seen as a breach of commitment, regardless of his emotional state.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's not in a temporary phase but has a change in how he feels. However, the wife deserves honesty and communication. Maybe he should have addressed the marriage's issues earlier instead of waiting until he found someone else. Pulling away suddenly without prior communication could be seen as abandonment.\n\nAlso, the presence of children complicates things. Divorce would affect their kids, so the husband should weigh the impact on the family. While he's not in love with his wife anymore, he has a duty to handle the situation responsibly, perhaps seeking counseling together before making a drastic decision.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's feelings might be valid, his actions of emotionally withdrawing and forming a new relationship without addressing the existing marriage's problems could be seen as inconsiderate. He's not wrong in feeling disconnected, but the way he's handling it\u2014abruptly pulling away and engaging with another woman\u2014might be where the fault lies. He should be in the wrong for not managing the transition more thoughtfully and for causing his wife emotional harm without prior open discussion.\n"
