My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment call on whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. Let me break down the key points from the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is married for almost 20 years, has two kids. They mention being together because both were lonely and afraid of being alone. The marriage might have been based more on fear than genuine connection. He later experienced depression and got therapy, which helped him understand his emotions better. Now, he doesn't like being touched by his wife and has been pulling away. The shift happened when he developed feelings for a friend who's also around 40, which made him consider ending the marriage. His wife is hurt and wants to know why he's changed and if things can go back to normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author admitted that he wasn't fully committed at the start, driven by fear of being alone. Over the years, emotional disconnection and depression might have contributed to the current situation. Therapy helped him realize his feelings, which is a positive step, but now he's acting on them by pulling away from his wife.\n\nIs it wrong to not want to be touched by your spouse? That's a sensitive area. Intimacy is a big part of marriage, so suddenly withdrawing from physical touch without communication could be hurtful. But the author explains that he felt trapped before and now is being honest about not wanting to fake it anymore. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt and without considering his wife's feelings.\n\nHe mentions having a new emotional connection with another woman. Even though he hasn't acted on it physically, the emotional affair can be damaging. The question is whether developing feelings for someone else justifies pulling away from the spouse. The author is in a conflict between his growing feelings for the friend and his commitment to the marriage.\n\nThe wife is described as devastated. She feels abandoned and confused. The author's actions might be seen as breaking trust and emotional fidelity. Even if the marriage wasn't perfect, he's choosing to emotionally distance himself and pursue another relationship, which can be considered a breach of marital vows.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is going through a personal growth phase, learning to be authentic about his feelings. He's not engaging in physical infidelity yet, but the emotional shift is significant. There's a possibility that his actions are a step towards ending the marriage, which could be necessary if the marriage is no longer fulfilling. But the sudden withdrawal and emotional connection with another person while married might still make him at fault.\n\nI also need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many contexts, emotional and physical fidelity are expected within marriage. The author is emotionally involved with another person, which could be seen as a betrayal even if there's no physical affair. His wife's emotional needs are being neglected, leading to her distress.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to be honest about his feelings, which is important for his well-being. But he might not have handled the situation with enough communication and care towards his wife. The question is whether his actions, though honest, are inconsiderate and hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation, but his emotional connection with another woman and withdrawal from his wife might place him in the wrong. He hasn't addressed the marriage's issues directly but is using his feelings for someone else as a reason to disengage, which isn't fair to his wife. The sudden change without communication could be seen as abandoning the marriage without effort to resolve it. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
