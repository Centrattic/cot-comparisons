My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. Let me read through the situation again to understand it better. \n\nThe author is almost 50, married for almost 20 years to a 46-year-old wife. He says they got together because both were lonely and afraid of being alone. He married her unsure, feeling trapped, but she considers him the best thing in her life. He had a depression with suicidal thoughts, which he got help for through therapy. Now, he doesn't like being with his wife anymore; touching her makes him feel hollow and trapped. But he's also been terrified of ending the marriage. Recently, he developed feelings for a female friend (40, attractive, smart). They've met a few times, including once alone. Since then, he's stopped responding to his wife's touches and says no, causing her devastation.\n\nHe's conflicted between not wanting to go back to the previous state and not wanting to end the marriage over a \"passing crush.\" He feels the change isn't temporary but rather him being honest now.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, is it wrong to not want to be in a marriage? If the marriage was already unhappy, maybe there's justification. But he's been in it for 20 years. He married her out of fear of being alone, which might indicate a lack of commitment or emotional readiness. However, staying in a marriage without feeling affection could be seen as unfair to his wife. The wife has been supportive, referring to him as the best thing to ever happen to her. If he's no longer emotionally connected, perhaps he has a responsibility to address the marriage's future, rather than just pulling away suddenly. \n\nBut then, he's developed feelings for another woman. That complicates things. If he's starting to form an emotional connection with someone else, especially while still married, it's generally considered wrong to act on those feelings without addressing the current relationship. However, the main issue here is not acting on the feelings but the withdrawal of affection from his wife. The fact that he's been in therapy and realized his emotions could mean he's not in the wrong for understanding his feelings now. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a marriage, both partners have unmet needs. If he's not meeting his wife's emotional and physical needs, that's a problem. The wife might be suffering from this sudden coldness. He's not being honest about his feelings, or maybe he is, but the way he's handling it is causing her pain. The key here is communication. If he's not hiding his feelings anymore, does that mean he's talking to her about the deeper issues in the marriage, or is he just pulling away without giving her a chance to address it? The situation suggests he's been avoiding the issue for years and is now suddenly withdrawing, which can be hurtful and unfair, even if he's not acting on the new relationship. \n\nAlso, the presence of two kids adds complexity. Ending the marriage could affect them. But if the marriage is already emotionally strained, maybe the kids are already affected. The author might be choosing between two difficult options: staying in an unhappy marriage or ending it. But the act of suddenly pulling away from physical affection without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHe's in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong? Well, not wanting to touch someone in a marriage is a personal issue, but it's also part of a committed relationship. If he's made a conscious decision to end the marriage, he should handle it with care and honesty. But he's not sure if it's a passing crush. The problem is that he's not being emotionally present for his wife, and the sudden change without explanation might be causing more harm. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest with himself now, which is positive. On the other hand, he hasn't communicated his needs and feelings to his wife in a constructive way. Maybe he should explore whether the marriage can be salvved rather than just cutting off contact. If he can't see a way forward and the connection is non-existent, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. But the way he's handling it, especially with the new feelings, might be seen as using the crush as an excuse to escape a difficult situation. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). He's causing his wife emotional distress by suddenly pulling away without addressing the underlying issues in their marriage. Even if he's unhappy, the way he's handling it is abrupt and doesn't consider his wife's feelings. The presence of a new attraction might be a trigger, but the core problem is the lack of emotional connection over years. He should work on communication and possibly seek couples therapy before making a decision. If he can't or won't, and is using the new feelings as a justification, then he's at fault for not handling the situation responsibly.\n"
