My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term marriage where the husband has been unhappy for years, felt trapped, and now is pulling away from physical affection after developing feelings for another woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband married out of fear of being alone, which suggests the marriage wasn't based on mutual happiness from the start. He experienced depression and only sought help later. Now, he's found emotional connection with someone else, leading him to distance himself from his wife. The wife is hurt and doesn't understand the sudden change. \n\nThe husband is conflicted between his feelings for the new woman and the fear of ending a 20-year marriage. He's not wanting to go back to the previous state where he felt empty. The question is whether his actions are justified or if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, emotional infidelity or acting on it could be seen as wrong. However, the context here is that the marriage may have been lacking emotional connection for a long time. The husband's depression and lack of emotional investment might indicate a broken marriage. But he's now acting on his feelings, which could hurt his wife even more. \n\nOn the other hand, staying in an unhappy marriage with no emotional satisfaction can also be harmful. If the husband's depression and emptiness haven't been addressed, continuing the marriage might not be healthy for either party. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without open communication\u2014could be hurtful. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She considers him the best thing in her life, so his sudden withdrawal is a major emotional blow. The husband needs to address this not just through physical distance but through honest communication about his feelings, possibly seeking counseling. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for his emotional involvement or the sudden change in behavior. If he's not acting unethically (like having an affair), but is instead seeking a way out of an unhappy marriage, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the way he's handling the situation is neglecting his wife's needs without proper communication, that could be problematic. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require effort from both sides. If the husband has been unhappy for years and now is seeking personal happiness, it's not entirely his fault. But he's also creating a situation where the wife is left in emotional pain. The answer might hinge on the balance between personal well-being and marital responsibility. \n\nConsidering all factors, the husband's actions stem from years of unaddressed issues and a new emotional connection. While the sudden withdrawal is hurtful, the root issues in the marriage might contribute to his decision. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for communication and possibly professional help to navigate the situation ethically.\n"
