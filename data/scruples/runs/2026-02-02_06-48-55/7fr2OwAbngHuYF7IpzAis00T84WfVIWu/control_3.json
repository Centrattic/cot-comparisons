My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is a 20-year marriage where the husband has been dealing with depression and emotional distance. He's been unresponsive to his wife's physical affection for a long time, but now he's pulling away more after developing feelings for another woman. His wife is upset because he's changed suddenly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband married someone because he was lonely and unsure, which led to a marriage that wasn't emotionally fulfilling. He later developed depression and suicidal thoughts, which he only addressed with therapy. Now, he's feeling a shift in his emotions and is connecting with another woman, leading him to distance himself from his wife. The wife is feeling devastated and confused about his sudden change.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, maintaining a marriage requires mutual effort and communication. The husband has been struggling emotionally for years but only recently started to address it. However, his response to his new feelings might be causing harm to his wife. Even though he's not cheating, pulling away physically and emotionally without clear communication could be seen as neglectful. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of his mental health. He's been through depression and is now trying to be honest about his feelings. The other woman isn't a current threat, but the emotional connection is affecting his relationship. The husband is stuck between his fear of ending the marriage and his desire for a more authentic life.\n\nLegally and socially, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for developing feelings for someone else if he's not acting on them. However, in a marriage, emotional infidelity can be as damaging as physical infidelity. The key issue here is communication. He hasn't explained his feelings to his wife, leading her to feel rejected. If he's considering ending the marriage, he should approach it with honesty and care, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. From a relationship ethics perspective, he has a responsibility to his wife. His withdrawal without proper communication could be harmful. But he also has a right to his own happiness and mental well-being. Since he's not cheating and is seeking to address his issues through therapy, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without explanation\u2014might be the problem. The sudden change and lack of communication could be hurting his wife, which suggests he might be in the wrong in terms of how he's managing the relationship.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if he's in the wrong in the context of not wanting to touch his wife. The physical rejection is part of his emotional state. If he's genuinely not feeling connected to his wife and has been for years, is it wrong to not want physical contact? Maybe not, but he should communicate that to her. The fact that he's been hiding it and suddenly pulling away without explanation is problematic. So perhaps he's not in the wrong for his feelings but is in the wrong for how he's handling the situation. The answer might be nuanced, but since the options are A or B, I have to choose between yes or no. Considering the lack of communication and the impact on his wife, maybe he is in the wrong. But if his feelings are legitimate and he's trying to address them, maybe not. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the crux is communication. Without explaining his feelings, he's not being fair to his wife. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
