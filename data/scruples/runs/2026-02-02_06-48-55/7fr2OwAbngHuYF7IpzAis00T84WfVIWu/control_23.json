My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The scenario is that they've been married almost 20 years, and he's been struggling with emotional issues, depression, and now feels trapped in the relationship. He's developing feelings for a friend, which gives him hope about leaving the marriage. He's stopped touching his wife, which is hurting her, and he's torn between not wanting to end the marriage over a crush but also not wanting to go back to how things were.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he was in a marriage where his heart wasn't in it from the start. He felt trapped, had depression, and now is exploring a potential relationship with someone else. His withdrawal of affection is causing his wife distress, but he feels that the previous situation was also damaging.\n\nMarital relationships are built on mutual respect and emotional support. If one partner is consistently unhappy and it's affecting the relationship, that's a problem. However, cutting off physical contact suddenly and without communication can be harmful. The author is not in the wrong for seeking happiness, but the way he's handling the situation might be. He hasn't communicated his feelings to his wife, which could be a key factor. Also, the fact that he's developing feelings for someone else while still in a marriage is a red flag. It's important to consider whether he's using this new connection as a way to justify leaving without addressing the existing issues in the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is going through therapy and trying to understand his emotions. Maybe his feelings towards his wife have genuinely changed, and the new relationship is a catalyst for him to realize that. However, the sudden change in behavior without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife, who says he's the best thing that ever happened to her, is likely feeling rejected and confused. The author needs to communicate his feelings and work through them with his wife, maybe with the help of couples therapy, before taking any drastic steps like ending the marriage. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his feelings have genuinely changed and the marriage was already strained, he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting a divorce. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without explanation\u2014could be part of the problem. The presence of a new potential relationship might complicate things, as infidelity (even emotionally) is generally frowned upon. So, while his desire for a better situation isn't wrong, his actions (withholding affection without communication and engaging in an emotional affair) could make him at fault.\n\nAlternatively, if the marriage was already emotionally distant and the author is now being honest about his feelings, then he's not in the wrong. The key is whether he's being honest and communicating. The answer depends on the context of how he's approaching the situation. Since he hasn't communicated and is instead acting out, it's possible he's in the wrong. But if the marriage was already failing and he's now being truthful, maybe not. The user is asking for a judgment between A and B, so I need to decide based on typical social norms. The fact that he's emotionally invested in someone else while still married might make him at fault, especially if he's causing his wife emotional harm without addressing it. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But if the marriage was already in trouble and he's now seeking a way out, it's B. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. The act of not wanting to touch her could be part of a larger issue of emotional disconnection. If the marriage was already struggling, maybe it's not his fault. However, if he's now emotionally involved with someone else, that's a problem. The initial answer might lean towards A because withholding affection is harmful and the new relationship complicates things. But maybe the core issue is that he's being honest about his feelings, even if it's painful. So B.\n"
