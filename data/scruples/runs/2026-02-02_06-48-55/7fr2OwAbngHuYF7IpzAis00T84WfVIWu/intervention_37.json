My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The author is married for 20 years, has kids, and is now feeling trapped in the marriage. They mention not liking physical contact with their wife anymore and have developed feelings for a friend. They're pulling away from their wife, causing her distress, but the author feels it's about being honest and not hiding their feelings anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was in a marriage that started with some uncertainty, maybe not fully committed. Then developed depression, got therapy, and now is changing their behavior towards the wife. The wife is described as loving them, but the author is now emotionally attached to someone else. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, being in a committed marriage and developing feelings for someone else might be seen as cheating or at least emotionally unfaithful. But the author hasn't acted on it yet; they're just pulling away from their spouse. However, the sudden change in behavior without communication might be harmful. The author mentions they're scared of ending the marriage but also feel trapped. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be honest about their feelings and not want to stay in a marriage that's making them unhappy. On the other hand, the wife is being hurt by the withdrawal and the author's emotional infidelity. The author isn't directly cheating, but their actions (pulling away and forming a close bond with another woman) could be considered a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they need to take responsibility for their role in the marriage's decline. If they were unhappy for years and only now deciding to change their behavior, it could be seen as selfish. The wife has been supportive, according to the author, so her devastation is a consequence of their decision. \n\nBut the author is also dealing with emotional issues and seeking therapy, which is a positive step. They might be in a difficult situation where their needs are finally being addressed. However, the way they're handling the situation\u2014without open communication with their wife\u2014is problematic. They need to talk to her about their feelings instead of just pulling away, which is causing confusion and pain.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is acting inconsiderately by not addressing the issues with their spouse and instead creating emotional distance. They might be in the wrong if they're not being transparent or giving their wife a chance to work through the problem with them. Emotional infidelity can be as damaging as physical infidelity. Therefore, the author's actions, though stemming from personal struggles, may be harming their wife without proper communication or consideration for her feelings.\n"
