My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband has been in a 20-year marriage, but he's been feeling trapped and distant from his wife for a long time. He mentions not wanting to touch her anymore, which is causing her distress. He's also developing feelings for another woman, which has made him more sure that leaving the marriage might be better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's been unhappy for years, struggled with depression, and now is finally able to express his feelings. He's not having an affair yet, just forming a bond with another woman. He's torn between staying in a marriage that makes him unhappy or ending it. The wife, on the other hand, feels devastated because her husband is pulling away physically and emotionally after 20 years.\n\nMarriage involves mutual effort and communication. If the husband had addressed his feelings earlier, maybe things could have been different. But he's been hiding his true feelings for a long time, which led to his wife not knowing about his emotional state. Now, his sudden change in behavior is causing her pain. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not cheating yet, but the emotional connection with another woman is influencing his decision to leave. However, he's also being honest about his feelings now, which is important. The question is whether he owes his wife more effort to fix the marriage before leaving. \n\nBut the user thinks he's in the wrong, so I should evaluate if that's justified. The husband's actions are causing his wife emotional harm, and maybe he should have tried to work through things instead of pulling away. However, if the marriage was a source of depression and he's only just finding the courage to be honest, perhaps it's not entirely his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, he didn't communicate his needs and now is making abrupt changes without considering his wife's feelings. Marriages require ongoing communication. The fact that he was in therapy and is now making a change could be a positive step towards self-awareness, but the way he's handling it might be hurtful.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's seeking happiness and honesty, but he's also causing pain. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without addressing it openly and considering the impact on his wife\u2014might make him partially responsible. But I'm not sure if he's entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest now and seeking his own well-being, but there are arguments for A as well. Hmm.\n"
