My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's been married for almost 20 years, and he's not wanting to touch his wife anymore. He's been struggling with this for a while but now has a new friend who makes him feel like ending the marriage might be possible. He's pulling away from his wife, and she's devastated. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasons. He mentions being in the marriage out of fear of being alone, then later developed depression. Therapy helped him realize he doesn't want to be with his wife anymore. He's honest about his feelings now, which he previously suppressed. He doesn't want to end the marriage over a \"passing crush\" but feels the change isn't temporary. \n\nOn the other hand, communication is a big part of relationships. Did he talk to his wife about his feelings before pulling away? The post says he didn't tell her about his depression until he got help. Maybe he didn't communicate his needs effectively over the years. Now, by suddenly withdrawing, he's causing her distress. \n\nAlso, the new friendship with an attractive woman might be a red flag. Even if there's no physical affair, emotional involvement could be developing. But he hasn't cheated yet. He's conflicted about ending the marriage. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be in the marriage anymore? If the marriage was unhappy for a long time and he's now being honest, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the way he's handling it\u2014pulling away without discussing it with his wife\u2014could be harmful. \n\nMarriages require mutual effort. If he's realized the marriage isn't working, maybe he should be considering divorce rather than just emotionally withdrawing. But he's also scared of the consequences. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's complicated. He's being honest about his feelings after years of suppression, which is good. But he's also not considering his wife's feelings and the impact of his actions. He might need to have a more open conversation with her instead of just pulling away. So maybe he's partly at fault for not handling it better, but not entirely. But according to the options, it's A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's being honest about his feelings, even if it's painful for his wife, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he's acting without communication could be wrong. The answer might be B, no, because he's finally being truthful, even if it's hard. Alternatively, A if he should have addressed it differently. But the main issue is whether his actions are wrong. Since he's not cheating yet and is trying to be honest, maybe the answer is B.\n"
