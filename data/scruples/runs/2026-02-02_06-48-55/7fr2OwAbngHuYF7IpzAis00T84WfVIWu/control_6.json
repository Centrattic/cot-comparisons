My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who's been married for 20 years, has two kids, and is struggling with not wanting to be touched by his wife. He's been dealing with depression and only recently found some emotional clarity through therapy. Now, he's been connecting with a female friend who's around his wife's age, and this has made him realize he doesn't want to stay in the marriage. However, when his wife tries to touch him or wants physical contact, he's pulling away, which has hurt her. He's conflicted about whether he's doing the right thing by not going back to how things were.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional dynamics here. The man married his wife out of fear of being alone, which might have contributed to an unhappy marriage. He's been suppressing his feelings for a long time, leading to depression. Therapy helped him start acknowledging these feelings. Now, the new friendship with an attractive woman seems to have given him hope for a different life, but he's worried about hurting his wife and ending a long-term marriage over a \"passing crush.\"\n\nOn one hand, he's been in an unhappy marriage for years, and now he's being honest about his feelings. On the other hand, he has a family, and walking away might seem like a betrayal. His wife feels devastated, and he's avoiding her touch, which is a form of emotional withdrawal. But is that his fault? He's been in a marriage where he felt trapped and only recently found the strength to change. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to continue in a relationship that's been emotionally draining for him.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. In many cultures, staying married for the kids is expected, but the man's mental health is a significant factor here. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pulling away without communication\u2014might be harmful. The key points are his emotional state, the history of the marriage, and the sudden change in behavior due to a new relationship. The woman he's connecting with might be complicating things, but the root issue is his dissatisfaction in the marriage.\n\nIs he in the wrong for not wanting to be in a marriage he's unhappy in? Or is he in the wrong for potentially ruining a 20-year relationship? The answer might depend on whether he's being honest and taking responsibility. He's not in the wrong for wanting to be happy, but he should handle the situation with care. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the details, since his actions stem from a long-term unhappiness and he's trying to find his own happiness after therapy, it's more about his right to pursue his well-being. But the way he's handling it (pulling away without clear communication) might be part of the problem. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So, the answer might be B (no), as he's not in the wrong for seeking his own happiness after years of being trapped, even if it's painful for others.\n"
