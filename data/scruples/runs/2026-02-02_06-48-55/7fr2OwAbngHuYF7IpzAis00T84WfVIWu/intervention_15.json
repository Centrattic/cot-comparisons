My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user presented a scenario where a husband has been married for 20 years but now doesn't want physical contact with his wife. He's been dealing with depression, got therapy, and now feels a change after connecting with another woman. His wife is upset because he's pulling away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they married when they were both lonely and unsure. He felt trapped and wasn't in love. Over time, he developed depression and sought help. Now, he's realizing he doesn't want to be in the marriage anymore, leading to emotional distance. The key points here are the lack of emotional connection, the impact of depression, and the new feelings towards another woman.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to touch his wife. From a relationship perspective, if there's a lack of consent or communication, that could be an issue. However, the author has been in therapy, processing his emotions, and is being honest about his feelings now. He's not engaging in physical contact because it makes him feel trapped, which might indicate a deeper issue in the marriage that wasn't addressed before. \n\nOn the other hand, his wife feels devastated and is asking for clarity. The sudden change might be confusing for her, but the author is finally being honest about his long-standing feelings. The problem isn't just about physical touch but the overall dissatisfaction in the marriage. The author isn't cheating, but the emotional shift is causing strain. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author is just being truthful about his feelings now that he's had time to process them. It's possible that the marriage had underlying issues, and the author is taking responsibility for his part. However, he's also not addressing his wife's needs properly, which could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the marriage was unhappy for a long time, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier. But given his past depression and fear of ending the marriage, it's understandable he was avoiding conflict. Now that he's in a better place mentally, he's finally expressing his true feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's being honest now, which is positive, but the way he's pulling away without sufficient communication or effort to salvage the relationship could be problematic. However, considering the history of his depression and the lack of emotional connection, it might not be entirely his fault. The answer could go either way, but the user is leaning towards A. But I need to think if there's a right or wrong here. In relationships, both partners have responsibilities. If the author was unhappy for years and didn't address it, that's part of the problem. But the wife might not have supported him adequately either. Given the complexity, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he's contributing to the breakdown after years of unaddressed issues, but the other woman complicates things. Wait, the author isn't cheating; he's just connecting emotionally. So maybe the fault isn't entirely his. Hmm. I'm really torn here. The question is about not wanting to touch his wife. If he's been struggling with that for a long time and it's a result of their marriage's issues, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's been avoiding communication and now suddenly pulling away without considering her feelings, that could be his fault. I think the key is whether he's being honest about his feelings. If he's been in therapy and is now acting on self-awareness, maybe it's not wrong. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the user thinks A. I need to make sure. The user's initial thought is A, but maybe the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's finally being honest about his feelings and the marriage might have been unhappy for a long time. However, the way he's handling it could be improved. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about how to handle it. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
