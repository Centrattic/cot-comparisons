My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The husband is married for 20 years, had a marriage that started out of loneliness, and now he's not feeling connected to his wife, especially when she touches him. He's been in therapy for depression and now has feelings for a friend. He's pulling away from his wife physically, which upsets her. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's reasons: he's been unhappy for a long time, felt trapped, and now has a new emotional connection. But he's also been avoiding addressing the issues in his marriage for years. He didn't communicate his feelings to his wife before, only after finding someone else. His actions now are causing his wife distress, and he's not being open about his feelings. Instead of having a conversation about his needs and the state of the marriage, he's acting out by pulling away, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's going through a transformation with therapy, learning to express his true feelings. He wasn't in a healthy place before and is now seeking a more authentic connection. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt. Leaving a marriage isn't something to do on a whim, especially if there are kids involved. But he's not necessarily cheating; he's just emotionally connecting with someone else and realizing his own needs.\n\nBut the key point is communication. He hasn't told his wife about his feelings or the reasons for his change in behavior. He's acting out by pulling away, which is a form of emotional withdrawal. In a marriage, especially one as long as 20 years, both partners have responsibilities to each other. Withholding affection without explanation can be damaging. His wife is devastated and doesn't understand why he's changing. He should have had an honest conversation about his feelings instead of silently withdrawing. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's using the presence of another person as a catalyst to consider ending the marriage might complicate things. Even if his feelings for the other woman are genuine, it's important to handle the existing relationship responsibly. The question is whether his actions are justified. While he's not at fault for having feelings, how he's handling the situation\u2014without transparency and communication\u2014might make him at fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for seeking authenticity and emotional health, but his approach could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the focus is on his behavior towards his wife, then his lack of communication and sudden withdrawal without explanation could be seen as the problem. Hence, maybe he is in the wrong for not addressing things properly.\n"
