My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the man is married, has been for 20 years, and he's been feeling trapped and disconnected for a long time. He went through depression and therapy, and now he's finding some connection with a friend who's a woman. He's pulling away from his wife physically and emotionally, causing her distress. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man married young, possibly out of fear of being alone. He wasn't emotionally invested at the start and later developed depression. Therapy helped him become more self-aware, which led him to realize he doesn't want to be in the marriage anymore. However, he's been avoiding this realization for years by just enduring it. Now, with a new potential interest, he's acting on his feelings, which upsets his wife.\n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings now that he's more self-aware. He's not in a healthy place emotionally and might need to address the long-term viability of the marriage. On the other hand, he's been married a long time, has kids, and his sudden withdrawal could be hurting his wife. The fact that he's been hiding his feelings for so long and now is acting on them without much communication might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to live authentically after years of suppression. However, he's not considering his wife's perspective. He's not in a relationship where both parties are emotionally satisfied. The problem is that his actions are causing her pain now. Maybe he should have addressed this earlier instead of waiting until he found someone else. The fact that he's not initiating a breakup but is just pulling away might be unfair because it's confusing for his wife. He's also not taking responsibility for the long-term consequences of his decisions on their family.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think there's a mix. He's not wrong for wanting to be honest, but he's wrong in how he's handling the transition. He should have approached this with more communication and consideration for his wife's feelings from the start. The sudden change and the secrecy around his new interest could be damaging. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's contributing to the marital distress without proper communication and is acting on a new relationship which might not be the right time to make such a decision.\n"
