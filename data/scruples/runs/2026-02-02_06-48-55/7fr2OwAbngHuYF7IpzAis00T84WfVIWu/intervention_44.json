My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The person is married for 20 years, has two kids, and has been dealing with emotional issues. They married out of fear of being alone, which didn't go well, leading to depression. Now they're not into physical intimacy with their wife and have developed feelings for another woman. They've become distant, pulling away from their wife, which is hurting her.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they feel trapped in the marriage, have been struggling emotionally, and now see a potential for happiness with someone else. They don't want to go back to how things were, but also don't want to end the marriage over a \"crush.\" However, their actions (pulling away from their wife) are causing her pain.\n\nBut here's the thing: marriage requires commitment. Even if the marriage started on shaky grounds, the author is now choosing to act on feelings for someone else instead of working through the issues. They have kids involved, so breaking up would affect them too. The author is prioritizing their own needs without considering the impact on others, maybe not maliciously, but still causing harm. They might not be in love now, but walking away might not be the right solution. They should address the root causes of their feelings of emptiness rather than just reacting to a new attraction. Also, being honest with their wife about their feelings, even if it's uncomfortable, might be necessary instead of withdrawing. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling this more thoughtfully and for acting on infidelity-like behavior without trying to resolve the marriage first. But maybe there's also some validity to their emotional struggle. Hmm. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer could depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, in a committed marriage, one partner shouldn't pull away without communication and effort to fix the relationship. They might be in the wrong for not engaging in that process.\n"
