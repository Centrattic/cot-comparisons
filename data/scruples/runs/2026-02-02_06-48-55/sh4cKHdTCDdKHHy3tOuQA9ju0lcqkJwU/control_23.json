We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who recently found out she's pregnant. Her husband, who's newly graduated in computer science, works at a startup he doesn't really like. He wanted to quit his job after his boss suggested he find a new one. They had discussed strategies\u2014applying for other jobs while keeping his current one, and if that didn't work, applying during paternity leave. But the husband ends up quitting suddenly without following through on their plan, and the wife is upset, especially because she's pregnant with complications and worried about the financial stability and his job prospects if he takes a long paternity leave.\n\nFirst, let me consider the wife's perspective. She's trying to balance her husband's career with the practical aspects of their family situation. She's concerned about financial stability, especially during her pregnancy, which has existing medical risks. Her arguments are that he needs to gain experience, that quitting might lead to him taking a job he doesn't like again, and that the timing is bad with her pregnancy. She felt supported his job search but didn't support quitting immediately. She's worried about how employers might view the paternity leave during job applications. Her stance seems to be about long-term planning and stability.\n\nThen the husband's perspective: He's unhappy in his current job, which he feels is not providing quality work experience. His boss encouraged him to leave. He might feel that staying in a job he dislikes is not good for his career development. He might believe that quitting now is better for his professional growth, even if there's short-term instability. He might feel that his wife isn't supportive of his personal needs and aspirations. He could see his job as a dead-end and want to make a change before the baby arrives, even if it's risky.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is the asshole here. The key points are: Did she have a valid reason to oppose quitting? Was her concern about financial stability and job search timing reasonable? Did the husband overstep by not following their agreed-upon plan?\n\nThe wife had significant health risks during pregnancy, which adds to the stress and potential complications. Financial stability is a big concern during pregnancy and early parenthood. Her argument that he needs to gain experience makes sense in his field, especially if he wants a better job. Also, the risk of employers not wanting to hire someone who needs paternity leave soon is a real issue, especially in countries with strict leave policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's frustration with his job and desire to pursue better opportunities is understandable. However, he did not adhere to the plan they had discussed, which included looking for jobs while employed. Quitting without securing another job could create financial strain, which is a valid concern for the wife. The fact that he went against their agreement and didn't consider the additional stress this could cause her during a high-risk pregnancy might mean he didn't fully consider her perspective.\n\nThe husband's reaction to her concerns by saying she doesn't support him and telling her to stop talking is dismissive and disrespectful. The wife's anger is justified because they had a plan, and he broke it, which could endanger their financial situation. She had valid medical and practical reasons to oppose quitting. His decision might have been impulsive, ignoring the risks they discussed.\n\nIn terms of support, support in a relationship often means considering each other's valid concerns. The wife is supporting his job search by advising to look while employed, but he dismissed that. The husband's decision to quit without a plan could be seen as not considering her valid fears, especially given the pregnancy complications. Therefore, the husband might be at fault here for not following their agreement and not respecting her concerns. The wife's reaction, while maybe harsh, is from a place of genuine worry about their financial and health situation.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The husband made a decision that disregarded their prior agreement and her significant concerns during a vulnerable time. Her stance is about financial stability and practicality, which are valid in their situation.\n"
