We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband quits his job without discussing it properly, even after they had agreed on a plan to look for new jobs while he's still employed. The author (the wife) is pregnant with several health complications, which adds stress and financial uncertainty.\n\nFirst, the husband's job situation: he's in a startup where he's not happy, and they're patching code instead of fixing it. He wanted to quit after talking to his boss, who suggested he find a new job. The wife was worried because of her pregnancy and the potential financial strain if he took a long paternity leave. They had a plan where he would keep his job while looking for new positions. But he went ahead and quit without following through on the plan.\n\nThe wife's concerns are valid. She's already dealing with health issues during pregnancy, which could complicate things financially if he loses his job. Also, in Scandinavia, paternity leave is long, so if he were to take that, it might be hard for him to find another job quickly. The husband didn't stick to their agreement and made a unilateral decision, which upset her. She felt unsupported and betrayed, leading to the argument.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he wanted to leave a job he dislikes, and his boss encouraged him to quit. He might feel that staying in a job he's unhappy in isn't sustainable long-term. But he didn't follow through with the compromise they had discussed, which was to look for jobs while still employed. His actions disregarded her concerns and the financial stability they needed during her pregnancy.\n\nLooking at the arguments, the key points are communication and compromise. They had a plan, but he went against it. The wife's priority is the family's financial security during a vulnerable time, which is understandable. The husband's priority is his job satisfaction, but he didn't manage it in a way that considered the current situation. The question is whether the wife was wrong for not supporting his decision. Since she had valid reasons and they had a prior agreement, it seems her stance is justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
