We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband quits his job without following through on the agreed-upon plan, despite the wife's concerns about her pregnancy and health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is pregnant with high-risk complications: gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia risk, and had a CVS procedure. The husband wanted to quit his job because he's unhappy there, but they had discussed a plan where he would look for jobs while still employed. The boss had already suggested he find a new job, and the husband was supposed to talk to the boss today. Instead, he quit without discussing it with her first, leading to conflict.\n\nThe wife's main arguments are about financial stability and the risks of him quitting, especially with her health issues. She's worried about finding a new job quickly, especially considering paternity leave. The husband felt unsupported and that she wasn't backing his decision. \n\nNow, considering the context: The wife has valid concerns about their financial situation and her health. The husband did agree to a plan but went against it. The wife's reaction, while strong, seems to stem from genuine worries. The husband's action of quitting without discussion could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. \n\nIn terms of support in a relationship, mutual agreement is important. The husband didn't stick to the plan they had made, which could make the wife feel disrespected. However, the husband might feel frustrated if he feels his career needs are being overlooked. But given the wife's health risks and the financial implications, her stance is understandable. \n\nIs the author (the wife) in the wrong? She expressed her concerns, tried to find solutions, and the husband didn't follow through. Her anger is a reaction to broken trust. The husband's actions disregarded their prior agreement. So, probably the husband is at fault here. The wife isn't being irrational; her concerns are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
