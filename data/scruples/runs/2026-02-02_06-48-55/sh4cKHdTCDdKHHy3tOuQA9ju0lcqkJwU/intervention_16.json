We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's husband quit his job without following through on the agreed-upon plan, even though the author was pregnant with several health concerns. The author is upset because she wanted him to keep his job while looking for new opportunities to ensure financial stability and avoid the risks of quitting during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband felt compelled to quit after his boss suggested he find a new job, and he might have felt it was the right time given the startup's issues. However, the author had valid concerns about the financial implications, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. They had discussed a plan where he would look for jobs while employed, and possibly during paternity leave if needed. By quitting unilaterally, he disregarded their plan and her health considerations.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband's decision to quit without following the agreed steps might seem impulsive from the author's perspective. She's handling a complicated pregnancy and was relying on their plan to manage stress and financial security. On the other hand, the husband might feel that staying in a job he doesn't like is not sustainable in the long term. However, the timing and lack of consideration for her situation could make his actions seem self-centered.\n\nThe author's reaction, while strong, comes from a place of concern for both her health and their family's stability. She's not being unreasonable; her worries are based on real health risks and financial uncertainty. The husband's decision to quit despite their prior agreement might undermine her efforts to plan for their future together.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the husband did not stick to the plan they had discussed, which prioritized the author's health and financial stability. His actions could be seen as not supporting her needs during a vulnerable time, even if his intentions were to pursue a better career path. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
