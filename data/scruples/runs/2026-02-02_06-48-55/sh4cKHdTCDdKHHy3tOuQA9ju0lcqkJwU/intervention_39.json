We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband quits his job without following through on the agreed-upon plan, despite the wife's concerns about her pregnancy and the financial implications. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband wanted to quit his job because he's unhappy there, and the boss encouraged him to leave. The wife was worried about the financial stability, especially since she's pregnant and has health risks. They had discussed a plan where he would keep his job while looking for new opportunities, and if that didn't work, he could look during paternity leave. However, he decided to quit without following through on the plan they had discussed.\n\nThe wife is upset because he didn't stick to their agreement and is now accusing her of not supporting him. The husband feels unsupported and that she's not backing his career decisions. \n\nFrom the information given, the wife had valid concerns about the health risks and the potential instability of the husband quitting. They had a plan that balanced his career goals with their family's needs. By quitting abruptly, the husband didn't consider the agreed-upon steps, which could exacerbate the wife's stress and financial worries during her pregnancy. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. They had a discussion and came up with a compromise. The husband breaking that agreement without discussing it further might be seen as disregarding her concerns. The wife's support was conditional on following the plan they set together. His actions could be seen as not respecting that agreement, which makes the wife's reaction understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel his career is important and that he's making a necessary change. However, in a situation where the wife is in a vulnerable health state, the husband should prioritize her well-being and the family's stability. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the husband's decision to quit without following their plan could be seen as not being supportive of his wife's health and the family's needs. Therefore, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong for not supporting the sudden job quitting, especially since they had a prior agreement. Hence, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
