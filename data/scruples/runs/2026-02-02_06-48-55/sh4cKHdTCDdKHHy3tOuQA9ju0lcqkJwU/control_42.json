We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the husband wanting to quit his job while the wife is pregnant with several health complications. The wife is in her 14th week of pregnancy and has conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. The husband's job is a startup that doesn't offer a great work environment, and he's considering quitting after discussing alternatives with the wife.\n\nFirst, the husband had previously talked to his boss about a raise, but the boss suggested he look elsewhere. The couple had agreed on a plan where he would look for jobs while still employed or during paternity leave. But then he decided to quit without following through on that plan. The wife is upset because she's concerned about the financial stability, especially given her health issues, and the potential difficulty in finding a new job quickly. The husband feels unsupported and the wife feels betrayed.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The key points here are the wife's concerns about financial security during a high-risk pregnancy and the husband's decision to quit without following the agreed-upon plan. In terms of responsibilities, when a spouse is pregnant with complications, financial stability is a significant factor. The husband's actions might jeopardize that stability, and the wife's reaction is based on valid concerns for both her health and the baby's.\n\nHowever, the husband's perspective is that he's trying to find a job that he's passionate about and that the current job is not fulfilling. But he didn't stick to the compromise they had discussed. The wife is trying to balance his career goals with the immediate family needs. In many cases, supporting a partner's career is important, but when there are significant health risks, the priority shifts to ensuring stability. The husband didn't communicate his decision properly and went against their previous agreement, which the wife had a right to expect he would follow.\n\nConsidering all this, the wife's concerns are valid and she's not wrong for not supporting an impulsive decision that could lead to financial instability during a vulnerable time. The husband's actions were self-centered, ignoring the agreed plan and the wife's health issues. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
