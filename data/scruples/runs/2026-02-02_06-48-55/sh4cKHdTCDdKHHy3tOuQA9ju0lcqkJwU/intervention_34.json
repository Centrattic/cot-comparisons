We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband quits his job despite discussing alternative plans when the wife is pregnant with multiple health complications. The wife argues that quitting now is risky because he might not find another job quickly, especially with paternity leave coming up, and they need financial stability. The husband felt unsupported and unappreciated when his wife didn't back his decision to quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's main concerns are the family's financial security and her own health issues. Pregnancies with complications like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia can be risky, so having a stable income is crucial. She had valid points about needing to work while he looks for a new job instead of quitting abruptly. The husband, on the other hand, felt that his career was being stifled and wanted to move on, even if it meant a risk. He might feel that staying in a job he dislikes is also not ideal for his long-term happiness.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. They had discussed a plan where he would look for jobs while still employed. When the husband decides to quit without following through on that plan, it shows he didn't stick to their agreement. The wife's reaction is based on the agreed-upon strategy, which the husband ignored. This could be seen as him not respecting their prior discussion, leading to her feeling she's in the right to be upset.\n\nHowever, the husband might argue that his boss encouraged him to leave and that he's following his own career path. But given the circumstances of the wife's health and pregnancy, the husband's decision could be seen as selfish or not considering the family's financial stability. The wife's stance is about practicality and safety, which is a common concern in such situations. The husband's actions might be impulsive, not considering the agreed plan and the wife's health issues.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's decisions while considering the family's well-being is important. The husband's decision to quit without following their agreed steps could be seen as not supporting the family's best interests. The wife's support would mean adhering to the plan they discussed, ensuring financial security during her pregnancy. The husband's reaction to her concerns as her being un-supportive is a mischaracterization; her support is conditional on maintaining stability.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. Her concerns are valid and based on the family's needs. The husband is the one who didn't follow through on their agreement and took a risky step without considering their prior discussion. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
