We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user is a woman who's pregnant and her husband just quit his job without following through on the agreed-upon plan. They had discussed options like applying for new jobs while still employed or during paternity leave. The husband's job is at a startup where he's not happy, but he's new to the field with no experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in a vulnerable state due to her pregnancy complications like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. She's worried about the financial stability of their family, especially since she was already concerned about him needing to take a long paternity leave. The husband's decision to quit might leave them without immediate income, which adds stress during a time when she's already dealing with health issues.\n\nThe husband's reasons for quitting: the boss suggested he find a new job, and maybe the company isn't treating him well. But they had a plan to look for jobs while he was still working. He didn't stick to that plan, which the user saw as irresponsible. The user is emphasizing the importance of stability and long-term planning, especially given her current medical conditions. Her reaction was to express disgust, which might come off as harsh, but the question is whether she was wrong to not support his quitting.\n\nIn terms of support, it's about mutual consideration. The husband feels he needs to pursue his career goals, but the user is prioritizing their family's immediate financial needs. The key points are communication and considering each other's perspectives. The husband didn't communicate his decision properly and went against their agreement. The user's concerns are valid because sudden job loss can have serious consequences, especially with a high-risk pregnancy. However, her reaction might be seen as extreme. The husband's approach might be impulsive, not thinking through the financial implications for his wife's situation. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, she had valid reasons to oppose the immediate quit. Her health risks and the family's financial stability are real. The husband could have waited until after the baby is born or found a way to look for jobs while still employed. By quitting, he's creating a situation that's risky for the family. Therefore, the user isn't wrong for not supporting an impulsive decision that could jeopardize their financial security during a critical time. The husband should have considered her concerns more carefully and honored the plan they made together. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
