We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband quitting his job despite discussions with his wife, who is pregnant and has health complications.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife (the author) is concerned about the financial stability because she's pregnant and has medical issues. She was against quitting because they had planned for him to keep his job while looking for new opportunities. She mentioned that if he quits, he might not find a good job quickly, especially with the need for paternity leave. She also points out that they had agreed on two options which he wasn't following. \n\nThe husband, on the other hand, felt unsupported and decided to quit anyway. He might feel that his career needs are important and that he shouldn't be stuck in a job he dislikes. But he did ignore their prior agreement and the wife's valid concerns about their financial situation and her health. \n\nIn terms of responsibilities, when one partner is in a vulnerable position (like pregnancy with complications), the other partner is expected to consider those factors. The husband's decision could lead to financial instability, which is a significant stressor, especially during pregnancy. The wife's concerns are practical and about securing their family's well-being. \n\nHowever, the husband might feel that his career is also important and he deserves to be happy. But he did unilaterally make a decision without respecting the agreed-upon plan, which caused conflict. \n\nIn many cases, financial stability is a priority when there are health risks involved. The wife's approach seems cautious and responsible, trying to balance both career growth and immediate financial needs. The husband's action of quitting without considering the consequences could be seen as selfish or not considering the family's situation. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of supporting each other's goals. The husband might feel that his career dissatisfaction is valid and needs addressing. However, the timing, given the wife's pregnancy and medical issues, complicates things. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the wife's concerns are valid and she's trying to protect the family's financial health during a critical time. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which shows a lack of consideration for her position. Therefore, the husband's actions are more in the wrong here. The author isn't in the wrong because she's acting in the family's best interest and had legitimate reasons to oppose the quit. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
