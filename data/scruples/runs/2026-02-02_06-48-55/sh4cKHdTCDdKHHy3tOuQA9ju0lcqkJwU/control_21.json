We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a husband quitting his job without following through on the agreed-upon plan, while the wife is pregnant with complications.\n\nFirst, the husband wanted to quit because he's unhappy with his job. The wife advised him to stay and gain experience, which she did for her own career. They discussed a plan where he would look for new jobs while keeping his current one. Then, after returning from their honeymoon and with the wife pregnant, the husband decides to quit despite their plan. The wife is worried about financial stability and the challenges of finding a new job during her pregnancy and potential complications.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The wife felt they had a plan, and the husband went against their agreement without discussing it first. The husband might feel his career needs attention, but the wife's concerns about the baby's health and financial security are valid. \n\nI think the husband made a unilateral decision without respecting the plan they had discussed, which could be seen as dismissive of her valid worries. The wife's reaction is about protecting their family's stability during a vulnerable time. So, the husband might be in the wrong here for not following through on their agreement. But the wife's anger and saying she's disgusted might have been harsh. However, given the circumstances, her concerns are legitimate. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
