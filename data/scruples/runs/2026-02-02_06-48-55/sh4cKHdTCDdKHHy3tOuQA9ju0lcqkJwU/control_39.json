We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong after her husband quit his job despite their discussion about alternatives, especially since she's pregnant with several health concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband wanted to quit his job because he didn't like it, but the author was worried about the financial stability and the timing due to her pregnancy. They had agreed that he would look for new jobs while keeping his current one, and if that didn't work, during paternity leave. However, he went ahead and quit without following their plan.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels he didn't consider the risks, like not finding a new job quickly and the financial strain during her pregnancy. The husband feels unsupported and that his career needs weren't respected. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, she's in a vulnerable state with a high-risk pregnancy. Her concerns about financial security and stress are valid. She had valid reasons to want him to stay employed. The husband, on the other hand, might feel he's making a necessary step for his career, but he didn't stick to the plan they had both agreed on.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consideration of each other's circumstances. The author expressed her worries and they had a plan, but he went against it. Even if his intentions were to find a better job, he didn't take her situation into account when making the decision. Quitting a job is a big step, especially when there are dependents with health issues. \n\nIn relationships, support means considering each other's needs. The author's main issue is that he didn't follow through with their agreement, which shows a lack of support for her situation. The husband's action could be seen as self-centered in this context. \n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he felt pressured to make a career move and that the boss was encouraging him to leave. But even so, he should have discussed it with his wife first, especially given the circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she prioritized their family's stability and safety. The husband made a unilateral decision that disregarded their agreement and her health concerns. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
