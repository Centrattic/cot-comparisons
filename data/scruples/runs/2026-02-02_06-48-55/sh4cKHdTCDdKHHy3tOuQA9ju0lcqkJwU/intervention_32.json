We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband quitting his job without following through on their discussed plan, while the wife is pregnant with several health complications.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband got a job after his degree but is unhappy with it. The wife advised him to gain experience first, which he didn't do. They had agreed on a plan where he would look for other jobs while still employed. However, the husband quits suddenly, which upsets the wife because of her pregnancy risks and financial stability. The wife is worried about finding another job quickly, especially if he needs to take paternity leave. The husband feels unsupported and that she isn't backing his career decision.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication breakdown and differing priorities. The wife's concerns are valid given her health risks and the financial implications of a potential job gap. The husband, on the other hand, might feel his career satisfaction is important and that he's being hindered by the current job. But he didn't stick to the agreed plan, which the wife had concerns about. \n\nThe wife's main argument is about supporting their family's stability, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. The husband's decision to quit without following the discussed steps could be seen as disregarding her valid concerns. However, the husband might feel that staying in a job he dislikes is also harmful in the long run. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband did unilaterally make a decision after they had already discussed alternatives. The wife's reaction is based on her specific circumstances. It's a conflict between immediate practical concerns versus long-term career goals. But since the husband didn't follow the agreed strategy, the wife's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong because she had legitimate reasons to be concerned about their financial stability and her health. The husband's decision to quit without adhering to their plan shows a lack of consideration for her perspective, even if his own career dissatisfaction is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
