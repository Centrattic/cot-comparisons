We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not supporting her husband quitting his job while she's pregnant with several health complications. \n\nFirst, the husband got a job after graduating with a BSc in CS. He's unhappy with his current job, which he feels is just patching code and not addressing the root issues. The wife advised him to gain experience first, which makes sense in their field where a PhD is often needed for good jobs. She suggested looking for other jobs while staying employed. He had reasons not to apply\u2014like their upcoming wedding trip and needing to work on his portfolio. They came up with a plan where he would apply while working, and if not, during paternity leave.\n\nThen, when he tried to talk to his boss about a raise, the boss suggested he find a new job. The husband wanted to quit, but the wife was concerned because she's pregnant with high-risk conditions. She worried about financial stability and the difficulty of finding a job during his paternity leave. They agreed on a plan for him to apply while still employed. However, he quit without following through on their plan, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health risks and the financial implications. She's not just dealing with a normal pregnancy; she has gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia risks, and needed a CVS. This suggests a higher level of stress and potential complications. Her concerns about financial security are valid, especially if he needs to take a long paternity leave. The husband, while wanting to pursue his career, acted against their agreed plan, which could exacerbate her stress and financial uncertainty.\n\nThe husband's argument is about supporting his career, but the wife's priorities are health and stability. The question is whether her stance is unreasonable. Given the circumstances, she's trying to balance his career goals with the immediate needs of their family situation. His decision to quit without considering the agreed plan might not be supportive of her health and financial concerns. So, the answer would be that the author (wife) is not in the wrong because her concerns are valid and she was trying to protect both their well-being. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
