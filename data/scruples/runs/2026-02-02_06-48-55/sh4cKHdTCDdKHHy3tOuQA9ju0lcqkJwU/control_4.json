We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not supporting her husband's decision to quit his job while she's pregnant. \n\nFirst, the husband works at a startup he dislikes. He's new to the field with no experience. The wife advises him to stay and gain experience because that's how it works in her field (needing a PhD). But she's also pushing him to apply elsewhere while still employed. He gives reasons for not applying, like their wedding trip and needing to work on his portfolio. After coming back from their honeymoon, she finds out she's pregnant and has several health risks. The husband then tries to get a raise but is told to quit instead. They agree on a plan where he keeps his job while looking for new opportunities. But he quits anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nThe wife's main concerns are financial stability and the risks of him quitting, especially with her pregnancy complications. She's worried about his job security if he takes paternity leave and the stress on her health. The husband feels unsupported by her for not backing his decision to leave a job he's unhappy in.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The wife's stance seems practical, considering their current situation. She's trying to ensure stability for their family, especially with her health risks. The husband's decision to quit might be impulsive, not following their agreed-upon plan. Support in a relationship usually means considering each other's well-being. The wife is acting in the interest of their family's stability, while the husband is prioritizing his job satisfaction. But the husband's argument is that he shouldn't be forced to stay in a job he hates. \n\nHowever, the key points are the wife's valid medical concerns and the agreed plan that he wasn't following. The husband didn't stick to their compromise, which could be seen as dismissing her valid fears. The wife's anger is justified because she's trying to protect both their financial situation and her health. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not sticking to their plan and not considering her concerns. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong.\n"
