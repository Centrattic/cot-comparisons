We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn\u2019t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn\u2019t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can\u2019t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, \u201cAre you even interested in this work?\u201d So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we\u2019re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. But I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don\u2019t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I\u2019m pregnant. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation step by step. The user provided a detailed account of a marital conflict regarding whether the husband quitting his job was the right move, especially considering the wife's pregnancy and health issues.\n\nFirst, the husband works at a startup he dislikes. He's new to the field and has no experience. The wife advised him to stay in the job to gain experience, which aligns with her own field's requirement for a PhD. She suggested applying for other jobs while still working. They discussed concerns about financial stability and the husband's ability to find a better job, especially with potential paternity leave.\n\nThen, the husband meets with his boss, who encourages him to quit, offering two months' salary. The wife is pregnant with complications, so the financial and emotional stability is crucial. They agree on a compromise: he'll keep his job while looking for new opportunities and then decide based on the outcome. However, he decides to quit without following through on the agreed plan, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the husband not adhering to the mutual agreement they had. The wife's concerns are valid because of the potential financial strain and her health risks. The husband's decision to quit without considering their discussion might be seen as dismissive of her valid concerns. However, he might feel supported in his career choices and that his immediate dissatisfaction was more pressing.\n\nBut given the context of the wife's health issues and the need for financial stability, the husband's unilateral decision could be seen as not supporting the family's best interests. The wife's support is conditional on financial stability and her health, which are significant factors. The husband's reaction of complaining about lack of support and his dismissive response (\"you should stop talking\") might indicate a lack of empathy towards her situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. Her concerns are legitimate, and the husband didn't follow through on their agreed-upon plan. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
