They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author found out through the group chat that the guy was flirting with her, so they sent a message to the group. Now, the main issue is whether checking the phone was wrong.\n\nFirst, trust and privacy in relationships are important. The author didn't trust the girlfriend and decided to check her phone without her knowledge. That's a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there was flirting involved, the method of handling it was invasive. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to the girlfriend directly instead of snooping. \n\nAlso, the author was drunk when they sent the message, which might have escalated things. Sending a message to the group chat publicly might have been a harsh reaction. The girlfriend getting upset and the argument that followed probably stemmed from the invasion of privacy, not just the content of the message.\n\nSo, even if there was cause for concern, the way the author handled it was wrong. The right approach would have been to communicate their feelings and concerns without violating her privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
