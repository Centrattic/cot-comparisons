They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out after secretly checking her phone. The girlfriend admitted there was a guy involved, and the author discovered they were flirting. The author then sent a message to the group chat, got into an argument, and now is holding onto her phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Even if there's a suspicion of something wrong, respecting each other's privacy is crucial. The author trusted their instincts but violated trust in the process. Then there's the part where they sent a message to the group chat when drunk, which escalated things. \n\nThe girlfriend likely felt betrayed because her privacy was invaded. Arguments can get heated when trust is broken. The author might have felt justified due to the flirting, but that doesn't excuse the initial action of checking the phone. \n\nAlso, holding onto her phone is another issue. That's not a healthy way to handle conflict. Communication and addressing the issue directly, maybe through talking instead of spying, would be better. \n\nSo, the key points are the violation of privacy, the reaction in a group chat while drunk, and the refusal to return the phone. All these actions contribute to the author being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if there were valid concerns, the methods used were inappropriate.\n"
