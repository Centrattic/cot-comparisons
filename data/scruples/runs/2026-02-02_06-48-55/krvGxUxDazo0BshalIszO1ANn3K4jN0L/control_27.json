They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends. The user found out that one of them is a guy, and then checked her WhatsApp messages without her consent. They discovered flirting and sent a message to the group chat. The author admits they were drunk and maybe acted impulsively. Now they have a conflict and are holding onto the phone.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy and trust. Going through someone's phone is generally considered a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason. Jealousy might be a motive, but that doesn't make it right. Even if there was flirting, the author's response was to send a message in the group chat, which could be seen as public shaming. Also, keeping the phone from her now adds more tension. \n\nI should consider societal norms and relationship advice. Typically, trust is crucial in a relationship. If there's suspicion, communication is the better approach rather than sneaking around. The author's actions could erode trust further. Plus, using someone's phone without permission is a breach of boundaries. Even if the girlfriend was being unfaithful, the method of handling it matters. \n\nWait, the author was drunk. That might have affected their judgment, but it's not an excuse. The main issue is the invasion of privacy. So, even if the situation is justified in terms of the girlfriend's actions, the method of dealing with it was wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
