They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author took the phone, looked through WhatsApp messages, found what they considered flirting, and then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now they're holding onto the phone and not sure if they should return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of checking someone's phone without permission. Generally, that's a privacy issue. Even if the person is your partner, accessing their phone without consent is a breach of trust. So that's a point against the author.\n\nThen, the author saw messages where the guy was using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The girlfriend might say those are just friendly terms, so the author might be misinterpreting the context. But the author's action was to confront the group, which could be seen as overreacting, especially when drunk. The argument here is about the justification of the action versus the method used.\n\nThe girlfriend caught the author in the act, leading to a big argument. The author is now holding onto the phone, which is a form of retaliation. That's probably not helping the situation. Retaliation can escalate conflicts instead of resolving them.\n\nSo, the main issues are: invading privacy without consent, acting on possibly misinterpreted messages, confronting others in a public way, and holding onto the phone as leverage. All these actions contribute to the author being in the wrong. The girlfriend might feel her privacy was violated, and the author's response was not constructive. Even if there were legitimate concerns, the approach taken was inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
