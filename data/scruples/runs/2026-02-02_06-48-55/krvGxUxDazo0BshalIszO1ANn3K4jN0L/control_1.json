They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy. The author checked her WhatsApp and found flirtatious messages, then sent a message to the group chat to assert their relationship status. Now they're holding onto her phone and considering not returning it.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust, regardless of the reason. Even if there's jealousy, the method used is problematic. The author's action of checking the phone is invasive. Then, sending a message to the group chat in a drunk state might escalate things unnecessarily. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because her privacy was violated. While the content of the messages might justify some concern, the way the author handled it is where they're wrong. Possessing the phone without returning it is also a bad move. So, the answer is A.\n"
