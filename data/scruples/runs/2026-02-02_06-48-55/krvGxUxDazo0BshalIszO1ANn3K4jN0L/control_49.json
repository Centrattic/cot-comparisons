They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a guy checking his girlfriend's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, and the guy found out one of them is a guy. The guy then went through her phone, read the messages, and found flirting. He confronted them in a group chat, which he sent while drunk. Now, the girlfriend caught him with her phone, they argued, and he's keeping her phone.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is privacy. Even if there's suspicion, going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. The guy might feel jealous, but the method he used is questionable. He didn't talk to her first, he just went through her messages. That's a problem because it's an invasion of her personal space. \n\nAlso, sending a message to the group chat while drunk could be seen as overreacting. He didn't address the issue directly with his girlfriend first, which is the right approach. Confronting her about the messages and discussing boundaries would be better than publicly shaming others. \n\nKeeping her phone after the argument is not a good idea either. It's a form of punishment and can escalate the conflict. It's important to respect each other's property and privacy. \n\nSo, even if the guy had reasons to be concerned, his actions were wrong. The right approach would have been to communicate openly with his girlfriend, express his feelings, and work through the issues together instead of spying and reacting impulsively. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
