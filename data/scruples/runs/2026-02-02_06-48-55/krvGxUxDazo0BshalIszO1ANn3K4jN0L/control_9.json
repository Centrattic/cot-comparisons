They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them going through their girlfriend's phone and then sending a message to a group chat to confront her friends because they were flirting with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a clear violation of privacy. Even if the person had suspicions, that doesn't justify checking their phone. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action breaches that trust.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat while drunk. That's another factor. Being under the influence can impair judgment, leading to actions that might be considered impulsive or extreme. The message they sent was confrontational, which could escalate the situation instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nThe author mentions that they're holding onto the phone, not sure if they want to return it. This shows a lack of resolution and understanding. It's important to return the phone, as keeping it is another invasion of privacy and can be seen as a form of punishment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a big argument, which makes sense because being caught going through her phone would be a serious breach of trust. The author's justification for their actions is based on the flirting, but that doesn't excuse the violation of privacy. Healthy relationships involve communication, not spying. If they had concerns about her spending time with her friends, especially a guy, they should have addressed it directly with her instead of monitoring her phone.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions are wrong. They invaded privacy, acted on their own without discussing the issue, and their response was reactive and possibly influenced by alcohol. The right approach would be to talk openly about their concerns instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
