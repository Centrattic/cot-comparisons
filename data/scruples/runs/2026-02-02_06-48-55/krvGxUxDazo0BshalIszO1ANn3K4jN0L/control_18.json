They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with a guy they previously thought were just her high school friends. \n\nSo, first, the main issue here is going through someone's phone without permission. That's a big no-no in relationships. Privacy is important, and invading it can be really hurtful. The author did that, then confronted the group chat when they were drunk. They also took the phone and didn't return it, which is probably escalating the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend was hanging out with a guy who was flirting with her, but the act of checking the phone without her consent is a violation of trust. Even if there were valid reasons, the method used is problematic. The author's actions might have been a reaction to feeling insecure, but that doesn't justify the invasion of privacy. \n\nAlso, sending a message to the group chat while drunk could have been impulsive and maybe not the best approach. The girlfriend getting upset and the argument that followed are consequences of the author's actions. Holding onto the phone and threatening to not return it is another issue because it's about control and retaliation, not resolving the actual problem.\n\nSo, even though there might be some truth in the guy's flirting, the author's actions in checking the phone and confronting the situation in a harsh way are what's making them responsible here. The right approach would have been to communicate concerns with the girlfriend directly instead of resorting to sneaking through her messages. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
