They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves checking messages without permission and confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor. Even if the girlfriend was hanging out a lot, invading her phone without her consent is a breach of trust. Relationships require mutual respect, and looking through someone's messages without asking is generally considered wrong. \n\nThen there's the reaction. The author sent a message to the group chat, which is pretty confrontational. Being drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it's not an excuse for violating privacy. The girlfriend caught him, leading to an argument and him taking her phone. He's now considering not returning it, which could escalate the conflict. \n\nEven if the guy in the group chat was flirting, the appropriate step would be to talk to the girlfriend first. Confronting the group chat publicly without discussing it with her could be seen as overstepping. The author's actions, while possibly driven by jealousy, don't respect her boundaries and privacy. \n\nSo, combining the unauthorized phone checking and the public confrontation, it seems like the author is at fault. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
