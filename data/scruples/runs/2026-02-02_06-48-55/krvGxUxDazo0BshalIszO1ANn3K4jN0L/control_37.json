They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. First, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with \"high school friends,\" including a guy. The author took her phone without permission, checked her WhatsApp, found flirting, and then confronted the group, causing an argument.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and trust. Going through someone's phone without consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there's suspicion of wrongdoing, the method of investigation matters. The author's actions were unauthorized, which is a big no-no in relationships. Trust is crucial, and breaking that by snooping can lead to more problems. The fact that the author was drunk adds another layer, maybe impulsive behavior. However, the act itself\u2014without consent\u2014is problematic. Even if the outcome was \"justified\" in the author's eyes, the means used are a violation. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, leading to the argument. So, the author is in the wrong because they breached trust and privacy. Answer A.\n"
