They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends. Then they found out one of them is a guy, and they checked her WhatsApp messages. They saw the guy flirting with her, so they sent a message to the group chat to confront them. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. Privacy is a big deal, right? Even in a relationship, people have the right to their own privacy. So just because there's jealousy or suspicion doesn't mean invading someone's private messages is okay. The author was drunk when they did this, which might have led to a hasty decision, but that doesn't excuse the action. \n\nAlso, the way they handled the situation\u2014sneaking into the phone and then publicly confronting in a group chat\u2014could be seen as extreme. Arguing that it was \"justified\" because of the flirting might not hold up. Trust and communication are important in relationships. Instead of spying, maybe they should have talked to their girlfriend about their feelings and concerns first.\n\nAnother point: taking the phone and not returning it is a power move. That seems like it could escalate the conflict instead of resolving it. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or violated, leading to more problems.\n\nBut some might argue that the guy had a right to be concerned since the guy was flirting. However, the method of handling it (without discussing it first) is problematic. So overall, the author's actions likely breached trust and privacy, making them at fault.\n"
