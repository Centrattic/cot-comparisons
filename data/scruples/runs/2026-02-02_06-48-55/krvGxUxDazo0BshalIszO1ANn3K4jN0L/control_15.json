They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with high school friends, including a guy. The author took her phone without permission, checked her WhatsApp, found a group chat with apparent flirting, then sent a message to the group to stop the interaction. The girlfriend found out, they argued, and the author is keeping the phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if the author had suspicions, invading privacy isn't the right approach. Then there's the response\u2014sending a message to the group chat. That's pretty confrontational and could be seen as aggressive, especially when drunk. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she didn't consent to her phone being checked. The argument that follows is a natural consequence of the breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. Jealousy and insecurity can lead people to do things they might regret. The author might feel hurt, but acting on those feelings without communication is problematic. The act of keeping the phone afterward shows that there's lingering resentment or a power play, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nBut wait, what about the girlfriend's actions? She was hanging out with a guy, and there was flirting. However, that doesn't justify the author's actions. The right approach would be to talk to her about the concerns instead of snooping. The author's actions could be seen as an attempt to control her behavior, which can lead to more issues in the relationship.\n\nSo putting it all together: Privacy violation is a major issue here. The author's actions were wrong regardless of the context. The response in the group chat was extreme and unilaterally decided the terms without discussing it with his girlfriend. The fact that he's still holding onto the phone shows he's not ready to resolve the issue through dialogue. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
