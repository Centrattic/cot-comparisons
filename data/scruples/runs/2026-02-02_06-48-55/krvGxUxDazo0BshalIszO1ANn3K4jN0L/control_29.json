They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone and sending a message to a group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author took the phone without permission. That's a big deal because privacy is important in relationships. Even if there were trust issues, accessing someone's phone without their consent is a violation of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend was hanging out with friends, including a guy. The author's reaction was to check her messages and then confront the group. The author admits they were drunk, which might affect their judgment, but that doesn't excuse the action entirely. \n\nNow, the justification: the guy was flirting, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author felt justified in protecting their relationship. But even so, sneaking into her phone and public confrontation might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of spying, a better approach might have been to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns. The author's actions led to an argument and now they're holding onto the phone, which is a sign of control and could escalate things.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: in many places, checking a partner's phone without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Ethically, it's about mutual respect. The author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if motivated by jealousy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, despite the provocation, the author's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, they're in the wrong.\n"
