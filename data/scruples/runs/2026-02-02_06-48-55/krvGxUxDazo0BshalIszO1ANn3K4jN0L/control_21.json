They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big red flag. Privacy is important, and even if there's suspicion of something wrong, invading someone's privacy without their consent is generally considered a violation of trust. The girlfriend was hanging out with friends, including a guy, which led the author to check her messages. Finding flirtatious messages, the author then sent a message to the group chat, which might have been confrontational, especially if they were drunk.\n\nThe main issues here are the unauthorized phone checking and the public confrontation. Even if the author felt jealous, the method they used was disrespectful. Trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. Instead of checking the phone, maybe having an open conversation about their concerns would have been better. The author's actions could be seen as controlling and disrespectful, which might justify the girlfriend's reaction. Also, keeping the phone as leverage isn't healthy. So, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong, so the answer should be A.\n"
