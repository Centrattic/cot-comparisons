They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went through their girlfriend's phone without consent. They found a group chat where a guy was flirting with her, so they sent a message to the group chat to confront them. Now, they're keeping the phone and there's tension.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a clear violation of trust and privacy. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, the method used is problematic. The author acted out of anger and possibly under the influence of alcohol, which might have made the situation worse. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of secretly checking the phone, the right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting her boundaries. Even if the guy was flirting, the way the author handled it\u2014publicly confronting in a group chat\u2014might have been harsh and could have caused unnecessary conflict. \n\nAlso, keeping the phone as leverage is not a healthy way to resolve arguments. It escalates the problem and shows a lack of trust. The fact that they're still holding onto the phone and not returning it suggests a power struggle. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is definitely in the wrong for violating privacy and reacting in a way that's disrespectful and controlling. The answer should be A.\n"
