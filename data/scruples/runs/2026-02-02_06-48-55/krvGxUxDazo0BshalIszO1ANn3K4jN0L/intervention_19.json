They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking the girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if the person is your partner, it's a violation of trust. The author found out through the phone that the girlfriend was in a group chat with a guy who was flirting with her. But the act of checking the phone without permission is the initial problem. \n\nThe user mentioned that the author was drunk, which might have influenced his actions, but that doesn't justify breaking into someone's phone. Privacy is important in relationships, and the expectation here is that partners should communicate openly rather than snoop. \n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. That's another breach, not just of the girlfriend's privacy but also potentially affecting her friendships. Even if the guy was flirting, confronting them publicly like that could escalate the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend caught him with her phone, leading to an argument. The author now has the phone but isn't sure if he should return it. That shows he's aware there's a problem, but holding onto the phone is another issue. \n\nSo, even though the author might feel justified due to the flirting, the initial act of checking the phone without consent is a clear violation. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about his concerns instead of invading her privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
