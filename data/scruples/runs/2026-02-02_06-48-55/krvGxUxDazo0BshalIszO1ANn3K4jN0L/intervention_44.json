They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going through their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with someone who's been flirting with her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found out that the girlfriend's high school friends include a guy who's clearly flirting with her. The author took the phone, read the messages, and then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now they're holding onto the phone and not sure if they should return it.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and trust. The author admitted to going through the girlfriend's phone without her consent. That's a big no-no in most relationships. Even if the content of the messages might be upsetting, invading someone's privacy is generally considered wrong. The act of reading someone else's messages without permission is a breach of trust and can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. The user says they were a bit drunk and maybe extreme, which adds that they acted impulsively. Confronting others in a group chat without discussing it with the girlfriend first might escalate the situation. The girlfriend might have wanted to handle it herself, or there could be miscommunication about the nature of the interactions with the guy.\n\nThe author is now holding onto the phone, which is a form of retaliation and can cause further conflict. Instead of addressing the issue directly with the girlfriend, they're using the phone as leverage. That's not a healthy way to resolve conflicts.\n\nWhile the author might feel justified due to the flirting, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend first, express their feelings, and work together to address the situation. Going behind her back and taking matters into their own hands by checking her phone and public confrontation undermines trust and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions of invading privacy and the public confrontation are problematic. Even if the underlying issue (flirting) is valid, the way they handled it is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
