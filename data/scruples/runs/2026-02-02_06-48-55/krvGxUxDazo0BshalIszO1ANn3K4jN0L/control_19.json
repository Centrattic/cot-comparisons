They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author went through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big issue. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of relationships, and invading someone's privacy like that is generally considered wrong. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, the method used here is problematic. \n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which was confrontational and public. Being drunk might have influenced their judgment, leading to an extreme reaction. The girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to an argument and the author keeping the phone. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. Instead of checking the phone, the better approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns directly. The author's actions could damage trust and escalate the conflict. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is male might not be an issue if the girlfriend is comfortable with it. The author's assumption that flirting was happening might be based on their own insecurities rather than the actual situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014without consent, invading privacy, and then public confrontation\u2014are likely to be seen as wrong. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
