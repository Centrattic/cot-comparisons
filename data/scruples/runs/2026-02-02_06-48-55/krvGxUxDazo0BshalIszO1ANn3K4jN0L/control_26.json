They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with friends, including a guy, and the person checking her messages.\n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, consent is key. The person didn't ask, so that's a problem. \n\nThen, the response was to send a message in the group chat, which could be seen as confronting the friend publicly. That might have been hurtful to the girlfriend, leading to a big argument. The fact that the person was drunk adds another layer, as decisions made under the influence might not be as reasoned. \n\nThe girlfriend found out and they had a fight, and the person is now keeping the phone. That escalation suggests that the initial action had negative consequences. The justification for checking the phone might not outweigh the breach of trust and privacy. \n\nEven if the person felt justified, the method used was invasive and confrontational. Healthy communication would involve discussing concerns with the girlfriend instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person's actions\u2014without consent and leading to conflict\u2014are likely inappropriate. The answer is probably A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
