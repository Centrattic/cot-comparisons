They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about going through their girlfriend's phone, finding out she's hanging out with someone who's flirting with her, and then confronting them in a group chat when drunk. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big red flag. Privacy is important in relationships, and checking someone's phone without their consent is generally seen as a violation of trust. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy involved, the method of addressing it matters.\n\nThen, the girlfriend was spending time with high school friends, including a guy who was flirting in the group chat. The author sent a message to the group chat, which might have come off as confrontational or public shaming, especially while drunk. That could escalate the situation and cause more harm than good. \n\nThe author is holding onto the phone now, not returning it. This could lead to further conflict and might be an attempt to exert control, which isn't healthy. The argument that followed suggests that the approach was not constructive.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the act of going through someone's phone without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the intentions were to protect the relationship, the method used was problematic. Healthy relationships involve communication and trust. Instead of sneaking around and confronting others publicly, a better approach would be to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns and address any issues together.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while possibly stemming from feelings of insecurity or jealousy, were not appropriate. The main wrong here is the invasion of privacy through the phone and the public confrontation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
