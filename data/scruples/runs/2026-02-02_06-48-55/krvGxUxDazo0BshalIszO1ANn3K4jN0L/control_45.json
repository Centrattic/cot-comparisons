They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author checking their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with someone from her high school friends, who turns out to be a guy. The author then went through her WhatsApp messages, found flirting, and sent a message in the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is privacy. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without her consent. Even if there was a reason, like suspecting cheating or inappropriate behavior, invading someone's privacy is generally considered wrong. Trust is a big part of relationships, and violating that by checking someone's phone without permission is a red flag.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of meeting with her friends, including a guy she admitted to being with, might be problematic. But the author's response was to invade her privacy and confront the group publicly. Even if the author was drunk, that doesn't justify the actions. The public shaming aspect could also be an issue, as it's confrontational and not a mature way to handle the situation.\n\nAlso, keeping the phone after the argument is a form of retaliation, which isn't healthy. The right approach would have been to address the issue through open communication rather than spying. While the girlfriend might have overstepped by hanging out with someone in a way that caused jealousy, the author's method of dealing with it is definitely not acceptable. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
