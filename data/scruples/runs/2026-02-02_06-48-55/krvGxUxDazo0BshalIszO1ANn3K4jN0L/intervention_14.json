They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves checking a girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via a group chat.\n\nFirst, the author admitted to going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there was a reason, like jealousy over her hanging out with friends, including a guy, the act of secretly accessing her messages is a breach of trust. \n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which was a public confrontation. Being drunk adds to the impulsiveness, but that doesn't excuse the action. The girlfriend was upset, and the argument that followed probably made things worse. \n\nThe author is holding onto her phone and considering not returning it, which is another escalation. Trust is crucial in relationships, and this action could lead to long-term damage. While the girlfriend's behavior might have been questionable, the author's approach was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for invading privacy and handling the situation poorly.\n"
