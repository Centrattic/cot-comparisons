They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about going through their girlfriend's phone. So, the user is asking if that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, and one of them is a guy. The author found out through the phone that there's flirting happening in a group chat. Then they sent a message to the group chat to confront them and told the girlfriend she can't go out with them if the guy is there. They also mention being a bit drunk when they did this.\n\nNow, the key issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no in most relationships. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, it's still a breach of trust. The author admitted to taking the phone from her bag and reading her messages. That's a violation of her privacy, regardless of the motive.\n\nAlso, sending a message to the group chat to confront them might have been a way to address the issue, but doing it without discussing it with his girlfriend first could have made things worse. The argument that followed suggests that the approach was confrontational and possibly harsh, especially if done under the influence of alcohol. The fact that he kept her phone and isn't sure if he wants to return it shows that the situation is still unresolved and possibly damaging the relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author might have felt hurt or insecure, the method they used to address the problem was inappropriate. The act of invading privacy, regardless of the reason, is generally considered wrong. The right approach would have been to talk to his girlfriend about his concerns and address the issue together, not unilaterally take action without discussing it first.\n"
