They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the others via a group chat.\n\nFirst, the main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, that doesn't justify the action. The girlfriend might have a right to her own privacy and autonomy in her relationships. \n\nNext, the author's response was to send a message to the group chat, which is pretty confrontational. They were drunk, which might have influenced their judgment, making the action more impulsive. The fact that they took the phone and refused to return it adds to the conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction leading to an argument suggests that the author's actions were out of line. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping undermines that trust. Also, confronting others in such a public way (group chat) without discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as escalation rather than communication. \n\nEven though there might be valid concerns about the girlfriend's interactions, the method used here is problematic. Healthy relationships require open communication rather than spying. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer seems to be that the author is in the wrong. The invasion of privacy and the way they handled the situation are definitely not the right approach.\n"
