They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. So first, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe main issue is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, the method used here is problematic. The author took the phone without asking and read messages, which is a violation of privacy.\n\nThen there's the context. The girlfriend was hanging out with high school friends, which the author later found out included a guy. The author saw messages where the guy was using affectionate nicknames, leading to the confrontation. However, the author's response was to send a message to the group chat, which seems aggressive and public. They were also drunk, which might have clouded their judgment and made the situation worse.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Instead of secretly checking the phone, the author could have talked to the girlfriend about their concerns. The argument that followed suggests there was a lack of open communication. The fact that the author still has the phone and is considering not returning it shows a possible attempt to exert control, which is unhealthy.\n\nLegally and ethically, privacy is important. Even in relationships, individuals have the right to their own space. The author's actions, while driven by jealousy, are not justified because they violated trust and privacy. The consequences, like the big argument and the girlfriend being upset, indicate that the action was inappropriate.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author had feelings of insecurity, the method they used to address it was wrong. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
