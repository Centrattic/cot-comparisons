They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went through their girlfriend's phone without her permission. The girlfriend has been spending time with her high school friends, including a guy who was clearly flirting with her. The author, upon finding this out, checked her WhatsApp messages and then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. They were drunk, and now there's a big argument, and the author is holding onto the phone.\n\nSo the main issue here is going through someone's phone. Even if there's a reason, like suspicion of flirting, invading someone's privacy is a big deal. Trust is crucial in relationships. The author's actions might have been driven by jealousy, but the method of checking the phone without consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, sending a message to the group chat in a group setting, especially when drunk, could be seen as harsh or public shaming. The girlfriend's reaction makes sense because her privacy was violated. The author is holding onto the phone now, which might be a form of retaliation, but that's not resolving the issue constructively.\n\nEven if the author felt justified, the means used were wrong. The right approach would have been to communicate their feelings to the girlfriend directly instead of spying on her. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because invading privacy and acting out in a public way without addressing the issue privately is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
