They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her about it after finding messages with a guy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big no-no in most relationships. Privacy is important, and even if there's suspicion or jealousy, invading someone's privacy without consent is generally considered wrong. \n\nThen, when they found the messages, they sent a message to the group chat, which might have been confrontational. The author mentions being drunk, which could affect judgment, but that doesn't excuse the actions. \n\nThe girlfriend caught him with her phone, leading to an argument. He's keeping her phone now, which is another issue because withholding something someone owns is not right. \n\nEven if the messages were suggestive, the method of handling it was extreme. Trust issues should be addressed through communication, not by spying or public confrontations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issues are invading privacy, reacting impulsively, and withholding property. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
