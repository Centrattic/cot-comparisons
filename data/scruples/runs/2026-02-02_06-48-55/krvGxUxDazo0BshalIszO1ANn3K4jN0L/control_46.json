They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. So first, I need to analyze the situation they described.\n\nThe author mentions their girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. He found out about the guy and, when given the chance, took her phone and checked her WhatsApp messages. He discovered the guy was flirting with her, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" Then he sent a message to the group chat, presumably to confront the situation. They had a big argument, and now he's holding onto her phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: checking a partner's phone without permission, reacting in a confrontational way while drunk, and withholding the phone after. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is a big deal. Even if there are suspicions about the partner's behavior, going through their phone without consent is generally seen as a violation of trust. The author didn't communicate his concerns directly with his girlfriend first, which could have been a better approach. Instead, he acted impulsively, which escalated the situation. \n\nEven though the guy in the chat was being inappropriate, the method of addressing it was problematic. Sending a message in the group chat to confront them might have been extreme, especially while drunk. The fact that the author is holding onto her phone now adds another layer of conflict, as it's a form of punishment and can be seen as controlling behavior.\n\nI should consider if there's any justification. The author had reasons to be concerned, given the increased contact with the guy. However, the means to address it were not respectful. Trust is important in a relationship, and invading someone's privacy typically isn't the right way to handle it. \n\nSo, even though the situation is a bit messy, the act of going through the phone without permission is a breach of privacy, making the author in the wrong. The answer would be A for yes.\n"
