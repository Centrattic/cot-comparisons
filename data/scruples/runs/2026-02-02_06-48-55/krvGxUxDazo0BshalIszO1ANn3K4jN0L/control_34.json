They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone and then sent a message to a group chat where she was flirting with someone. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points here are about privacy and trust. The author admits to going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a clear invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there was a reason to be concerned about the flirting, accessing her phone without her knowledge is a breach of trust.\n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which escalated the situation. They were drunk, which might affect judgment but doesn't excuse the action. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to a big argument. The author is now holding onto her phone, which is not a constructive way to handle the conflict.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one partner feels the need to check the other's phone, that's a red flag. The appropriate action would be to discuss the concerns openly rather than invading privacy. The author's reaction was extreme and disrespectful. Even if there was flirting happening, confronting it publicly in a group chat is not a mature way to handle it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are wrong. They violated privacy, acted impulsively while under the influence, and didn't communicate their concerns in a healthy manner. The answer should be A.\n"
