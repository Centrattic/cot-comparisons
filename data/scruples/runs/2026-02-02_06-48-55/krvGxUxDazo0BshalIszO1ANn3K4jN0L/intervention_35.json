They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if there are suspicions, respecting each other's privacy is crucial in a relationship. The author did that, which is a clear breach of trust.\n\nThen, when they found out about the group chat with a guy who was flirting, they sent a message to the group while drunk. That's another problem. Acting on jealousy and using alcohol as an excuse isn't a good defense. It's important to handle situations calmly and communicate directly with the partner, not through third parties.\n\nThe argument that followed was because the girlfriend found out they had her phone. The author is now holding onto the phone, which seems like an ultimatum. This kind of behavior can escalate conflicts and damage the relationship further. \n\nEven if the girlfriend was acting suspicious by hanging out a lot with others, the right approach would be to talk to her about the feelings instead of snooping. The author's actions, while perhaps driven by jealousy, are not justified. Trust and open communication are key, not invasion of privacy or public confrontations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author definitely made mistakes here. The answer should be A.\n"
