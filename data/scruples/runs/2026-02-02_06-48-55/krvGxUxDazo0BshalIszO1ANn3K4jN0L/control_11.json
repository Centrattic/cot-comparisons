They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend spending a lot of time with former high school friends, including a guy who's been flirting in group chats. The author took her phone, read messages, then confronted the group.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big issue here. Checking someone's phone without consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there were concerns about her interactions, that doesn't justify sneaking into her messages. Trust and communication should be the foundation of a relationship. Instead of confronting her directly, the author took a more extreme step, which could damage trust.\n\nAlso, the author sent a message to the group chat while drunk, which might have been impulsive and harsh. The girlfriend getting her phone taken and the argument that followed show that this action caused immediate conflict. Holding onto her phone now adds more tension and isn't a healthy resolution.\n\nEven if the guy was flirting, the appropriate approach would be to talk to the girlfriend first, express concerns, and address the issue together. The author's actions bypassed communication and respect for her privacy, which are key in any relationship. So, the answer here is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
