They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with friends, including a guy, and the author found flirtatious messages in a group chat. They confronted the group when drunk, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is invading privacy. Checking someone's phone without permission is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy. Even if there's suspicion of wrongdoing, sneaking around to look through messages is not a healthy way to handle it. The author's actions could be seen as a violation of their girlfriend's privacy, regardless of their motivations.\n\nThe author mentions they were drunk when they sent the message to the group chat. Being under the influence might have influenced their judgment, making the situation more volatile. However, the act of going through the phone itself was done while sober, as they had to take the phone from the bag. That part isn't excused by being drunk.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction and the resulting argument suggest that the author's actions hurt her and damaged trust. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. Instead of confronting the group chat in public, a better approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly about the concerns. The author's method of addressing it indirectly and publicly might have been perceived as shaming or controlling.\n\nEven if the messages were indeed flirtatious, the author's response was extreme and not discussed with the girlfriend first. Holding onto the phone and not returning it adds to the tension and shows a lack of willingness to resolve the issue maturely. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have felt insecure or jealous, the method they used to address it was inappropriate. The answer is A because their actions violated privacy and trust, and the response was overly aggressive without direct communication.\n"
