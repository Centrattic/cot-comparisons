They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone and sent a message to a group chat where she was flirting with a guy. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, the key points here are: the author checked the phone without permission, which is a privacy issue. Then they sent a message in the group chat, which is a public confrontation. Even though the girlfriend was flirting, the method the author used is questionable. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. Snooping through someone's phone is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Even if there's jealousy, the right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend directly instead of going behind her back. The author's actions might have been driven by insecurity or fear, but the method used was invasive and confrontational.\n\nThe author mentions they were drunk, which might affect judgment, but that doesn't excuse the action. Also, not returning the phone is holding it over her head, which isn't healthy. The argument that followed probably escalated because of the initial invasion of privacy.\n\nMost people would consider the author at fault because of the phone checking and the public message. They should have addressed the issue with the girlfriend directly instead of spying. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
