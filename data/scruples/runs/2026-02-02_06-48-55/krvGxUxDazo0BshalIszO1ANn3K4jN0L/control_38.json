They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author went through their girlfriend's phone after finding out that one of the friends she's been hanging out with is a guy. They saw flirtatious messages in a group chat and then sent a message to the group, which included their girlfriend, stating she had a boyfriend and not to go out with them if the guy was there. The author was drunk and now they're having an argument, and they're holding onto the phone.\n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Privacy is important in relationships. Even if the author is jealous or worried, invading someone's privacy isn't the right approach. Jealousy is a common feeling, but how you handle it matters. Sending a message to a group chat where you overhear flirting might be a reaction, but doing so without talking to the girlfriend first could escalate things. The author didn't confront her directly first, which might have been a better approach. Also, holding onto her phone as leverage after the argument isn't helpful. It's understandable that emotions are high when drunk, but that doesn't justify the actions. The key points here are breaking trust by checking the phone and not addressing the issue through communication. So, the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
