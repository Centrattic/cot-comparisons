They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author found out via her messages that she was flirting with this guy, got drunk, and sent a confrontational message to the group chat, then kept her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author went through her girlfriend's phone without consent. That's a privacy violation. Even if they're in a relationship, one person doesn't have the right to access the other's personal messages unless there's a mutual agreement. So that's a red flag.\n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which was confrontational. That's a public shaming sort of move, which can be hurtful. The fact that they were drunk when they did this might have clouded their judgment, but that doesn't excuse the actions. The girlfriend caught them, leading to an argument and the author keeping her phone. Withholding the phone is another problem because it's a form of control or punishment, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, which makes sense. But I need to consider if there's any justification. The girlfriend was indeed flirting, so the author might feel betrayed. However, the way they handled it is problematic. Instead of addressing the issue directly and respectfully, they acted impulsively and invasively. The right approach would be to talk to her about the behavior and express their feelings, not to snoop and then retaliate by keeping her phone.\n\nAlso, trust is a big part of relationships. By invading her privacy, the author is eroding that trust. Even if the girlfriend's actions were wrong, the author's response is not the solution. The author's actions could lead to further conflict and damage the relationship more than the initial issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: invading privacy, acting out in the heat of the moment, public confrontation, and withholding the phone are all negative actions. The author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
