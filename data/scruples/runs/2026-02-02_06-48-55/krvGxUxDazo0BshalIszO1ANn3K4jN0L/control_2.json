They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone without her permission and then confronting the friends in a group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The key points here are:\n\n1. The author went through their girlfriend's phone. That's the main action. Checking someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a breach of privacy, regardless of the relationship. Even in romantic relationships, people have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n2. The girlfriend has been spending time with her \"high school friends,\" which the author later finds out includes a guy. The author's discovery of the guy in the group chat and the flirtatious messages leads them to take a confrontational approach.\n\n3. The author was drunk when they sent the message to the group chat, which might have influenced their actions. They admitted it was extreme but felt justified. \n\n4. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to a big argument. The author is now hungover and considering not returning the phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized access to the girlfriend's phone. Even if there was a reason (like suspecting something wrong), the act of going through her messages without permission is a violation. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. The author's justification is that the messages were clearly flirting, but the initial act of checking the phone is still problematic. \n\nThen, the response to the group chat. They sent a message to the group, which might have been a way to address the situation, but doing it publicly and while drunk could be seen as impulsive and harsh. Confronting someone in a group setting can escalate the conflict, and being drunk might have made the message more confrontational than necessary.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (argument) suggests that she didn't consent to the phone check, so the author's actions crossed a line. Even if their intention was to protect the relationship, the method was unethical. Relationships require trust and communication, not snooping. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they violated their girlfriend's privacy. The answer should be A.\n"
